## Notes
From SCY's Nyaa description:
> I tweaked the timing of the OP/ED karaoke to be more consistent with fades and scenechanges in the video, restyled the dialogue, reworked some of the TS, removed the ‘TS notes’ (I thought they looked horrendous and usually didn’t add much to the scene) and fixed a couple more errors and scenebleeds that UTW left. I was also able to add italics for all kinds of dialogue that needed it (TV, phone talk, internal thoughts, et cetera) thanks to the extensive work my friend basheer_naimi provided.
