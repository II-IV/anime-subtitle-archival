What?

18
00:03:22,594 --> 00:03:24,434
About our conversation yesterday...

19
00:03:24,434 --> 00:03:24,994
Yeah?

20
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:25,904
Run! You dropped your notebook.

21
00:03:25,904 --> 00:03:27,874
It looks like the latest issue is out already.
Run! You dropped your notebook.

I-I-I'm sorry! I'll erase it from memory,
so please don't kill me!

27
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:44,554
I'm sorry!

28
00:03:44,554 --> 00:03:46,044
What are you talking about?

29
00:03:46,254 --> 00:03:51,094
This is a notebook where you write the names of
people you hate so they'll be cursed, right?

30
00:03:51,094 --> 00:03:56,824
No! I'm doing a notebook exchange with Toru.
That's her page.

31
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,554
Then what are all these names?

32
00:03:59,804 --> 00:04:01,534
A memory test!

33
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:06,334
We're competing to see who can remember the
most names of people we've come across so far.

34
00:04:06,674 --> 00:04:08,304
Why would they do that?

35
00:04:08,614 --> 00:04:13,484
She has a great memory, huh?
I may not have a chance.

36
00:04:13,484 --> 00:04:19,324
Also, suddenly all the names are foreign.
Don't tell me Toru used to live overseas!

37
00:04:19,324 --> 00:04:23,124
No, she said those are names
from manga she's read.

38
00:04:23,124 --> 00:04:25,694
Oh. That's why they're so weird.

57
00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:04,064
What is it?

58
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,804
So, what did Toru say?

59
00:05:09,074 --> 00:05:12,004
That she has something to show us,
so please come by the house.

60
00:05:12,244 --> 00:05:14,174
Huh. What could it be?

61
00:05:14,474 --> 00:05:18,344
This'll be my first time to Toru's house,
so I'm lookin' forward to it.

62
00:05:18,344 --> 00:05:19,504
Me, too.

63
00:05:19,984 --> 00:05:21,854
I wonder what kind of place she lives in...

64
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,784
You'll know, soon.

65
00:05:27,454 --> 00:05:28,514
This is it.

66
00:05:30,724 --> 00:05:33,524
Toru sure lives in a nice place!

67
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:34,724
Let's go.

68
00:05:36,094 --> 00:05:40,294
Silly Toru. We said we'd help her clean
so she didn't have to leave ahead of us.

69
00:05:40,534 --> 00:05:43,024
Could there be something
she didn't want us to see?

70
00:05:46,704 --> 00:05:47,694
What's wrong?

71
00:05:50,344 --> 00:05:50,484
STEP

72
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:50,684
STEP
This is like a foot massager, and it feels good!

73
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:50,844
This is like a foot massager, and it feels good!

74
00:05:50,844 --> 00:05:51,184
STEP
This is like a foot massager, and it feels good!

This is like a foot massager, and it feels good!

81
00:05:52,844 --> 00:05:53,014
This is like a foot massager, and it feels good!

82
00:05:53,014 --> 00:05:53,344
STEP
This is like a foot massager, and it feels good!

00:05:53,344 --> 00:05:53,384
This is like a foot massager, and it feels good!

84
00:05:53,384 --> 00:05:53,514

Quit actin' like an old lady and let's go!

Quit actin' like an old lady and let's go!

STEP
Quit actin' like an old lady and let's go!

94
00:05:58,554 --> 00:06:00,454
Toru! We're here!

95
00:06:02,794 --> 00:06:04,484
It's open, so come in.

96
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:05,524
Okay!

97
00:06:06,764 --> 00:06:07,764
Here we come.

98
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:09,164
Here we come.
Here we come.

99
00:06:16,204 --> 00:06:18,034
Toru. We're coming in.

100
00:06:23,274 --> 00:06:24,404
How dirty!

101
00:06:26,544 --> 00:06:28,944
Is Toru the kind of girl who can't clean?

102
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:34,654
No. Usually, it's so clean,
it's almost too much. So this...

SPIHC
OTATOP

104
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:36,724

A room in disarray!

105
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:38,354
Its occupant missing!

106
00:06:38,994 --> 00:06:40,584
A window locked from the inside!

107
00:06:41,164 --> 00:06:42,594
It's a locked-room murder!

108
00:06:42,594 --> 00:06:44,364
The front door was OPEN.

109
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:48,004
Huh? This room isn't really dirty.

110
00:06:48,304 --> 00:06:51,134
If you look closely, the trash has been
knocked out of the trash can, that's it.

111
00:06:51,474 --> 00:06:54,344
So the trash came out for a walk, eh?

112
00:06:54,344 --> 00:06:56,604
There's no way it grew arms and legs!

113
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,744
Eek! Humans!

114
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:07,224
I get it.

115
00:07:08,354 --> 00:07:10,094
Should we go ahead and clean up?

116
00:07:10,094 --> 00:07:10,894
Yeah.

117
00:07:10,894 --> 00:07:14,054
Run-chan, what you're thinking
is probably wrong.

118
00:07:14,594 --> 00:07:16,634
I'm sorry for the mess.

119
00:07:16,634 --> 00:07:18,624
This one tore the room up.

120
00:07:19,364 --> 00:07:20,734
"This one"?

121
00:07:24,504 --> 00:07:26,704
How cute!

122
00:07:26,944 --> 00:07:28,744
What's with this cat?

123
00:07:28,944 --> 00:07:32,974
I found it this morning.
It looks like it was abandoned.

124
00:07:33,384 --> 00:07:35,644
A Oranges

125
00:07:36,314 --> 00:07:39,484
Oh! Cats have limbs too, don't they?

126
00:07:39,484 --> 00:07:41,184
I don't know what that means.

127
00:07:41,324 --> 00:07:43,294
And they're personified, too.

128
00:07:43,294 --> 00:07:44,754
What are you talking about?

129
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:47,364
If they did, I think they'd be Toru!

130
00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:48,294
That...

131
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:50,464
I think I can see that.

132
00:07:50,464 --> 00:07:51,594
Right?!

133
00:07:51,734 --> 00:07:53,364
What does that mean?

134
00:07:57,034 --> 00:07:57,874
See you.

135
00:07:57,874 --> 00:07:59,464
See you tomorrow!

136
00:08:00,044 --> 00:08:02,414
Take care of that cat, okay?

137
00:08:02,414 --> 00:08:03,504
Later.

138
00:08:05,614 --> 00:08:08,584
It's gotten cold, huh? Toru, you okay?

139
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:09,714
Yeah.

140
00:08:10,054 --> 00:08:13,154
Oh! Wanna eat something on the way back?

141
00:08:13,154 --> 00:08:15,494
Yeah. Something sweet would be good.

142
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:19,764
How about a restaurant?
Let's go by the shopping arcade.

143
00:08:19,764 --> 00:08:24,494
The shopping arcade, huh?
Can we take a bit of a detour?

144
00:08:27,804 --> 00:08:30,864
I thought it was around here...

145
00:08:31,074 --> 00:08:32,574
Where are we going?

146
00:08:32,574 --> 00:08:34,144
I want to buy a collar.

147
00:08:34,144 --> 00:08:35,814
Oh, I see.

148
00:08:35,814 --> 00:08:38,304
I'd like to get some cat toys while I'm at it.

149
00:08:39,014 --> 00:08:40,384
Toys?

150
00:08:41,614 --> 00:08:43,584
THAT I know!

151
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:45,574
TOYS

152
00:08:45,824 --> 00:08:48,394
This place is sure to have them!

153
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:48,994
ADULT TOYS

154
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:51,094
ADULT TOYS
I'm sure you're right.

155
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:52,564
ADULT TOYS
But you're wrong!

156
00:08:53,794 --> 00:08:55,164
Welcome.

157
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:07,174
It's a white cat, so what color
would suit it? Red? Blue?

158
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,834
She's so serious...

159
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:12,744
You think that cat's really important, don't you?

160
00:09:13,714 --> 00:09:16,114
I think YOU'RE important, too.

161
00:09:17,654 --> 00:09:18,824
I know.

162
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,254
That tickles...

163
00:09:22,324 --> 00:09:24,194
Welcome to Goonies!

164
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,054
My apologies for the wait.

165
00:09:26,594 --> 00:09:27,894
Please have a seat here.

166
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:30,334
Toru, you take the booth side.

167
00:09:30,334 --> 00:09:32,194
No, Run-chan, you.

168
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,064
We should just sit together, right?

169
00:09:38,104 --> 00:09:40,304
SPOUT

170
00:09:40,544 --> 00:09:44,774
Oh, that's right. About my cat...

171
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,644
The drink bar makes it hard to choose, huh?

172
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:54,354
How many kinds are you putting in there?

173
00:09:54,354 --> 00:09:57,194
It's a delicious mixed juice of FIVE varieties!

174
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:01,454
You hadn't thought of a name for the cat yet?

175
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,064
I can't come up with a good one.

176
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:08,734
What about the name of a snack or a drink?
You like those, right?

177
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:10,224
Oh, that's good.

178
00:10:10,574 --> 00:10:18,274
This has cola, cider, ramune,
ginger ale and melon soda in it.

179
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:21,874
Put them together and you get Carbonation!

180
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,354
We're home!

181
00:10:27,854 --> 00:10:32,454
You been doing well? Starting today,
your name is Carbonation!

182
00:10:33,024 --> 00:10:35,064
Well-behaved, isn't it?

183
00:10:35,064 --> 00:10:37,654
Sometimes it runs wild, though.

184
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:43,064
Carbonation, your collar suits you.
So cute, so cute!

185
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,204
You want food? I'll give you some right now.

186
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:53,184
We got some toys for you too,
so let's play with them later, okay?

187
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,614
Run-chan, let's talk.

188
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,684
I never got Run's attention back...

189
00:11:35,454 --> 00:11:37,224
Good morning, Carbonation.

190
00:11:41,264 --> 00:11:46,094
Tickle-tickle. Tickle. Tickle-tickle-tickle-tickle.
Tickle-tickle. Tickle.

191
00:11:47,034 --> 00:11:50,564
It's this late already? I have to get changed.

192
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:06,844
No, you'll get fur on my uniform.
This is no time for rolling around.

193
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:11,164
Starting this morning, today is going
to be an extremely cold one.

194
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:16,534
There is a high probability of snowfall in the afternoon,
so please take care when leaving the house.

195
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,094
It can't be helped...

196
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:30,974
Okay, I'll be back.

197
00:13:03,544 --> 00:13:05,274
Good morning, Toru.

198
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,884
It's going to get colder today, huh?

199
00:13:12,654 --> 00:13:16,054
It's supposed to snow, Run-chan.
The forecast said so.

200
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:18,414
Hold on a minute!

201
00:13:29,004 --> 00:13:30,304
What's the matter?

202
00:13:33,044 --> 00:13:34,274
Ta-daa!

203
00:13:34,544 --> 00:13:34,944
STRAWBERRY

I got some syrup!

205
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,344
For the snow?

206
00:13:39,344 --> 00:13:40,474
Yup!

207
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,614
Yuko-chan, good morning.

208
00:13:47,184 --> 00:13:50,554
'Morning. It's cold right off the bat today, huh?

209
00:13:50,554 --> 00:13:51,544
Yeah.

210
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,224
Good morning.

211
00:13:53,724 --> 00:13:54,454
Good mor-

212
00:13:56,364 --> 00:13:58,834
Nagi! What's with that getup?!

213
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:02,004
The forecast said snow, so I planned ahead.

214
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,704
You look like an assassin. So cool!

215
00:14:04,704 --> 00:14:06,974
Won't you be mistaken for a pervert?

216
00:14:08,774 --> 00:14:14,274
Jeez. Why do we have to come to school
when it's this cold?

217
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:17,084
Of course we do. We're students.

218
00:14:20,424 --> 00:14:24,724
Don't you think that once fall is over,
we should be off till spring?!

219
00:14:25,294 --> 00:14:27,164
You hate winter, don't you?

220
00:14:27,164 --> 00:14:30,094
In the summer, you just kept saying,
"It's hot, it's hot."

221
00:14:30,294 --> 00:14:33,634
At this rate, if snow falls,
I'm not sure I'll be able to live!

222
00:14:33,634 --> 00:14:35,364
Why're you so glum?

223
00:14:35,604 --> 00:14:38,004
Snow is nothing but fun!

224
00:14:38,004 --> 00:14:38,494
Huh?

225
00:14:38,774 --> 00:14:43,264
You can make snowmen and make igloos
and have snowball fights!

226
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:46,874
So Nagi, you need to pray that snow falls, too!

227
00:14:51,354 --> 00:14:55,054
Did you not listen to what I said?!

228
00:14:55,424 --> 00:14:56,584

You haven't given up yet, have you?

235
00:15:20,914 --> 00:15:23,254
I've halfway given up.

236
00:15:23,254 --> 00:15:24,874
Give up ALL the way!

237
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:28,584
Ah! It started snowing!

238
00:15:30,254 --> 00:15:31,194
What?!

239
00:15:32,294 --> 00:15:33,424
Awesome!

240
00:15:33,664 --> 00:15:35,324
Wow!

241
00:15:36,864 --> 00:15:38,634
Sure enough. Snow.

242
00:15:38,634 --> 00:15:41,564
Bleh. This weather changes on a dime, huh?

243
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,494
Run, good th-

244
00:15:44,304 --> 00:15:45,364
She's gone.

245
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:48,144
It's here! Food, food!

246
00:15:48,144 --> 00:15:50,274
Eat your LUNCH, not the snow!

247
00:16:06,394 --> 00:16:08,094
Looks like it's gonna start piling up.

248
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,594
It's really coming down!

249
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:14,624
If a lot piles up, I'd like to try this:

250
00:16:16,874 --> 00:16:19,534
And get buried so deep, I can't see the bottom!

251
00:16:21,544 --> 00:16:22,914
Like something from a manga, huh?

252
00:16:22,914 --> 00:16:24,904
Maybe I can do it if I jump here.

253
00:16:25,544 --> 00:16:27,244
Uh, I don't think...

254
00:16:27,244 --> 00:16:29,214
Fine, then from the roof!

255
00:16:30,784 --> 00:16:32,544
I think it's no good.

256
00:16:53,074 --> 00:16:55,974
It piled up! Great, isn't it?

257
00:16:56,244 --> 00:16:57,764
Okay, let's go!

258
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:58,914
Yeah.

259
00:17:01,914 --> 00:17:03,074
Yaay!

260
00:17:07,754 --> 00:17:10,654
R-Run-chan? You dead?

261
00:17:16,964 --> 00:17:18,164
She's eating it!

262
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:19,364
Run-chan, no!

263
00:17:20,034 --> 00:17:22,094
You all jump in, too!

264
00:17:28,474 --> 00:17:30,964
Hey, don't do that.

265
00:17:37,114 --> 00:17:37,944
What?

266
00:17:38,154 --> 00:17:40,784
Yuko-chan, that's a strange pose.

267
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,094
Good job, Yuko.

268
00:17:43,094 --> 00:17:44,584
Jeez!

269
00:17:44,994 --> 00:17:46,464
Snow...

270
00:17:49,264 --> 00:17:52,004
Snow is warm, isn't it?

271
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,224
Nagi!

272
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,874
Nagi, you okay?

273
00:17:59,804 --> 00:18:00,874
She looks cold.

274
00:18:00,874 --> 00:18:02,304
That's it!

275
00:18:02,674 --> 00:18:05,074
I'll warm Nagi-chan up!

276
00:18:08,084 --> 00:18:10,054
What are you doing, Run-chan?

277
00:18:10,154 --> 00:18:13,214
I thought I'd make an igloo for Nagi-chan!

278
00:18:13,754 --> 00:18:17,594
Ah! That IS warm, isn't it? I'll help!

279
00:18:40,214 --> 00:18:43,114
Okay! Nagi-chan, it's done!

280
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,254
Looks cramped...

281
00:18:46,484 --> 00:18:48,294
Nagi, is it warm?

282
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,294
Yeah. More than outside.

283
00:18:50,294 --> 00:18:51,554
I'm glad.

284
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:57,624
You're wide open, Yuko-chan.

285
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:58,564
Hyaa!

286
00:19:05,374 --> 00:19:08,414
Here I come! Hyaa!

287
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:09,704

Speaking of, it's already winter?

Fast, isn't it? By the way,
what did you do last winter?

333
00:24:07,474 --> 00:24:09,744
Well, I had to prepare for
high school entrance exams...

334
00:24:09,744 --> 00:24:12,214
Oh, yeah. We studied for them
together, didn't we?

335
00:24:12,214 --> 00:24:15,654

I, Yutaka ended up teaching you...
