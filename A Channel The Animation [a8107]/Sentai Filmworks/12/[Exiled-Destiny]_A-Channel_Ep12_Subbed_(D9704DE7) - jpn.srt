00:00:01,694 --> 00:00:02,894
Bye-bye!

2
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:06,674
It's gone by so fast, huh?

3
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:09,274
I was thinking about how
you'd just entered our school,

4
00:00:09,274 --> 00:00:11,744
but you'll already be a second-year soon.

5
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:13,304
Yeah.

6
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:17,474
Then Run will be a third-year...

7
00:00:21,714 --> 00:00:23,014
See you.

8
00:00:23,654 --> 00:00:24,624
Yeah.

9
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:26,284
Bye-bye!

10
00:00:37,964 --> 00:00:39,734
Toru? You awake?

11
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:41,294
Yeah.

12
00:00:41,404 --> 00:00:44,774
It's the new semester today, right? Don't be late.

13
00:00:44,774 --> 00:00:45,744
Okay.

14
00:00:46,044 --> 00:00:47,634
I'll be back!

00:02:38,724 --> 00:02:40,054
Good morning, Nagi.

30
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:41,454
Hey.

31
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:48,734
What's the matter, Nagi?
You're not lookin' too spirited today.

32
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:53,034
I really got into a book yesterday,
and I was up late reading it.

33
00:02:53,334 --> 00:02:57,534
Oh, you didn't get enough sleep?
It's not good to stay up late.

34
00:02:57,774 --> 00:03:02,544
Actually, while I was doing that,
I ate two boxes of chocolates.

35
00:03:02,874 --> 00:03:04,544
I'm hating myself right now...

36
00:03:04,544 --> 00:03:06,914
She lost to the allure of sweets!

37
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:13,084
Th-the other day, I stayed up till morning
reading a book! It's called "On That Night."

38
00:03:13,354 --> 00:03:15,444
Oh, that one? You've read it?

39
00:03:15,694 --> 00:03:17,994
Yeah, it's a tear-jerker, right?

40
00:03:17,994 --> 00:03:21,364
When the boyfriend gets sick and dies,
did you cry like crazy, too?

41
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:29,094
I know, you get tears just rememberin' it, huh?

42
00:03:29,304 --> 00:03:30,364
I...

43
00:03:30,804 --> 00:03:31,774
On That Night

44
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:35,674
I only just started reading it!

45
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,544
I-I'm sorry!

46
00:03:39,244 --> 00:03:40,254
Huh?

47
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:42,304
You're doing your homework NOW?

48
00:03:43,314 --> 00:03:45,854
Yeah. I couldn't finish it yesterday.

49
00:03:45,854 --> 00:03:48,114
That's unusual.

50
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:50,954
I was up late reading a book.

51
00:03:52,924 --> 00:03:53,224
A

52
00:03:53,224 --> 00:03:55,094
A
This should be U.

53
00:03:55,594 --> 00:03:56,794
No, it's A.

54
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:03,674
This is I, right?

55
00:04:03,674 --> 00:04:06,474
Wrong. It's E.

56
00:04:08,574 --> 00:04:09,214
I.

57
00:04:09,214 --> 00:04:09,764
E.

58
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,184
What?

59
00:04:19,324 --> 00:04:20,314
Finished?

60
00:04:20,524 --> 00:04:22,994
A little more. Just a little more!

61
00:04:22,994 --> 00:04:24,454
Why you...

62
00:04:25,194 --> 00:04:27,224
This is 3, right?

63
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,594
It's E.

64
00:04:29,494 --> 00:04:31,964
So, this is MU, right?

65
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,224
It's 7.

66
00:04:34,404 --> 00:04:36,304
They're backwards and upside-down.

67
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,474
3 E MU 7

68
00:04:40,674 --> 00:04:41,474
Run-chan.

69
00:04:41,674 --> 00:04:43,244
You just do your homework?

70
00:04:43,244 --> 00:04:47,154
No! I finished it during vacation.

71
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,514
Run's talkin' to a boy.
Huh? But you were just copying it.

72
00:04:49,514 --> 00:04:50,014
Run's talkin' to a boy.
I was comparing answers with Nagi.

73
00:04:50,014 --> 00:04:51,654
Toru's gonna get mad again!
I was comparing answers with Nagi.

74
00:04:51,654 --> 00:04:52,344
I was comparing answers with Nagi.

75
00:04:53,054 --> 00:04:55,544
This is about when Toru gets here, right?

76
00:04:55,654 --> 00:04:58,624
Should I go to her and
do somethin' to pass the time?

77
00:04:58,724 --> 00:05:00,854
Or should I try to break things up?

78
00:05:08,734 --> 00:05:10,294
What's wrong, Yuko?

79
00:05:10,974 --> 00:05:12,204
English is hard, huh?

80
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:12,644
Run is still!
English is hard, huh?

81
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:13,834
Run is still!

82
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,544
S-say, Toru...

83
00:05:16,814 --> 00:05:18,044
What?

84
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:21,214
Right now, um... That is...

85
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:23,514
Let me in.

86
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,524
No!

87
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:27,784
Wh-what are you doing?

88
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,264
Now's no good! It's no good!

89
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:31,954
I can't breathe...

90
00:05:32,364 --> 00:05:34,334
Toru, you're here?

91
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:36,694
It's all right.

92
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:38,864
It's okay now, Toru.

93
00:05:40,904 --> 00:05:43,894
Huh? Toru?!

94
00:05:44,274 --> 00:05:49,334
All third-years, please ensure
you take proper care of yourselves.

95
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:52,234
First- and second-years,
remain dedicated to education-

96
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:54,074
Now listen up.

97
00:05:54,184 --> 00:05:58,114
If you aren't careful, this third semester
will be over before you know it.

98
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:01,214
Let's roll up our sleeves and do our best!

99
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:07,524
Hey, you there.

100
00:06:07,794 --> 00:06:09,854
Me, ma'am?

101
00:06:10,064 --> 00:06:13,594
That's right. Mind if I ask a favor?

102
00:06:14,034 --> 00:06:14,274
I'd like you to pass these out to everyone.

103

I'd like you to pass these out to everyone.

104
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,804
Okay. But first, a question.

105
00:06:20,244 --> 00:06:21,604
Hm? What is it?

106
00:06:22,774 --> 00:06:24,804
What is my name?

107
00:06:30,854 --> 00:06:33,284
Ma'am, don't tell me...

You're our homeroom teacher, correct?

110
00:06:35,154 --> 00:06:35,354
You're our homeroom teacher, correct?

111
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,194
Sorry!

112
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:40,754
When you're an adult, it's hard to recall things
off the top of your head, unfortunately.

113
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:44,924
Miss Kamate! That is unbecoming a teacher!

114
00:06:45,504 --> 00:06:46,734
Miss Kito!

115
00:06:46,734 --> 00:06:48,434
Huh? Why?

116
00:06:48,604 --> 00:06:51,274
Forgetting a student's name is unthinkable!

117
00:06:51,274 --> 00:06:56,674
I have completely memorized the faces, names,
year and homeroom of all students in school!

118
00:06:56,674 --> 00:06:58,414
Oh, that's awesome.

119
00:06:58,414 --> 00:07:00,754
It is only natural for a teacher!

120
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,684
You never know when
one of your precious students

121
00:07:02,684 --> 00:07:05,424
will come to you with a problem, do you?

122
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,854
At a time like that, you can't very well ask,
"Who are you again?" can...

123
00:07:06,854 --> 00:07:09,124
Kito. Kito. Kito!
At a time like that, you can't very well ask,
"Who are you again?" can...

124
00:07:11,294 --> 00:07:15,264
It's your fault she ran off,
so make up for it by taking these.

125
00:07:15,264 --> 00:07:17,634
Oh, and buy me dinner on the way home.

126
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:24,034
Thanks to you, Torun,
I finally finished my homework!

127
00:07:25,274 --> 00:07:27,244
So we weren't comparing answers?

128
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,784
I bet you hadn't done a single thing, had you?

129
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,974
Ooh, correct! How did you know?

130
00:07:34,084 --> 00:07:35,344
Why you...

131
00:07:35,654 --> 00:07:40,024
We're close to becoming second-years,
so pull yourself together.

132
00:07:40,224 --> 00:07:42,384
Great weather today, isn't it?

133
00:07:42,494 --> 00:07:43,954
Don't change the subject.

134
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,934
There's a kitty cat up there.

135
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:52,834
Maybe it can't get down.

136
00:07:56,304 --> 00:07:59,004
We can't leave it. I will help it!

137
00:07:59,274 --> 00:08:00,244
Yutaka?

138
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,274
Don't do that. It's dangerous!

139
00:08:04,414 --> 00:08:05,644
I'll be fine.

140
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:09,814
I may not look it, but I, Yutaka,
am great at climbing trees.

141
00:08:13,184 --> 00:08:15,984
Wait just a little longer. I'm coming.

142
00:08:16,524 --> 00:08:19,254
Please stay still...

143
00:08:22,894 --> 00:08:25,264
I've got you!

144
00:08:31,874 --> 00:08:33,734
U-Um...

145
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:37,374
They're both mad!

146
00:08:37,714 --> 00:08:41,214
I'm very sorry. I'll clean up the fallen leaves!

147
00:08:41,214 --> 00:08:43,084
That's not the point, is it?

148
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,324
What would you have done if you'd fallen?

149
00:08:47,324 --> 00:08:50,084
That's right! You could have gotten hurt!

150
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,924
Torun... Miporin...

151
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,134
What are you happy about?!

152
00:08:59,964 --> 00:09:02,464
Still, she did well, huh?

153
00:09:03,274 --> 00:09:05,604
I, Yutaka, did a good job, right?!

154
00:09:08,474 --> 00:09:12,934
I'm glad you're all right, kitty cat.

155
00:09:13,214 --> 00:09:15,544
No! Stop that! Hey!

156
00:09:15,654 --> 00:09:19,084
Don't lick me there!

00:09:28,164 --> 00:09:29,394
There you are!

00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:30,334

163
00:09:30,334 --> 00:09:32,134
Will it be a while longer?

164
00:09:32,634 --> 00:09:34,874
Are you all already done?

165
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,234
Yeah, we're done.

166
00:09:37,804 --> 00:09:38,864
Huh?

167
00:09:42,044 --> 00:09:46,144
Look! There are lots of leaves and bits
stuck in your hair!

168
00:09:49,184 --> 00:09:50,674
I'll get them for you.

169
00:09:51,084 --> 00:09:55,144
Y-you don't have to. I can do it myself.

170
00:09:55,224 --> 00:09:57,884
There's no need to be shy!

171
00:09:58,424 --> 00:09:58,664
Staaaaare...

00:09:58,664 --> 00:09:59,864

00:09:59,864 --> 00:10:00,194
Staaaaare...

174
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,624
Okay, it's all clean.

175
00:10:09,874 --> 00:10:12,564
Th-thank you.

176
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,044
What's wrong, Toru?

177
00:10:16,044 --> 00:10:18,374
Nothing, really.

178
00:10:18,614 --> 00:10:21,134

00:10:33,294 --> 00:10:35,494
Is something wrong, Toru?

181
00:10:36,264 --> 00:10:37,634
No.

182
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:40,004
It'll get cold if you don't hurry up and eat.

183
00:10:40,004 --> 00:10:40,694
Yeah.

184
00:10:46,944 --> 00:10:49,534
This durian burger is delicious!

185
00:10:49,744 --> 00:10:51,734
It's better than you'd think, huh?

186
00:10:53,544 --> 00:10:56,984
Toru! You've got some ketchup on you.
By your mouth.

187
00:10:58,354 --> 00:11:01,614
Oh, you're right. Thank you.

188
00:11:02,694 --> 00:11:05,524
Run-chan, you've got some, too. Here.

189
00:11:07,464 --> 00:11:09,554
I bit my tongue...

190
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:12,054
Is that blood? Or ketchup?!

191
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:14,324
Run. Toru.

192
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,204
Sorry to keep you waiting.

193
00:11:16,204 --> 00:11:18,504
Sorry we're late.

194
00:11:18,504 --> 00:11:23,964
Some foreign guy asked us for directions.
Somehow, we were able to answer...

195
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:28,084
Hahh huss haa heen huff!

196
00:11:28,614 --> 00:11:31,254
Huhh hunn hree huh he huh?

197
00:11:31,254 --> 00:11:31,944
Huh?

198
00:11:32,254 --> 00:11:35,714
What language is that? Is she testing me?

199
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:37,854
She just bit her tongue.

200
00:11:39,424 --> 00:11:40,834
Look, look!

201
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:45,564
I'm collectin' points. I want some
of this shop's merchandise!

202
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:47,704
Oh. This, huh?

203
00:11:47,704 --> 00:11:52,234
So if you all don't need yours,
you could help me out...

204
00:11:53,074 --> 00:11:54,164
Here you go.

205
00:11:54,374 --> 00:11:56,144
Thank you, Toru.

206
00:11:56,144 --> 00:11:57,784
Hoo han haa hine hoo!

207
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,244
Thank you too, Run.

208
00:11:59,484 --> 00:12:02,184
I'm not collecting them, so I'll pitch in.

209
00:12:02,184 --> 00:12:04,284
Really? I'm so happy!

210
00:12:04,284 --> 00:12:06,684
So, what are you collecting for?

211
00:12:07,624 --> 00:12:10,854
A keychain with a stuffed bear on it. It's cute!

212
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,294
Huho-hhan,

213
00:12:13,294 --> 00:12:15,664
Hi hinn ho hoo hike he hear hoo!

214
00:12:15,664 --> 00:12:17,254
Hi han hay hoo hun!

215
00:12:19,034 --> 00:12:23,694
Y-yeah. Um, I'm going to the bathroom for a bit.

216
00:12:23,974 --> 00:12:25,904
Okay.

217
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:28,204
So, how many more points does she need?

218
00:12:30,144 --> 00:12:31,844
Ow...

219
00:12:37,114 --> 00:12:39,684
Plain white is too ambitious. One point.

220
00:12:39,684 --> 00:12:42,094
But the lace is cute. Two points.

221
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,154
Hih haa hill? Hee hoi!

222
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:51,734
That man threw away his points!

223
00:12:55,334 --> 00:13:00,674
Aah, what a waste. But they're already
in the trash. I can't get them out from there.

224
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:05,914
That's it! If I stick around here, I might get some
from other people throwin' theirs away!

225
00:13:07,214 --> 00:13:08,844
Yuko sure is taking her time.

226
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:10,884
The heck is she doing?

227
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,114
Um...

228
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:16,584
I don't need my points,
so if you like, help yourself. Here.

229
00:13:16,824 --> 00:13:18,414
Hang hoo!

230
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,024
Thank you very much.

231
00:13:20,224 --> 00:13:21,824
Huh high hah!

232
00:13:22,194 --> 00:13:25,364
There might be a lot people
who aren't collecting points.

233
00:13:25,964 --> 00:13:28,574
At this rate, it won't be long
till we get that merchandise.

234
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,044
Yuko sure will be surprised when she gets back!

235
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:31,974
Um...

236
00:13:32,504 --> 00:13:34,474
Are you collecting point cards?

237
00:13:34,674 --> 00:13:35,804
Heh!
Yes!

238
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:40,974
Why?

239
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:44,374
Why isn't anyone throwin' their
point cards away?!

240
00:13:48,224 --> 00:13:50,124
For a limited time...

241
00:13:52,094 --> 00:13:56,894
It's a durian burger! For a limited time!
We HAVE to go eat one!

242
00:13:56,894 --> 00:13:58,134
Not today.

243
00:13:58,134 --> 00:14:00,034
Huh? Why not?

244
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,944
You have to do your homework, don't you?

245
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,274
It's for a limited time...

246
00:14:07,774 --> 00:14:08,934
Here you are.

247
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:10,174
Okay!

248
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:12,344
Please come again.

249
00:14:18,684 --> 00:14:19,854
How'd it go?

250
00:14:19,854 --> 00:14:21,344
I got it!

251
00:14:22,894 --> 00:14:25,154
I'm glad, Yuko-chan.

252
00:14:25,294 --> 00:14:27,324
Yeah. Thank you.

253
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,994
I sure was surprised, gettin' all those at once.

254
00:14:33,234 --> 00:14:34,534
Ta-daa!

255
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,604
Right? It's cute, huh?

256
00:14:38,174 --> 00:14:41,074
Yuko, you really like cute things, don't you?

257
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:45,014
Well, sure. Cute things are cute!

258
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:46,274
Finished!

259
00:14:47,684 --> 00:14:48,774
Look!

260
00:14:49,284 --> 00:14:50,144
What is it?

261
00:14:50,684 --> 00:14:51,984
A paper crane!

262
00:14:53,154 --> 00:14:54,694
Small, isn't it?

263
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,994
So small that I can't see it.

264
00:14:56,994 --> 00:14:59,424
You're cruel, Nagi-chan.

265
00:14:59,624 --> 00:15:01,324
Lend me your magnifying glass.

266
00:15:01,494 --> 00:15:03,434
I don't have that on me!

267
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:06,234
Huh? But that on your face...

268
00:15:06,234 --> 00:15:08,824
What the heck do you think GLASSES are?!

269
00:15:10,374 --> 00:15:11,464
Here.

270
00:15:11,574 --> 00:15:12,934
Thank you!

271
00:15:13,104 --> 00:15:15,044
You lent them to her, huh?

272
00:15:15,044 --> 00:15:16,534
Sure, why not?

273
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,874
Run. Is your head working?

274
00:15:21,814 --> 00:15:23,304
She's impersonating Nagi!

275
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:25,854
If you're not gonna use them,
then give them back!

276
00:15:25,854 --> 00:15:28,024
I thought you wanted something
in place of a magnifying glass.

277
00:15:28,024 --> 00:15:31,284
Huh? Well, fine.

278
00:15:32,194 --> 00:15:34,624
Nagi-chan, you're getting smaller!

279
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:38,194
Wow! So small...

280
00:15:38,434 --> 00:15:40,494
Yeah. Your eyes are.

281
00:15:42,134 --> 00:15:45,874
By the way, that impersonation
earlier was nothing like me.

282
00:15:45,874 --> 00:15:48,144
Huh? I don't know...

283
00:15:48,144 --> 00:15:49,914
You seem rather confident.

284
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:52,174
I wanna see it!

285
00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:55,074
Yeah, do it! An impersonation!

286
00:15:55,814 --> 00:15:58,374
I don't really want to show anyone, but...

287
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:03,954
Nagi-chan, those magnifying glasses suit you!

288
00:16:04,994 --> 00:16:05,724
Huh?

289
00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:08,294
WATCH, dammit!

290
00:16:08,294 --> 00:16:11,064
You said you didn't want to show us.

291
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:13,204
That's not what I meant!

292
00:16:13,204 --> 00:16:14,734
Okay then, one more time!

293
00:16:14,734 --> 00:16:16,564
I'd like to see it again, too.

294
00:16:17,134 --> 00:16:18,334
How could I do it NOW?!

295
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:21,104
Look, I'm watching this time.

296
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:22,264
Forget it!

297
00:16:25,344 --> 00:16:27,114
Nagi-chan's mad!

298
00:16:27,114 --> 00:16:29,844
Sorry. But Nagi, that was spot-on.

299
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:31,744
Yeah. Spot-on!

300
00:16:32,054 --> 00:16:33,984
You weren't looking, were you?!

301
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:42,764
How about this place?
They have a limited-time durian burger. See?

302
00:16:42,764 --> 00:16:47,534
Nah, no way. The students
come to places like these.

303
00:16:47,534 --> 00:16:50,634
Indeed. Because it's for a limited time.

304
00:16:51,374 --> 00:16:53,174
That won't do!

305
00:16:53,174 --> 00:16:56,474
Getting something to eat on the way home
from school is the first step toward delinquency!

306
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,544
We have to go warn them right-

307
00:16:58,544 --> 00:17:00,314
Aah, where's the harm?

308
00:17:00,314 --> 00:17:01,154
But!

309
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:02,984
So, we're goin' somewhere else.

310
00:17:02,984 --> 00:17:05,884
Yes, yes. You sure push people around, you?

311
00:17:05,954 --> 00:17:08,654
Please wait a moment! I'm not done-

312
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:12,824
The thing is, I'd like to go somewhere
fancy and more grown-up.

313
00:17:13,724 --> 00:17:17,734
Is that okay? Aah, that makes me happy.
You're treating, right?

314
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:18,834
Kito is.

315
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:20,354
Just a moment!

316
00:17:21,734 --> 00:17:24,294
We're splitting the bill!

317
00:17:26,104 --> 00:17:28,834
So that diet plan is all half-assed.

318
00:17:28,944 --> 00:17:29,804
It is?

319
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:31,904
Really? I believed in it, too.

320
00:17:32,114 --> 00:17:36,554
Right? That's why I was surprised.
So I switched to another one.

321
00:17:38,054 --> 00:17:39,554
It's okay to eat fries?

322
00:17:39,554 --> 00:17:40,524
Gah!

323
00:17:40,854 --> 00:17:43,684
For today, yes. I've done the math.

324
00:17:43,794 --> 00:17:44,984
Really?

325
00:17:47,994 --> 00:17:48,754
Toru?

326
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:51,434
Are you tired?

327
00:17:51,434 --> 00:17:53,064
I'm fine.

328
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,494
It's already this late?

329
00:17:55,604 --> 00:17:56,934
We talked too much, huh?

330
00:17:57,274 --> 00:17:58,844
Should we go ahead and go?

331
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,204
Yeah.

332
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,804
Yup. Let's go...

333
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:06,074
To space!

334
00:18:06,314 --> 00:18:08,314
You're saying something weird again?

335
00:18:08,314 --> 00:18:10,114
The truth is...

336
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:12,924
...I am an alien!

337
00:18:15,724 --> 00:18:17,554
Nagi's going to make fun of her again.

338
00:18:17,654 --> 00:18:18,954
I knew it!

339
00:18:19,524 --> 00:18:21,864
I thought that was the case.

340
00:18:21,864 --> 00:18:23,364
It makes sense!

341
00:18:23,364 --> 00:18:24,124
Huh?

342
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:26,434
No matter how much you eat, you don't get fat.

343
00:18:26,434 --> 00:18:27,464
You fly in the sky sometimes, right?

344
00:18:27,464 --> 00:18:28,404
You fly in the sky sometimes, right?
