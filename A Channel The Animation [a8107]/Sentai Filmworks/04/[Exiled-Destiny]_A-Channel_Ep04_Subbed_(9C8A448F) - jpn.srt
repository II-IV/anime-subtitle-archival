00:00:02,234 --> 00:00:04,134
See you later...

2
00:00:06,934 --> 00:00:08,974
Sleepy again this morning, aren't I?

3
00:00:08,974 --> 00:00:10,134
Yes, you are.

4
00:00:10,374 --> 00:00:13,744
Toru, you don't seem sleepy at all.

5
00:00:14,344 --> 00:00:16,504
I'm a morning person, so I'm fine.

6
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:22,484
Must be nice... I'm jealous.
I'm not a morning person.

7
00:00:23,214 --> 00:00:24,824
CAW CAW

8
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:25,944
CAW CAW
That's...

9
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:28,184
What's the matter, Run-chan?

10
00:00:28,824 --> 00:00:33,194
That bird's a little strange! What happened?

11
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:38,664
Say, Toru, that bird just keeps spinning around.
You think it's okay?

12
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:39,334
Run-chan, that's a weather vane.

13
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:41,304
WORRIED...
Run-chan, that's a weather vane.

14
00:00:41,304 --> 00:00:42,434
WORRIED...

15
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:57,354

29
00:02:30,144 --> 00:02:32,084
That straight, long hair!

30
00:02:33,484 --> 00:02:35,754
That tight, thin waist.

31
00:02:35,754 --> 00:02:38,184
Those arms, longer than a giraffe's neck!

32
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,554
Huh? I wonder if they're fighting...

33
00:02:41,054 --> 00:02:43,184
There've gotta be other, better things!

34
00:02:43,394 --> 00:02:45,194
Those long, slender legs!

35
00:02:45,194 --> 00:02:45,854
Huh?

36
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:47,154
Something better!

37
00:02:47,364 --> 00:02:48,934
Those full, E-cup breasts!

38
00:02:48,934 --> 00:02:49,534
Still not there!

39
00:02:49,534 --> 00:02:51,134
Skin as white as tofu!

40
00:02:51,134 --> 00:02:52,034
Still not there!

41
00:02:52,034 --> 00:02:52,234
Still, still, still, still, still, still,
still, still, still not there!

42
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:54,204
What's gotten into the two of you?
Still, still, still, still, still, still,
still, still, still not there!

43
00:02:54,204 --> 00:02:56,364
We're listing your strong points!
Still, still, still, still, still, still,
still, still, still not there!

44
00:02:57,004 --> 00:02:59,604
Wh-Why they talkin' about that?

45
00:02:59,604 --> 00:03:01,904
Pores that can only be confirmed
with a magnifying glass!

46
00:03:02,074 --> 00:03:03,874
A face as small as a water flea!

47
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,044
All this is just surface stuff.

48
00:03:08,514 --> 00:03:11,284
I wish they'd list some of my
INTERNAL qualities...

49
00:03:11,284 --> 00:03:12,354
More!

50
00:03:12,354 --> 00:03:13,374
Um...

51
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:15,384
She always dresses super nice!

52
00:03:17,094 --> 00:03:19,064
Plastic
Bottles

53
00:03:19,494 --> 00:03:21,554
Wh-what's the matter, Toru?

54
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,054
Run-chan...

55
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,564
Run-chan only praises YOU, Yuko.

56
00:03:27,534 --> 00:03:30,834
I took it too seriously
and ended up hanging myself...

57
00:03:31,104 --> 00:03:34,734
Come on. Toru, you got some
great qualities, too.

58
00:03:35,814 --> 00:03:36,574
For example.

59
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:40,254
Huh?! Um, well...

60
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:45,744
Oh! People go for f-flat chested!
Slender is in now, right?

61
00:03:45,924 --> 00:03:48,254
Toru, you're in the strike zone!

62
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:52,354
Huh?

63
00:03:54,694 --> 00:03:56,094
Wh-what?

64
00:04:00,804 --> 00:04:02,134
Stop that!

65
00:04:02,134 --> 00:04:04,204
You've got a nice body, so what?!

66
00:04:04,204 --> 00:04:07,234
She's like a model, isn't she? Yuko-chan...

67
00:04:08,074 --> 00:04:08,244
Danger!

68
00:04:08,244 --> 00:04:09,644
Danger!
I forgot!

69
00:04:09,644 --> 00:04:09,874
Danger!

70
00:04:11,744 --> 00:04:16,084
This year's goal: To lose three kilograms
by summer and get a model's body!

71
00:04:17,054 --> 00:04:19,644
Wait. There's still time.

72
00:04:19,754 --> 00:04:22,314
Summer doesn't really begin till August.

73
00:04:22,424 --> 00:04:24,684
Our high-school girls' summer hasn't begun!

74
00:04:25,624 --> 00:04:27,224
I still have a month.

75
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,624
With one month, I can make it work!

76
00:04:35,704 --> 00:04:37,174
School-wide
Beautification

77
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:38,104
POOL

78
00:04:40,974 --> 00:04:42,914
I'm done for.

79
00:04:43,214 --> 00:04:48,414
I forgot again: our high-school girls'
summer starts TODAY.

80
00:04:50,984 --> 00:04:56,154
Havin' to wear our swimsuits
just to clean the pool is such a pain!

81
00:05:01,494 --> 00:05:07,094
But cleaning in our swimsuits sounds like fun.
You think so too, right, Nagi?

82
00:05:08,604 --> 00:05:10,404
What's the matter, Nagi?

83
00:05:10,404 --> 00:05:12,844
N-nothing at all.

84
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:19,774
So tight!

85
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:23,614
Don't tell me I gained weight! No, it can't be.

86
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:25,554
I wonder if our swimsuits shrink...

87
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,824
It's a little tight.

88
00:05:27,824 --> 00:05:30,764
Well, we're still growing. In different ways!

89
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,924
Stop that! Jeez.

90
00:05:33,194 --> 00:05:36,354
Oh! My swimsuit shrank!

91
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:41,174
Ain't Nagi a little strange today?

92
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,904
Huh? She's the same as always.

93
00:05:46,444 --> 00:05:48,034
* IN CHARGE *

NO~

94
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:01,244
Toru-san.

95
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,224
You getting along?

96
00:06:04,524 --> 00:06:06,024
You're Yutaka's friend...

97
00:06:06,024 --> 00:06:07,724
Just call me "Miho".

98
00:06:08,794 --> 00:06:13,394
The truth is, like Yutaka,
I'm a fan of yours, Toru-san.

99
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:15,634
"Fan"?

100
00:06:15,634 --> 00:06:16,874
So...

101
00:06:16,874 --> 00:06:22,574
I haven't had a chance to ask before now,
but something's been bugging me...

102
00:06:27,084 --> 00:06:30,744
It's so soft! Is it natural? A hairdo?

103
00:06:31,484 --> 00:06:32,684
It's natural.

104
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,784
Toru!

105
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:42,034
Miporin, how rude! You're being a burden
to Toru as well, aren't you?!

106
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:45,164
I'm not following her around like Yutaka.

107
00:06:45,164 --> 00:06:48,194
It's not fair if it's just you, Miporin.
Yutaka has to touch, too!

108
00:06:48,704 --> 00:06:49,564
Grab!

109
00:06:52,404 --> 00:06:53,744
Why you...

110
00:06:53,744 --> 00:06:56,304
Torun! Torun!

111
00:06:56,544 --> 00:07:00,534
Say, you two get along well.
You went to the same middle school?

112
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:04,654
Yes. It wasn't the best of friendships, though.

113
00:07:07,924 --> 00:07:10,584
She's been pretty concerned about the time...

114
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:13,494
Okay, it's been three minutes.

115
00:07:13,494 --> 00:07:16,134
Please get away from Toru-san now, Yutaka.

116
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:18,224
Huh, already?

117
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:21,574
Miporin, you're so cruel!

118
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:26,594
I'm used to her, so if Yutaka starts
bothering you, feel free to ask me about it.

119
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:32,584
Speaking of middle school, Miporin's
nickname back then was "remote control".

120
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:33,844
Pretty uncool, huh?

121
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:36,354
Do you know WHYIwas called that?

122
00:07:36,354 --> 00:07:38,114
Not a clue!

123
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,584
Yutaka!

124
00:07:42,794 --> 00:07:45,064
Uh, sorry. Yeah. Very sorry.

125
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:45,994
Well, I'm just glad you get it.
Uh, sorry. Yeah. Very sorry.

126
00:07:45,994 --> 00:07:47,294
Well, I'm just glad you get it.
Very sorry.

127
00:07:47,294 --> 00:07:47,534
Very sorry.

128
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,794
But, in touching Torun's hair,
I, Yutaka, was also quite-

129
00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:53,004
Toru-san, I'll hold that trash bag.

130
00:07:53,004 --> 00:07:55,094
No! I, Yutaka, will hold it!

131
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,074
Well, thanks very much.

132
00:08:00,244 --> 00:08:03,374
W-wait! This is heavy!

133
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:04,384
Miporin! S-So heavy!

134
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:05,974
The remote control...
Miporin! S-So heavy!

135
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,344
The sun, shining down upon us...

136
00:08:11,184 --> 00:08:12,674
The poolside!

137
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,124
Like being at a resort?

138
00:08:20,564 --> 00:08:22,034
Nope.

139
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:29,034
It's too hot!

140
00:08:29,604 --> 00:08:32,364
It sure is hot in the pool, huh?

141
00:08:32,644 --> 00:08:36,874
Yeah, well, the sun's heat
has nowhere else to go.

142
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:45,874
In any case, let's get this done fast! Hyaa!

143
00:08:46,454 --> 00:08:47,254
Look out!

144
00:08:47,254 --> 00:08:47,394
THP!!
Look out!

145
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:48,224
THP!!

146
00:08:56,264 --> 00:08:57,604
Whatcha think she's doin'?

147
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:58,864
Beats me.

148
00:08:59,034 --> 00:09:02,524
Yuko-chan! Nagi-chan! It's all slippery here!

149
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,104
She's right.

150
00:09:13,014 --> 00:09:17,684
That's dangerous.
What if you fall and hit your head?

151
00:09:17,684 --> 00:09:20,674
I'll be fine. Whee!

152
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,344
Jeez...

153
00:09:23,494 --> 00:09:25,484
Nagi, you say somethin', too. Huh?

154
00:09:34,304 --> 00:09:35,664
Nagi!

155
00:09:36,874 --> 00:09:38,344
What?!

156
00:09:38,774 --> 00:09:40,794
Yuko-chan, gotcha!

157
00:09:42,314 --> 00:09:43,644
You're all wet!

158
00:09:44,414 --> 00:09:47,314
I see. It's come to this, eh?

159
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:49,974
Run!

160
00:09:51,454 --> 00:09:52,514
Gotcha!

161
00:09:53,624 --> 00:09:54,554
Hey!

162
00:09:54,554 --> 00:09:55,854
Hyaa!

163
00:09:56,624 --> 00:10:01,364
Mizushibuki kakatta, pichapichapi tte
Caught in a spray of water, going splash splash

164
00:10:01,364 --> 00:10:02,864
Marude tokonatsu poolside, kirakira kagayaku sora
Just like the poolside in an endless summer

165
00:10:02,864 --> 00:10:04,704
Ow...
Marude tokonatsu poolside, kirakira kagayaku sora
Just like the poolside in an endless summer

166
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:05,134
Marude tokonatsu poolside, kirakira kagayaku sora
Just like the poolside in an endless summer

167
00:10:05,134 --> 00:10:09,004
Marude tokonatsu poolside, kirakira kagayaku sora
The sky sparkling

168
00:10:09,604 --> 00:10:16,144
onna no ko minna asebamu hada, mizugi datte ka na?
All the girls' skin is sweaty, and their swimsuits, maybe?

169
00:10:16,144 --> 00:10:18,244
Borderline

170
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:21,784
Mujaki ni asonde hoshii
I want you to play innocently

171
00:10:21,784 --> 00:10:26,984
Bishonure ga sukisugite, kodomo mitai
You like being soaking wet too much, like a child

Itsuka yume mita rakuen wa resort kibun, kimi to nara
That paradise I saw in a dream once feels like a resort

173
00:10:33,094 --> 00:10:35,694
Itsuka yume mita rakuen wa resort kibun, kimi to nara
If I'm with you

174
00:10:35,694 --> 00:10:39,204
Senobi shite mita, himitsu
I tried stretching, it's a secret

175
00:10:39,204 --> 00:10:42,504
Fui ni shirimochi o tsuichatte, tsururi, doji na mainichi sa
And accidentally fell on my butt, SLIP!

176
00:10:42,504 --> 00:10:46,374
Fui ni shirimochi o tsuichatte, tsururi, doji na mainichi sa
Every day was clumsy

177
00:10:48,674 --> 00:10:53,644
Naitari, warattari shinagara ne
While crying and laughing, right?

178
00:10:53,644 --> 00:10:57,954
Itazura shitemo nakayoshi sa
Even if you play pranks, we're still friends

179
00:10:57,954 --> 00:11:05,584
Dokidoki de love na shunkan wa minna no takaramono
That heart-pumping moment of love is everyone's treasure

180
00:11:06,194 --> 00:11:12,764
Subesube ano ko no ohada ni wa jikken shite miru
I'm gonna try an experiment on that girl's soft skin

181
00:11:12,764 --> 00:11:15,334
Splash water on it
Mizu kakete

182
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:15,404
Take this, and this, and this!
Splash water on it
Mizu kakete

183
00:11:15,404 --> 00:11:17,274
Take this, and this, and this!
Pichipichi ni hajiite kurechau, dakishimetai
Splish, it repelled it, I want to hug her, that still-wet girl

184
00:11:17,274 --> 00:11:20,914
Pichipichi ni hajiite kurechau, dakishimetai
Splish, it repelled it, I want to hug her, that still-wet girl

185
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:25,904
Nureta mama no girl
Splish, it repelled it, I want to hug her, that still-wet girl

186
00:11:34,024 --> 00:11:36,424
Um, Torun, what are you looking at?

187
00:11:38,624 --> 00:11:39,394
Gotcha!

188
00:11:45,864 --> 00:11:47,354
Paradise...

189
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,774
This ain't paradise at all!

190
00:11:51,804 --> 00:11:55,434
WORKING
OVERTIME
BECAUSE
IT'S NOT
DONE

191
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,204
I'm home.

192
00:12:15,294 --> 00:12:16,884
So tired...

193
00:12:18,064 --> 00:12:21,334
I should've put on more sunscreen.

194
00:12:26,074 --> 00:12:27,574
It's all right.

195
00:12:27,574 --> 00:12:32,014
I did that much physical activity today.
It's sure to have gone down.

196
00:12:32,114 --> 00:12:39,574
No, I might even have reached my goal
of losing three kilograms. Get a clue, scale!

197
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,664
1 kg UP

198
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:04,074
Come to think of it, without my clothes on,
it should be minus 1 kg.

199
00:13:04,414 --> 00:13:09,784
Oh, so there was no change.
That was a waste to even worry about it!

200
00:13:10,984 --> 00:13:12,644
Basic Dieting
Knowledge

201
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:16,214
First, you have to make a one-month plan, huh?

202
00:13:16,454 --> 00:13:19,864
The basics are exercise
and cutting back on food.

203
00:13:20,324 --> 00:13:22,734
And no eating between meals.

204
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:29,364
Dinner should be early, and light,
using mainly vegetables and with no oil.

205
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:37,874
"Let's exercise daily; jogging, jump rope,
stretching and so on are effective."

206
00:13:39,684 --> 00:13:42,204
Man, this is sadistic!

207
00:13:44,084 --> 00:13:45,554
That was delicious.

208
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:54,924
I think I'll keep it a secret from everyone that
I've started a diet. I bet they'd make a fuss.

209
00:13:55,264 --> 00:13:56,524
If Run knew...

210
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,934
Stop, it'll be bad for your health!

211
00:14:02,774 --> 00:14:03,894
Yuko would be...

212
00:14:04,304 --> 00:14:07,294
You're fine the way you are now.
You're plenty good!

213
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,464
Yeah, that sounds like her!

214
00:14:14,284 --> 00:14:15,514
Toru would be...

215
00:14:15,984 --> 00:14:16,084
Aah, delish!

216
00:14:16,084 --> 00:14:18,084
CHOMP CHOMP
CRUNCH Greasy
Potato Chips CRUNCH
Aah, delish!

217
00:14:18,084 --> 00:14:18,524
CHOMP CHOMP
CRUNCH Greasy
Potato Chips CRUNCH

218
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,354
CHOMP CHOMP
CRUNCH Greasy
Potato Chips CRUNCH
Want some? Have as many as you like.

219
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:24,754
Just imagining that makes me want to eat some!

220
00:14:28,894 --> 00:14:30,024
Nagi.

221
00:14:30,464 --> 00:14:36,134
I was unexpectedly taken aback!
Toru's a sharp one, so I have to be careful.

222
00:14:36,134 --> 00:14:37,534
Hey, what's up?

223
00:14:38,674 --> 00:14:39,534
Diet.

224
00:14:39,844 --> 00:14:41,174
Huh?

225
00:14:41,174 --> 00:14:42,744
Wh-what?

226
00:14:42,744 --> 00:14:45,074
You're on a diet, aren't you?

227
00:14:53,084 --> 00:14:55,574
Wh-what does this mean?

228
00:14:58,524 --> 00:14:59,894
Where are Run and Yuko?

229
00:14:59,994 --> 00:15:01,584
They just went to the bathroom.

230
00:15:03,134 --> 00:15:04,864
How did you know?

231
00:15:04,864 --> 00:15:06,404
Last spring, it was you who said

232
00:15:06,404 --> 00:15:10,034
"Dieting until summer and losing three kilograms
is a piece of cake," right?

233
00:15:10,274 --> 00:15:12,264
You remembered that yesterday, didn't you?

234
00:15:13,004 --> 00:15:16,104
Just forget trivial things like that!

235
00:15:17,944 --> 00:15:19,514
Are you going to tell everyone?

236
00:15:19,514 --> 00:15:20,744
No, I won't.

237
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:24,284
Huh? Don't tell me, you want money
to keep your mouth shut!

238
00:15:25,084 --> 00:15:26,284
I don't need that.

239
00:15:32,194 --> 00:15:33,924
What are you doing?

240
00:15:37,234 --> 00:15:38,594
They're not here.

241
00:15:39,734 --> 00:15:43,104
Toru, you eat so much junk food
but you're still skinny, huh?

242
00:15:43,334 --> 00:15:45,874
Because I run around the place, maybe?

243
00:15:45,874 --> 00:15:48,934
On the other hand,
THESE don't get any nourishment.

244
00:15:49,374 --> 00:15:52,544
Oh. They say they'll shrink
if they bounce around, huh?

245
00:15:53,084 --> 00:15:58,344
Then I can't go jogging or do jump rope
because my boobs will go away, huh? All right!

246
00:15:59,884 --> 00:16:06,454
If it bothers you that much, why not ask Yuko?
She may be working very hard at it.

247
00:16:07,964 --> 00:16:11,954
There must be something,
some secret to that nice body.

248
00:16:12,334 --> 00:16:16,234
Oh. Yeah, that's true. All right!

249
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,444
They're not here, either?

250
00:16:20,574 --> 00:16:23,204
Maybe we passed each other somewhere.

251
00:16:25,044 --> 00:16:27,244
Toru, you're sweating.

252
00:16:27,244 --> 00:16:30,854
These are tears of sadness
at not seeing Run-chan.

253
00:16:30,854 --> 00:16:34,794
Don't push yourself. You've gotten hot
walking around, haven't you?

254
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:35,844
I'm not hot.

255
00:16:36,054 --> 00:16:40,364
In any case, why are you still wearing long
sleeves even though it's already summer?

256
00:16:40,364 --> 00:16:42,884
I want my arms to show as little as possible.

257
00:16:44,464 --> 00:16:47,594
You're gonna have a heatstroke, so take this off!

258
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:50,794
Are you THAT against it?

259
00:16:51,674 --> 00:16:55,444
Okay, open your textbooks to page 52.

260
00:17:03,184 --> 00:17:06,884
Huh? Am I doin' something to keep my figure?

261
00:17:06,884 --> 00:17:11,264
There's no real reason.
I just kinda wanted to ask.

262
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:14,534
Yeah, well...

263
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:18,904
Eating whatever I want and getting
a good night's rest, I guess.

264
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,594
Oh, guess I ain't doing anything.

265
00:17:20,804 --> 00:17:24,904
Are you a model or something?!
Don't screw with us! You're no use at all!

266
00:17:24,904 --> 00:17:27,344
Wh-what?

267
00:17:27,344 --> 00:17:29,034
Keeping her figure?

268
00:17:29,344 --> 00:17:31,274
You're talking about a diet?

269
00:17:32,144 --> 00:17:37,454
Oh, you're talkin' about a diet.
Nagi, did you start dieting?

270
00:17:37,454 --> 00:17:42,324
Well, yeah. I guess the cat's out of the bag now.

271
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,664
Run, you ever dieted before?

272
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:49,964
Not formally, I think.
I don't want to limit what I eat.

273
00:17:49,964 --> 00:17:51,934
You haven't either, right, Yuko-chan?

274
00:17:51,934 --> 00:17:53,904
Yeah. I haven't. Why?

275
00:17:53,904 --> 00:17:56,904
Because, you have a pet, right?

276
00:17:56,904 --> 00:17:58,774
A pet? What do you mean?

277
00:17:58,774 --> 00:18:02,234
What was it, it sounded like something else...

278
00:18:02,774 --> 00:18:04,044
A tapeworm!

279
00:18:05,014 --> 00:18:05,214
CLENCH

280
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:05,544
CLENCH
Thanks to the power of tapeworm, right?

281
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:07,544
Thanks to the power of tapeworm, right?

282
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,074
I don't have that, and it ain't a pet!

283
00:18:10,854 --> 00:18:12,084
The computer.

284
00:18:13,284 --> 00:18:16,794
If you look on the Net,
you'll find a good way to diet.

285
00:18:16,794 --> 00:18:18,084
Oh, really?

286
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:24,084
Why here, in the library?
The one in the classroom is just fine.

287
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:28,134
Using the classroom's computer is a little...

288
00:18:28,134 --> 00:18:28,804
Diets speedy weight loss

289
00:18:28,804 --> 00:18:31,574
Diets speedy weight loss
There's lots of different diets, huh?

290
00:18:31,574 --> 00:18:32,274
Diets speedy weight loss

291
00:18:32,274 --> 00:18:32,874
I took this and lost 60 kg!!

292
00:18:32,874 --> 00:18:33,144
I took this and lost 60 kg!!
Slim Magnum EX
New Product!!

293
00:18:33,144 --> 00:18:37,474
I took this and lost 60 kg!!
Slim Magnum EX
New Product!!
"I took this and lost 60 kilograms," it says!

294
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:39,914
I took this and lost 60 kg!!
Slim Magnum EX
New Product!!
That's too much, right? Sounds fishy.

295
00:18:40,144 --> 00:18:43,954
If you lost that much,
your weight would be minus.

296
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:46,354
You could fly up in the sky, huh?

297
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:47,654
Yeah.

298
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:50,024
I'd be ethereal.

299
00:18:50,994 --> 00:18:52,194
DELICIOUS
MILK

300
00:18:52,194 --> 00:18:53,354
DELICIOUS
MILK
That's it for me.

301
00:18:54,194 --> 00:18:56,194
Nagi-chan, you're done already?

302
00:18:56,194 --> 00:19:00,224
Yeah. Cutting back on food
is the basis of dieting.

303
00:19:00,464 --> 00:19:02,834
You can't push yourself too far, Nagi.

304
00:19:05,504 --> 00:19:10,104
Nah, I'm fine! That was just enough for me.

305
00:19:12,414 --> 00:19:14,004
You're pushing yourself.

306
00:19:14,514 --> 00:19:17,504
Th-that didn't happen! You never heard it!

307
00:19:17,854 --> 00:19:20,444
No, it's no good. We DID hear it!

308
00:19:20,554 --> 00:19:22,454
Just forget it!

309
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:32,364
Sure enough, I get hungry around this time.

310
00:19:33,134 --> 00:19:34,874
Say, Nagi...

311
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:39,674
Suddenly chargin' into a diet isn't good
for your body, so you should quit.

312
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:45,244
You should go slower. You can make
your goal by next year, right?

313
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:52,074
That's right, Nagi-chan. Let's take it slow!

314
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:59,224
Yeah. Guess I can't force it, huh?
I'll calm down, take things at my own pace.

315
00:20:00,394 --> 00:20:03,154
Oh, hey, wanna go eat some ice cream?

316
00:20:03,394 --> 00:20:04,734
Yeah, nice!

317
00:20:04,734 --> 00:20:08,974
Hang on a minute! Isn't ice cream a bit strange,
considering what we were just talking about?!

318
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:12,064
I want chocolate chip and strawberry.

319
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:15,914
Vanilla and cheese and yogurt...

320
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,434
They're all white, huh?

321
00:20:17,644 --> 00:20:18,484
Now look here!

322
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:23,114
As for me, I think I'll do mint and raspberry.
And you, Nagi?

323
00:20:31,124 --> 00:20:32,524
Rum raisin.

324
00:20:36,994 --> 00:20:39,334
Dieting's out of the question for a while, huh?

325
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:41,724
Come on. Let's go, Nagi!

326
00:20:42,334 --> 00:20:43,964
Hey, hold on!

327
00:20:45,774 --> 00:20:47,934
You're fine the way you are.

328
00:20:50,244 --> 00:20:52,544
You're plenty good.

329
00:20:53,314 --> 00:20:55,044
And plenty cute.

330
00:20:57,014 --> 00:21:00,384
Why'd you go and say somethin'
embarrassing like that?!

331
00:21:01,924 --> 00:21:03,194
Wait up, Yuko!

332
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:04,954
Come on, hurry!

333
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,854
Wait, I said!

334
00:21:21,744 --> 00:21:23,374
Check this out...

335
00:21:23,514 --> 00:21:24,944
New socks!

336
00:21:25,014 --> 00:21:28,984
Ah! They're fluorescent yellow!
They sure stand out.

337
00:21:28,984 --> 00:21:30,154
Nice, huh?

338
00:21:30,154 --> 00:21:31,444
Good morning!

339
00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:32,844
Good morning.

340
00:21:33,684 --> 00:21:35,024
Toru!

341
00:21:35,024 --> 00:21:36,124
Why are you wearing loose socks?!
They're out of date!

342
00:21:36,124 --> 00:21:38,324
Note: Big, leg warmer-looking socks that were all the rage in the late '90s.

No, these are new knee-length socks.
She said they slide easily, though.

346
00:21:43,164 --> 00:21:44,824
Just how the hell skinny are you?

347
00:21:54,374 --> 00:21:57,244
I used Stopper, but they still fall.

348
00:21:57,244 --> 00:21:59,184
Wanna use Soft Touch?

349
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:00,204
Yes.

350
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,114
I want to gain a little weight.

351
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:05,784
I just heard something that I can't ignore!

352
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:07,114
No, it was nothing...

353
00:22:07,554 --> 00:22:09,314
Okay, finished.

354
00:22:09,824 --> 00:22:10,884
Thank you.

355
00:22:18,864 --> 00:22:20,164
I want to gain weight.

Okay, now it's TRULY summer!

371
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:01,134
And summer means the pool! And the beach!

372
00:24:01,134 --> 00:24:02,574
It's here: the beach!

373
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:06,674
And the beach means sporty girls in their bikinis!
Ooh, I can't take it!

374
00:24:06,674 --> 00:24:08,674
Are you really a high-school girl?

375
00:24:08,674 --> 00:24:12,344
I think everyone is VERY interested
in seeing I, Yutaka, in a swimsuit.

376
00:24:12,344 --> 00:24:13,784
No, I don't think so.
