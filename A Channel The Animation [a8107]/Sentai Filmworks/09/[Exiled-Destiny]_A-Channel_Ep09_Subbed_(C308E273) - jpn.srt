1
00:00:05,064 --> 00:00:06,464
Good morning, Nagi.

2
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:07,664
Good morning.

3
00:00:09,474 --> 00:00:12,004
Wow, it suddenly got cold, huh?

4
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:14,204
Well, it IS the end of October.

5
00:00:15,744 --> 00:00:16,914
Oh. Halloween.

6
00:00:16,914 --> 00:00:22,584
Yeah. Come to think of it, you see lots of
Halloween decorations around now, huh?

7
00:00:22,584 --> 00:00:27,614
Sure do. I feel like recently,
it's suddenly taken root here in Japan.

8
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:29,624
Yeah, true enough.

9
00:00:30,124 --> 00:00:31,614
You're not scared?

10
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:35,054
Huh?

11
00:00:36,264 --> 00:00:37,494
Nagi?

12
00:00:38,904 --> 00:00:41,564
Halloween means MONSTERS, doesn't it?

13
00:00:43,804 --> 00:00:45,534
That's not scary?

14
00:00:46,044 --> 00:00:50,634
No, it ain't scary. Halloween's
not about real monsters.

15
00:00:51,444 --> 00:00:55,114
I have a little trouble
with scary stories, but that's it.

16
00:00:55,314 --> 00:00:57,284
A "little," huh?

17
00:00:58,424 --> 00:01:00,014
Just a little!

18
00:01:00,624 --> 00:01:03,524
You have things like that, don't you?

19
00:01:03,894 --> 00:01:06,414
No, I can't think of anything.

20
00:01:06,764 --> 00:01:08,294
GOOD MORNING!

21
00:01:08,294 --> 00:01:08,694
Aoigaoka
High School

22
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:09,964
Aoigaoka
High School
All right, give it your all!

23
00:01:09,964 --> 00:01:10,864
All right, give it your all!

24
00:01:12,164 --> 00:01:13,574
G-good morning.

25
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,134
Yes, good morning!

26
00:01:15,134 --> 00:01:16,364
Good morning.

27
00:01:17,104 --> 00:01:18,874
GOOD MORNING!

28
00:01:19,444 --> 00:01:21,244
Nothing gives you trouble, right?

29
00:01:21,244 --> 00:01:22,974
Has trouble with
enthusiasm

30
00:01:23,514 --> 00:01:26,004
Let's all do our best today!

31
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:29,684
Well, I have trouble with that, too...

32
00:01:29,914 --> 00:01:31,404
GOOD MORNING!

33
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:46,804
Cloudy and ephemeral

34
00:01:46,804 --> 00:01:55,544
Becoming one with the glittering, faraway sky

35
00:01:55,544 --> 00:02:03,644
My wind-reading, willful destination is far away

36
00:02:04,184 --> 00:02:07,324
Let's go together

37
00:02:07,324 --> 00:02:13,024
I'll inhale deeply and go, the world's spring breath

38
00:02:13,294 --> 00:02:18,424
The smiling faces of everyone gathered in the sun

39
00:02:19,134 --> 00:02:25,874
In between "Good morning" and
"Goodbye," there is only us

40
00:02:25,874 --> 00:02:29,434
We can do anything, can't we?

41
00:02:29,814 --> 00:02:35,544
Transparent beams of sunlight, a newborn sky

42
00:02:35,754 --> 00:02:41,654
A morning arch at which we promised to meet

43
00:02:41,654 --> 00:02:49,154
To you, waving your hand, I'll give a special today

44
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:52,564
And the talking will begin

45
00:03:01,914 --> 00:03:03,214
Toru Nagi
A-CHANNEL
Yuko
Run

46
00:03:03,214 --> 00:03:06,874
THE PRESENT

47
00:03:07,414 --> 00:03:10,314
Ah! Nagi-chan, Yuko-chan! Good morning!

48
00:03:10,984 --> 00:03:12,454
'Morning...

49
00:03:12,454 --> 00:03:16,354
Huh? The two of you look tired. What happened?

50
00:03:16,694 --> 00:03:19,924
Early-morning... enthusiasm...

51
00:03:20,464 --> 00:03:21,954
Nagi-chan?

52
00:03:22,394 --> 00:03:24,954
Everyone has somethin' that gives them trouble.

53
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,934
What is THIS?!

54
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:32,734
What's the matter?

55
00:03:33,444 --> 00:03:35,774
There's a creepy stuffed animal on my desk.

56
00:03:35,774 --> 00:03:38,444
Whoa, what is that? It's nasty!

57
00:03:38,444 --> 00:03:39,504
Right?

58
00:03:39,684 --> 00:03:44,674
Oh, is it for Halloween? A trick-or-treat thingy?

59
00:03:44,884 --> 00:03:49,684
A prank? Harassment? This sure seems like it.

60
00:03:49,894 --> 00:03:51,914
Shouldn't you just throw it away?

61
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:54,424
But then I could be cursed!

62
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:54,794
What should I do? I can't say
it was ME who made it...

63
00:03:54,794 --> 00:03:57,334
Yeah, sure enough. A curse would be scary!
What should I do? I can't say
it was ME who made it...

64
00:03:57,334 --> 00:03:57,634
What should I do? I can't say
it was ME who made it...

65
00:03:57,634 --> 00:03:58,494
Right?
What should I do? I can't say
it was ME who made it...

66
00:03:59,504 --> 00:04:02,334
Huh? Run, YOU made that stuffed doll?

67
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:04,604
Sorry we said such nasty things.

68
00:04:04,674 --> 00:04:06,804
No, that's fine.

69
00:04:06,804 --> 00:04:11,184
I heard that you like them,
so I tried hard to make one, but...

70
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:15,484
Animals are hard, huh?
It doesn't look like one, huh?

71
00:04:15,654 --> 00:04:17,724
No, it's really good!

72
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:18,884
Yeah, yeah!

73
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,754
Especially this, um...

74
00:04:20,754 --> 00:04:23,194
Ear-looking thing.

75
00:04:23,194 --> 00:04:24,624
Wait, is it a horn?

76
00:04:24,624 --> 00:04:26,114
And this bulging eye...

77
00:04:26,424 --> 00:04:29,724
I mean, googly eye...

78
00:04:30,034 --> 00:04:31,794
Oh, this mouth!

79
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:35,334
The way it opens is so distinctive, huh?

80
00:04:35,534 --> 00:04:37,834
Yeah! It really looks like it!

81
00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:42,804
Um, I said I like this?

82
00:04:43,174 --> 00:04:44,844
What could it be?

83
00:04:44,844 --> 00:04:46,714
I wonder if it looks like it...

84
00:04:46,714 --> 00:04:48,184
Yeah.

85
00:04:49,684 --> 00:04:51,314
A Halloween party?

86
00:04:51,654 --> 00:04:53,244
Why all of a sudden?

87
00:04:53,384 --> 00:04:56,594
Some things happened this morning,
and we started talking about it.

88
00:04:56,594 --> 00:04:59,224
I've been interested in Halloween for a while.

89
00:04:59,224 --> 00:05:02,994
Tomorrow's Saturday,
so let's all make some sweets and eat them!

90
00:05:02,994 --> 00:05:04,934
I look forward to it!

91
00:05:05,134 --> 00:05:10,174
What kind of sweets should we do?
Cookies or something? Or cakes?

92
00:05:10,174 --> 00:05:11,704
I'll pass.

93
00:05:11,704 --> 00:05:12,844
Huh?

94
00:05:12,844 --> 00:05:15,474
Nagi, you don't like making sweets?

95
00:05:15,474 --> 00:05:20,784
It takes precise measurements and stuff.
That's not for me.

96
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:23,374
Also, I'm on a diet.

97
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,654
Don't worry about it.

98
00:05:25,654 --> 00:05:29,284
I'll measure out the calories for you, Nagi.

99
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,164
Really?

100
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,324
Yeah.

101
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,434
Well, if I only have to eat...

102
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,194
Okay!

103
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:37,154
What about you, Toru?

104
00:05:38,634 --> 00:05:40,734
I think I'll be a little late.

105
00:05:40,734 --> 00:05:42,104
Oh.

106
00:05:42,104 --> 00:05:44,804
I'll come over and eat some once they're done.

107
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:46,104
Sure, okay!

108
00:05:46,104 --> 00:05:49,604
Oh, then I'll show up later with Toru.

109
00:05:49,944 --> 00:05:50,914
Okay.

110
00:05:51,144 --> 00:05:54,484
Well, Yuko-chan, want to make them with me?

111
00:05:54,484 --> 00:05:57,944
Sure. Is there anything I should bring over?

112
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:03,294
My mom makes sweets,
so I think we have just about everything.

113
00:06:03,294 --> 00:06:05,764
Oh. I'm lookin' forward to it!

114
00:06:05,924 --> 00:06:08,264
Okay, let's do it tomorrow!

115
00:06:08,364 --> 00:06:09,524
Yeah!

116
00:06:24,344 --> 00:06:26,334
Run, what are you drawing?

117
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:33,224
Look. Toru and I are exchanging diaries.
We're doing a drawing game!

118
00:06:37,094 --> 00:06:38,784
What does it look like?

119
00:06:39,494 --> 00:06:42,294
It's the "stuffed animal incident" again!

120
00:06:50,404 --> 00:06:54,774
Is that even an animal?
It looks kinda like a bug...

121
00:06:55,174 --> 00:06:57,544
Maybe it's a little difficult to tell.

122
00:06:58,444 --> 00:07:02,214
Okay, here's a hint: it's often eaten.

123
00:07:04,184 --> 00:07:05,674
People eat it?!

124
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:07,814
That was a big one.

125
00:07:08,254 --> 00:07:10,084
It's a zebra, isn't it?

126
00:07:10,694 --> 00:07:12,224
Toru, that's right!

127
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:12,884
Z...

128
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,424
A zebra...

129
00:07:16,494 --> 00:07:18,434
Great job, Toru!

130
00:07:18,904 --> 00:07:22,834
THIS is a zebra? Am I just dense?

131
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,774
Nagi, you're over-thinking it.

132
00:07:31,944 --> 00:07:35,884
I don't mind taking it, but this thing is a bit scary.

133
00:07:35,984 --> 00:07:38,184
You're not going home yet?

134
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,354
No, I'm going.

135
00:07:41,024 --> 00:07:45,164
Come to think of it, do you want to meet before
going to Run-chan's house tomorrow?

136
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,394
Yeah, that would help me out.

137
00:07:47,794 --> 00:07:51,804
So, the station's north exit,
near the entrance to the shopping arcade.

138
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:52,854
Okay.

139
00:07:55,874 --> 00:07:58,204
Toru! Th-that!

140
00:07:59,974 --> 00:08:02,744
This? I got it from Run-chan.

141
00:08:02,974 --> 00:08:04,884
Yes, I know!

142
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,144
Then, what?

143
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:11,284
What is it supposed to be?

144
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,384
You can't tell, Nagi?

145
00:08:20,564 --> 00:08:23,324
Why? This is really irritating!

146
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,364
The truth is, I got the same kind of thing.

147
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,464
It's so big!

148
00:08:33,374 --> 00:08:34,634
How cruel.

149
00:08:38,114 --> 00:08:40,014
Please, you MUST give me that!

150
00:08:40,014 --> 00:08:43,674
Huh? No way. This is mine.

151
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:45,454
Don't say that!

152
00:08:45,454 --> 00:08:46,554
No, no.

153
00:08:46,554 --> 00:08:48,054
You're cruel!

154
00:08:48,054 --> 00:08:49,524
It's not cruel at all.

155
00:08:50,024 --> 00:08:51,424
Sorry for the wait.

156
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,684
Well, shall we go?

157
00:08:54,064 --> 00:08:56,194
I'll get things ready, so wait for me, okay?

158
00:08:56,294 --> 00:08:58,564
Yeah. But hurry.

159
00:09:01,434 --> 00:09:02,924
By the way, Nagi...

160
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:06,274
What animal do you like?

161
00:09:06,274 --> 00:09:09,844
Huh? Don't tell me you're going to put it
into that drawing exchange with Run!

162
00:09:09,844 --> 00:09:11,374
No, that's not it.

163
00:09:11,544 --> 00:09:13,644
I just wanted to ask.

164
00:09:13,644 --> 00:09:20,384
Oh, really? Well... I like small, cute animals.

165
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:21,844
Like squirrels.

166
00:09:22,054 --> 00:09:24,584
Ah. Cute, aren't they? Squirrels.

167
00:09:25,894 --> 00:09:27,384
Oh, yeah. This.

168
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,424
I didn't say what it is, did I?

169
00:09:31,564 --> 00:09:32,764
You wanna know?
I'm all ready!

170
00:09:32,764 --> 00:09:33,164
Yes, I do! Come on, come on, come on!
I'm all ready!

171
00:09:33,164 --> 00:09:34,364
Yes, I do! Come on, come on, come on!

172
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,434
Please, tell me!

173
00:09:36,434 --> 00:09:38,044
They're cute, aren't they? Squirrels.

174
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,874
Come on, Toru!

175
00:09:39,874 --> 00:09:40,444
Small animals.

176
00:09:40,444 --> 00:09:41,274
What do you think they're talking about?

177
00:09:41,274 --> 00:09:42,444
Tell me!
What do you think they're talking about?

178
00:09:42,444 --> 00:09:44,034
Tell me!
Beats me.

179
00:09:45,744 --> 00:09:47,074
I'm home.

180
00:10:03,694 --> 00:10:05,594
Yup, this is scary.

181
00:10:21,314 --> 00:10:22,304
This way?

182
00:10:23,484 --> 00:10:24,954
Trick or treat!

183
00:10:25,184 --> 00:10:26,424
Here you go.

184
00:10:26,424 --> 00:10:27,724
Thank you!

185
00:10:27,724 --> 00:10:30,854
Sure enough, all these stores
are decked out for Halloween.

186
00:10:31,094 --> 00:10:35,254
So, our meeting place should be around here...

187
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,194
We said "Trick or treat," didn't we?!

188
00:10:38,864 --> 00:10:40,234
Ah. Nagi.

189
00:10:40,234 --> 00:10:41,674
Candy!

190
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:42,834
Hand it over!

191
00:10:44,874 --> 00:10:47,604
I told them I didn't work there, but those kids...

192
00:10:48,344 --> 00:10:50,534
I don't have any candy, either.

193
00:10:50,744 --> 00:10:51,544
So...

194
00:10:54,284 --> 00:10:56,354
Toru, don't tell me those
are your normal clothes!

195
00:10:56,354 --> 00:10:57,824
Halloween
Fair
Toru, don't tell me those
are your normal clothes!

196
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:01,924
Halloween
Fair

197
00:11:01,924 --> 00:11:02,354
Halloween
Fair
Huh?

198
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:02,824
Huh?

199
00:11:02,824 --> 00:11:06,314
We go through this shopping arcade
to go to Run's house?

200
00:11:06,494 --> 00:11:07,764
Your first time?

201
00:11:07,764 --> 00:11:12,634
Yeah. I think we took a different route
to get there last time.

202
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:17,324
Correct. This way is a little roundabout. Listen...

203
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:22,304
Run-chan said she'd be making sweets.
So we'll bring backup sweets.

204
00:11:22,544 --> 00:11:24,814
Oh, we're here to buy them?

205
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:26,874
Wait, you're assuming she'll mess up?!

206
00:11:27,714 --> 00:11:29,244
Oh, Toru-chan!

207
00:11:30,854 --> 00:11:31,924
Good afternoon.

208
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,544
You're looking well.

209
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:35,424
Here. Take this

210
00:11:35,424 --> 00:11:37,094
VINEGARED
SQUID
Here. Take this

211
00:11:37,094 --> 00:11:37,384
VINEGARED
SQUID

212
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:41,924
Thank you.

213
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:46,064
Toru-chan!

214
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:49,424
See these? They're delicious.

215
00:11:49,904 --> 00:11:51,274
Have some.

216
00:11:51,374 --> 00:11:52,894
Thank you, ma'am.

217
00:11:53,104 --> 00:11:54,504
Oh, that's right.

218
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:58,804
At the festival, Toru said the people
at the arcade give her things.

219
00:11:59,184 --> 00:12:01,014
Toru-chan! Here, take this!

220
00:12:01,014 --> 00:12:02,754
Thanks for coming by.

221
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:04,844
Here, take this bag now, Toru.

222
00:12:05,054 --> 00:12:07,284
She ain't buyin' a thing!

223
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:11,594
Now what, all of a sudden?

224
00:12:11,594 --> 00:12:14,354
We still have time,
so we're here at the bookstore.

225
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:15,694
Oh.

226
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:19,364
There's a book I've been wanting, too. Suits me.

227
00:12:30,044 --> 00:12:31,914
Say, Toru? This...

228
00:12:38,584 --> 00:12:41,554
Omega Bookstore

229
00:12:46,024 --> 00:12:47,154
Nagi.

230
00:13:27,364 --> 00:13:29,834
One Hour Later

231
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:35,064
This manga...

232
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:38,444
The girl on the cover looks like Yuko.

233
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:40,674
Hey, isn't that a MATURE manga?

234
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:46,244
Whoa, you're right. It really looks like her!

235
00:13:46,484 --> 00:13:52,184
Look. This is a collection of shorts,
but all the heroines have the same kind of face.

236
00:14:01,104 --> 00:14:05,974
If we showed this author a picture of Yuko,
I think he'd buy it for a lot of money.

237
00:14:06,074 --> 00:14:07,704
Let's buy this.

238
00:14:08,274 --> 00:14:10,174
Okay, let's make them!

239
00:14:10,444 --> 00:14:12,484
Yuko-chan, want an apron?

240
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:13,574
Yeah. Let me use that.

241
00:14:14,414 --> 00:14:20,584
Your mom really does make sweets, huh?
There are so many cute molds!

242
00:14:20,824 --> 00:14:24,294
Is it okay for me to use ALL this?

243
00:14:24,294 --> 00:14:27,094
Yeah! She said we could use anything!

244
00:14:27,294 --> 00:14:30,164
Really? I can't wait.

245
00:14:30,364 --> 00:14:32,234
So, what should we make first?

246
00:14:32,334 --> 00:14:33,994
Um, hold on a minute.

247
00:14:34,804 --> 00:14:36,494
Got it.

248
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,164
This! Pancakes!

249
00:14:44,714 --> 00:14:46,584
Even though it's Halloween?

250
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:49,884
Yeah! Today feels like pancakes!

251
00:14:49,884 --> 00:14:51,914
O-oh?

252
00:14:55,154 --> 00:14:58,954
That's right! The other day,
I broke an egg one-handed!

253
00:14:59,924 --> 00:15:00,954
Watch!

254
00:15:31,794 --> 00:15:34,354
The other day, I broke an egg one-handed!

255
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:40,394
Run! Let's move on to the next step!

256
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:43,134
Is this about right?

257
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:44,834
Yes, I think it's good.

258
00:15:46,074 --> 00:15:47,814
Well, let's cook it.

259
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:48,574
Okay.

260
00:15:52,714 --> 00:15:53,444
Run!

261
00:16:07,524 --> 00:16:09,624
Thank good-

262
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:17,394
Ow...

263
00:16:24,744 --> 00:16:28,284
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'll make it again!

264
00:16:28,284 --> 00:16:30,804
I-It's okay. You don't have to rush.

265
00:16:31,154 --> 00:16:35,114
I'm the one who was clumsy.
Why should YOU have to pay, too?

266
00:16:35,354 --> 00:16:37,884
No, don't worry about it.

267
00:16:38,494 --> 00:16:41,954
That's it! I have to become a victim, too!

268
00:16:48,804 --> 00:16:50,324
What should we do?

269
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:52,544
Wanna take a bath?

270
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:53,634
Yeah.

271
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:01,314
Yuko-chan.

272
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:04,654
You're neat, Yuko-chan. So stylish.

273
00:17:04,654 --> 00:17:06,484
That's not true at all.

274
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,384
Sure enough, is it because you have a pet?

275
00:17:08,754 --> 00:17:13,124
What was it, it sounded like something else...

276
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,964
A tapeworm!

277
00:17:15,964 --> 00:17:17,034
That again?!

278
00:17:17,034 --> 00:17:19,064
Thanks to the power of tapeworm, right?

279
00:17:19,064 --> 00:17:21,904
I don't have that, and it ain't a pet!

280
00:17:34,214 --> 00:17:36,684
Looking like THIS in someone else's house...

281
00:17:39,384 --> 00:17:41,684
I'll put a change of clothes in the living room.

282
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:46,044
I wish she'd brought them
into the washroom with her.

283
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,114
Dynamite!

284
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:51,234
Y-you're here?!

285
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:53,664
Such shameful behavior
in someone else's house!

286
00:17:53,664 --> 00:17:56,434
I don't recall raising such a lewd daughter!

287
00:17:56,734 --> 00:17:58,264
Huh? Wh-what?

288
00:17:58,574 --> 00:17:59,944
What're you saying?

289
00:17:59,944 --> 00:18:02,114
And what's with these outrageous breasts?!

290
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:04,174
Huh? What?!

291
00:18:04,174 --> 00:18:05,774
Nagi, what's goin' on?

292
00:18:06,014 --> 00:18:09,914
She's been practicing this for YOU,
Yuko, so just listen.

293
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:10,904
To what?

294
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,484
Note: Parody of this show's creator, bb Kuroda cc Hakuda

295
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:15,484
What is that manga?!

296
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:19,294
We found an EROTIC manga
with someone who looks just like you.

297
00:18:19,294 --> 00:18:22,384
Huh? No! A dirty manga?

298
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:24,924
Here, have a peep.

299
00:18:25,064 --> 00:18:28,834
No! Cut it out! I hate that erotic stuff!

300
00:18:30,274 --> 00:18:31,204
Jeez!

301
00:18:33,304 --> 00:18:35,904
What is this? Eew!

302
00:18:36,214 --> 00:18:37,884
So she says, but she looks like
she'll read it all, huh?

303
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,284
I don't believe it!
So she says, but she looks like
she'll read it all, huh?

304
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,844
So she says, but she looks like
she'll read it all, huh?

305
00:18:40,844 --> 00:18:42,814
Yuko-chan, what's the matter?

306
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:44,404
Hey-

307
00:18:45,954 --> 00:18:47,584
What's the matter, Toru?

308
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,254
Run-chan, not you.

309
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,624
It seems she's rather taken with it.

310
00:18:52,824 --> 00:18:53,624
VINEGARED SQUID Sponge Cake

311
00:18:53,624 --> 00:18:56,434
VINEGARED SQUID Sponge Cake
Wow! So many snacks!

312
00:18:56,994 --> 00:18:59,834
Toru got all this from the shopping arcade.

313
00:19:00,164 --> 00:19:02,174
That's great, Toru!

314
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:07,874
I'm glad. Still, I wanted everyone
to have pancakes...

315
00:19:09,644 --> 00:19:11,544
Run-chan's pancakes!

316
00:19:11,744 --> 00:19:13,884
But I messed up.

317
00:19:13,884 --> 00:19:15,044
Don't worry about it.

318
00:19:15,414 --> 00:19:19,644
Yeah. But I wanted to
eat pancakes with you all...

319
00:19:19,884 --> 00:19:21,824
You can just make them next time.

320
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,354
Yeah. You're right.

321
00:19:25,024 --> 00:19:27,294
Well, should we get started?

322
00:19:27,594 --> 00:19:29,224
Okay, let's make a toast!

323
00:19:30,394 --> 00:19:33,764
It's Halloween, so maybe
we should toast the ghosts!

324
00:19:33,934 --> 00:19:36,904
Yeah, you're right. Wait, that makes no sense!

325
00:19:38,604 --> 00:19:39,664
Hold on a minute.

326
00:19:43,174 --> 00:19:44,644
Let's make them now.

327
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:46,474
Huh?

328
00:19:47,314 --> 00:19:51,154
Make them again? But we don't have
any more pancake mix.

329
00:19:51,154 --> 00:19:52,514
It's all right.

330

332
00:19:57,194 --> 00:19:58,554
We can make them with this.

Crazy Love Cake!

334
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,064

375
00:21:14,634 --> 00:21:16,334
Here, Yuko. Say "Ahh."

376
00:21:16,334 --> 00:21:17,734
C'mon, stop that.

377
00:21:25,944 --> 00:21:28,104
I'm full!

378
00:21:28,414 --> 00:21:30,514
Nagi, what about your diet?

379
00:21:30,654 --> 00:21:33,714
D-didn't you measure the calories?!

380
00:21:33,954 --> 00:21:37,224
Not to worry. I cut back on the sweet stuff.

381
00:21:37,224 --> 00:21:40,024
Oh, jeez. Don't scare me like that.

382
00:21:41,294 --> 00:21:44,194
Toru. We'll do the cleaning up together.

383
00:21:45,164 --> 00:21:46,824
Toru, about your outfit...

384
00:21:47,064 --> 00:21:49,334
It's cute, like cosplay, huh?

385
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:54,374
It's 'cuz of outfits like THIS
that kids swarm around her.

386
00:21:54,574 --> 00:21:56,914
Good thing, huh, Toru?

387
00:21:56,914 --> 00:22:00,344
No, they were pulling her clothes,
crying madly, that sort of thing.

388
00:22:00,544 --> 00:22:04,114
Shouldn't you have done like last year
and passed out candy?

389
00:22:06,854 --> 00:22:09,154
Toru likes kids, so last year-

390
00:22:09,624 --> 00:22:11,524
You don't have to mention that.

391
00:22:11,624 --> 00:22:13,284
What's wrong, Toru?

392
00:22:17,464 --> 00:22:19,524
Toru, that's WAY unexpected!

393
00:22:19,634 --> 00:22:20,494
No!

394
00:22:20,604 --> 00:22:22,094
Toru likes kids.

395
00:22:22,204 --> 00:22:23,894
No!

396
00:22:41,824 --> 00:22:47,064
Silhouettes, taller than us,
line against the madder tree

397
00:22:47,064 --> 00:22:54,024
The end to an enjoyable day

398
00:22:55,874 --> 00:23:03,044
There's lots, lots of this long story left

399
00:23:03,044 --> 00:23:10,384
But it's about time I have to get home

400
00:23:10,384 --> 00:23:13,684
Okay, see you tomorrow

401
00:23:13,924 --> 00:23:17,224
I'll e-mail you

402
00:23:17,594 --> 00:23:24,864
On today's page, everyone had matching smiles

403
00:23:24,864 --> 00:23:28,164
Okay, see you tomorrow

404
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:31,834
Thanks for everything

405
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:40,714
I'm glad we could be together again today

406
00:23:40,714 --> 00:23:47,884
La-la-laa, humming to our hearts and the wind

407
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:54,454
At the next corner, a bye-bye
while looking over our shoulders

408
00:23:55,994 --> 00:23:57,234
yup!

409
00:23:57,234 --> 00:23:57,994
yup!
What do you think this subtitle means?

410
00:23:57,994 --> 00:23:59,534
What do you think this subtitle means?

411
00:23:59,534 --> 00:24:01,234
Hmm, soft drinks?

412
00:24:01,234 --> 00:24:03,804
Isn't it a bit sad, feigning ignorance
when you really know?

413
00:24:03,804 --> 00:24:07,004
Shut up! It was a promise.

414
00:24:07,004 --> 00:24:12,714
I, Yutaka, think that it's about time
that "Yutaka" appears in the subtitle.

415
00:24:12,714 --> 00:24:16,084
I don't think that idea
is going to go anywhere at all.
