00:00:19,044 --> 00:00:20,204
Toru.

2
00:00:21,954 --> 00:00:23,924
Run-chan! Jeez...

3
00:00:27,154 --> 00:00:28,644
What is it?

4
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:32,784
Thank you, Toru.

5
00:01:11,934 --> 00:01:14,834
Cloudy and ephemeral

6
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:23,584
Becoming one with the glittering, faraway sky

7
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:31,684
My wind-reading, willful destination is far away

8
00:01:32,224 --> 00:01:35,354
Let's go together

9
00:01:35,354 --> 00:01:41,054
I'll inhale deeply and go, the world's spring breath

10
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:46,464
The smiling faces of everyone gathered in the sun

11
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:53,914
In between "Good morning" and
"Goodbye," there is only us

12
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:57,474
We can do anything, can't we?

13
00:01:57,844 --> 00:02:03,584
Transparent beams of sunlight, a newborn sky

14
00:02:03,784 --> 00:02:09,694
A morning arch at which we promised to meet

15
00:02:09,694 --> 00:02:17,184
To you, waving your hand, I'll give a special today

16
00:02:17,364 --> 00:02:20,594
And the talking will begin

Good morning.

22
00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:53,234
Oh, good morning.
Another cold day today, huh?

23
00:02:53,234 --> 00:02:56,004
Can't it be spring already?

24
00:02:56,604 --> 00:02:59,774
Speaking of, isn't Toru's birthday coming up?

25
00:02:59,774 --> 00:03:01,604
Yeah, that's right.

26
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,804
So, will you have a party?

27
00:03:03,914 --> 00:03:05,504
No, that's fine.

28
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,584
Come on, don't be shy.

29
00:03:07,984 --> 00:03:10,504
Look forward to your present this year, okay?

30
00:03:11,754 --> 00:03:13,724
"Look forward" to it?

31
00:03:14,124 --> 00:03:15,854
Don't tell me it'll be one of THOSE!

32
00:03:16,194 --> 00:03:18,884
What was that thing anyway?

33
00:03:23,764 --> 00:03:25,664
Those school uniforms...

34
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:29,934
Yeah, they're probably in elementary school.
There's a graduation ceremony today.

35
00:03:30,804 --> 00:03:32,464
Oh, really?

36
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:35,904
Come the new year, those kids will be
taking entrance exams, right?

37
00:03:36,214 --> 00:03:39,374
And we'll be a year older, huh?

38
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:42,174
Entrance exams...

39
00:03:42,314 --> 00:03:44,124
Entrance exams?

40
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:45,914
Brings back memories, doesn't it, Toru?

41
00:03:47,454 --> 00:03:48,584
Yeah.

42
00:03:53,194 --> 00:03:53,534
NIKOU

43
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:54,834
NIKOU
Ah, I have to hurry and come up
with a second choice.

44
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,964
Ah, I have to hurry and come up
with a second choice.

45
00:03:57,964 --> 00:04:00,404
So you already have a first choice?

46
00:04:00,404 --> 00:04:05,274
Yeah. With my grades, they think this is
the closest to being at my level.

47
00:04:06,244 --> 00:04:08,434
What will you do for high school, Toru?

48
00:04:08,614 --> 00:04:11,544
I guess you haven't decided yet,
being a second-year.

49
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:13,444
I want to try for the same place.

50
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:19,214
For Nikou? You can go to a better school, right?
You have good grades.

51
00:04:19,354 --> 00:04:19,944
No.

52
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:22,624
I'll go wherever YOU go.

53
00:04:27,664 --> 00:04:28,594
Here.

54
00:04:28,694 --> 00:04:29,824
Thank you.

55
00:04:30,034 --> 00:04:33,194
Well? Have you decided on your high school?

56
00:04:33,604 --> 00:04:35,964
Yeah, kind of.

57
00:04:36,174 --> 00:04:38,174
What about Nikou?

58
00:04:38,174 --> 00:04:41,634
Well, why not? It's well regarded.

59
00:04:41,974 --> 00:04:44,274
And they use a grade curve there, don't they?

60
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,374
Yeah.

61
00:04:45,544 --> 00:04:50,914
Oh. And Toru said she'd go to
the high school that I go to.

62
00:04:52,624 --> 00:04:54,884
Go to a better school.

63
00:04:55,054 --> 00:04:56,154
B-but...

64
00:04:56,424 --> 00:04:59,224
A better one will make things easier for you later.

65
00:04:59,224 --> 00:05:01,264
You just said Nikou would be good-

66
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:02,524
I've changed my mind!

67
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:08,634
But even if I tried, I know how it'll turn out.

68
00:05:09,104 --> 00:05:11,574
The grage curfe won' be enoush.

69
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,764
That's right.

70
00:05:13,374 --> 00:05:14,744
NOW, that is.

71
00:05:15,974 --> 00:05:19,044
W-wait! Who are you calling?

72
00:05:19,044 --> 00:05:19,844
A cram school.

73
00:05:19,844 --> 00:05:21,444
No!

74
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,664
Fine. I get it.

75
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,524
Forcing you to do it wouldn't change anything.

76
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:36,384
So!

77
00:05:40,434 --> 00:05:43,204
What about all-you-can-eat Kobe beef?

78
00:05:45,174 --> 00:05:46,934
Okay! I'll try!

79
00:05:50,144 --> 00:05:53,114
Run-chan, you went for a high-tier school?

80
00:05:53,114 --> 00:05:54,644
Yeah, I guess.

81
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,454
I decided to after talking with my mom.

82
00:05:57,454 --> 00:06:02,484
So you're doing cram school and got a tutor?
You're so determined!

83
00:06:02,724 --> 00:06:05,454
My tutor is someone you know, Hira-chan.

84
00:06:06,064 --> 00:06:06,964
There.

85
00:06:13,134 --> 00:06:14,374
Introducing!

86
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,304
Miss Toru!

87
00:06:16,304 --> 00:06:16,934
Pleased to meet you.

88
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:21,244
But Toru-chan doesn't...

89
00:06:21,444 --> 00:06:26,344
Yes, that's true, but glasses are a must.
After all, she's a teacher.

90
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,144
I'm not talking about her glasses...

91
00:06:30,784 --> 00:06:32,584
Very well. Let's begin studying.

92
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,984
We'll start with something simple.

93
00:06:51,174 --> 00:06:53,904
For now, remember this. All of it.

94
00:06:56,014 --> 00:06:58,134
It's basic. Simple memorization.

95
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:01,004
I-It's so much...

96
00:07:11,824 --> 00:07:12,854
Jenga!

97
00:07:29,244 --> 00:07:30,804
The answer there is "A"!

98
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,684
Multiple-choice questions are tricky. Be careful!

99
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:36,214
What's this?

100
00:07:36,314 --> 00:07:39,184
What's this voice in my head
that's talking to me?!

101
00:07:42,154 --> 00:07:45,824
My hand! It's like it's not mine,
writing the answer!

102
00:07:46,364 --> 00:07:48,124
What's going on?!

103
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:53,664
Huh?

104
00:07:55,104 --> 00:07:56,594
A dream?

105
00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:04,174
Ah! The letters!

106
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,504
Wait!

107
00:08:05,784 --> 00:08:09,114
I won't be able to solve the problem!

108
00:08:11,454 --> 00:08:12,474
Huh?

109
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:16,624
Run-chan. Wake up.

110
00:08:23,134 --> 00:08:24,304
A dream?

111
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,164

Ah, sorry. I dropped them in the bathtub.

Begin!

132
00:09:52,954 --> 00:09:55,454
Gotta use another pencil...

133
00:09:55,454 --> 00:09:56,894

137
00:10:10,974 --> 00:10:15,344
I'm sorry. Did my pencil lead fly at you?

138
00:10:15,744 --> 00:10:17,714
Nah, it's fine.

139
00:10:18,114 --> 00:10:19,414
I'm glad!

140
00:10:19,414 --> 00:10:21,404
So it wasn't a sabotage.

141
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:26,854
Oh, you came from Kansai today
just for the test?

142
00:10:26,854 --> 00:10:30,424
Yeah. I'll be movin' here this spring. So I-

143
00:10:30,424 --> 00:10:32,554
Ah! Speaking of Kansai...

144
00:10:38,964 --> 00:10:41,404
It's my good-luck charm for today!

Like, the god of cows or something?

146
00:10:56,784 --> 00:11:00,824
I did it! There it is! It's there!

147
00:11:00,824 --> 00:11:02,514
Look, that's my number!

148
00:11:02,994 --> 00:11:05,514
I passed thanks to YOU, Toru!

149
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:10,534
No. It's because of your hard work.
Congratulations.

150
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:17,834
So, that's how it went.
Somehow, I passed the test.

151
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:21,494
Run, you worked hard!

152
00:11:21,774 --> 00:11:24,914
I'd write vocab on my hands
so I wouldn't forget them.

153
00:11:24,914 --> 00:11:29,044
Ah. I've written stuff on my hands
so I won't forget them, too.

154
00:11:29,254 --> 00:11:32,454
But if you did that for the test,
you'd be cheating, huh?

155
00:11:32,454 --> 00:11:35,224
Of course I washed them for the test!

I'd written all over my body,

They announce the results today, right?
Aren't they already posting on the signboards?

00:11:50,904 --> 00:11:51,964
Yeah...

164
00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:53,704
I'll go later.

165
00:11:53,704 --> 00:11:55,244

Here. It's almost your birthday, right?

173
00:12:29,614 --> 00:12:30,444
Cake?

00:12:30,544 --> 00:12:31,344
Cake!

175
00:12:38,654 --> 00:12:40,994
They call that the three-second rule, right?

176
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:43,584
Um, that was completely upside-down.

177
00:12:43,894 --> 00:12:45,384
Fooled ya!

00:12:47,124 --> 00:12:49,924
Ta-daa! THIS is the real one.

179
00:12:50,234 --> 00:12:51,524
Did I get you?

180
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,104
I heard that giving something

00:12:54,104 --> 00:12:56,504
will make them even happier!

182
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,334
And I wanted you to be happy!

183
00:12:59,644 --> 00:13:01,304
Who did you hear that from?

184
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:04,144
I'll hold the cake.

185
00:13:04,144 --> 00:13:07,174
No, I won't drop it again!

186
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:08,684
It's fine.

187
00:13:08,684 --> 00:13:11,084
But I can't make you carry something.

188
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:12,684
IT'S FINE.

189
00:13:13,054 --> 00:13:15,214
Toru, are you angry?

190
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:21,924
You're gonna be 16 already, aren't you?
You've gotten big.

191
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:24,654
You used to be so small, though!

192
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:28,834
You'd be on all fours, chasing after me...

193
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:35,074
And you'd cry if you weren't always
holding some candy. That was so cute.

194
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:36,874
Run-chan...

195
00:13:37,844 --> 00:13:39,674
What are you talking about?

196
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:42,184
About a dream I had the other day.

197
00:13:42,184 --> 00:13:42,514
THEY MET WHILE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
About a dream I had the other day.

198
00:13:42,514 --> 00:13:42,814
THEY MET WHILE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

199
00:13:42,814 --> 00:13:43,954
THEY MET WHILE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
A dream?

200
00:13:43,954 --> 00:13:44,214
THEY MET WHILE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

201
00:13:44,384 --> 00:13:48,624
Look, you've gotten THIS tall.
You're still small, though.

202
00:13:48,624 --> 00:13:49,784
I'll always
be small
Look, you've gotten THIS tall.
You're still small, though.

203
00:13:52,394 --> 00:13:54,554
Don't treat me like a child.

204
00:13:59,634 --> 00:14:00,894
I found a gray hair!

205
00:14:06,204 --> 00:14:09,204
You brought cake to school?
That's brave of you.

206
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:12,484
There's enough for everyone,
so let's eat at lunch.

207
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,484
Where will you put it till lunch?

208
00:14:14,484 --> 00:14:17,754
Oh, that's right! They have to be kept cold, huh?

209
00:14:17,754 --> 00:14:20,154
We don't have one, do we?

210
00:14:20,154 --> 00:14:23,214
What if we put it in the
coldest part of the school?

211
00:14:23,824 --> 00:14:24,824
The bathroom, huh?

212
00:14:24,824 --> 00:14:25,854
Ulp...

213
00:14:26,124 --> 00:14:28,284
YOU'RE gonna be eating some, too.

214
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:32,234
So it's almost Toru's birthday, huh?

215
00:14:32,234 --> 00:14:33,564
Congratulations.

216
00:14:33,564 --> 00:14:34,504
Thanks
a lot

217
00:14:35,004 --> 00:14:36,934
What will you do on your actual birthday?

218
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:41,344
Not to worry! I've got a present for her
on her real birthday!

219
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:46,184
Huh. I'll give you that book
you wanted the other day.

220
00:14:46,184 --> 00:14:47,374
Thank you.

221
00:14:47,514 --> 00:14:49,244
I...

222
00:14:50,314 --> 00:14:51,144
A cup.

223
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,384
A cup?

224
00:14:52,384 --> 00:14:52,584
What's
with that
ruler?
A cup?

225
00:14:52,584 --> 00:14:53,314
What's
with that
ruler?
What kind?

226
00:14:56,094 --> 00:14:57,354
An E cup.

227
00:15:00,494 --> 00:15:03,894
Come on, let's eat that cake. Before it goes bad.

228
00:15:04,064 --> 00:15:05,264
Yeah, you're right.

229
00:15:10,174 --> 00:15:11,104
Nice!

230
00:15:11,104 --> 00:15:12,304
They look delicious.

231
00:15:12,304 --> 00:15:13,774
Heart-Pounding Game!

232
00:15:14,374 --> 00:15:17,534
Actually, one of these cakes has wasabi in it!

233
00:15:17,744 --> 00:15:20,144
Can't you just celebrate normally?

234
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:23,154
One of them is clearly green.

235
00:15:23,254 --> 00:15:24,654
That's totally obvious!

236
00:15:30,594 --> 00:15:32,614
I'll let Yuko play the starring role.

237
00:15:32,694 --> 00:15:33,324
Here.

238
00:15:33,864 --> 00:15:35,234
After all, you're from Kansai.

239
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,854
Sure am jealous.

240
00:15:37,094 --> 00:15:38,154
SPICY...

241
00:15:39,404 --> 00:15:40,764
Well, shall we eat?

242
00:15:43,204 --> 00:15:45,044
Do not be shocked!

243
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,674
The cake with wasabi in it...

244
00:15:46,674 --> 00:15:48,234
Was one of two-!

245
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:50,904
Run-chan!

246
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:56,614
It sure is cute. This cake.

247
00:16:03,654 --> 00:16:05,214
Oh. A celebratory pic, huh?

248
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:07,384
N-nice.

249
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,634
We should all take one together.

250
00:16:09,634 --> 00:16:10,694
Okay.

251
00:16:17,074 --> 00:16:18,564
Yuko. You're blurry.

252
00:16:18,674 --> 00:16:19,664
Huh?!

253
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,874
I didn't move!

254
00:16:22,174 --> 00:16:23,414
Maybe you were twitching.

255
00:16:23,414 --> 00:16:24,244
Because
of the
wasabi?
Maybe you were twitching.

256
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,414
Let's take another!

257
00:16:26,414 --> 00:16:28,444
Okay, everyone do like Yuko.

258
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,214
Just take it normally!

259
00:16:34,824 --> 00:16:37,584
Ah, I moved! One more time!

260
00:16:37,694 --> 00:16:40,784
Okay, everyone do like Yuko again. One, two...

261
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:43,564
Ah, I moved again!

262
00:16:44,664 --> 00:16:46,324
Jeez!

263
00:16:49,204 --> 00:16:51,694
Okay, continuing from yesterday...

264
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:55,344
Yesterday, we used covered area principle

265
00:16:55,344 --> 00:16:59,114
to determine the volume
and surface area of a sphere.

266
00:16:59,344 --> 00:17:03,014
Volume V was 4/3 pi R3, and
surface area S was 4 pi R2, yes?

267
00:17:03,014 --> 00:17:06,584
Torun?
Volume V was 4/3 pi R3, and
surface area S was 4 pi R2, yes?

268
00:17:06,584 --> 00:17:11,324
Cake! Th-this is... Um, um, um!
Following problem No. 51 in your textbooks,
let's try using a sphere like the one shown,

269
00:17:11,324 --> 00:17:12,394
Following problem No. 51 in your textbooks,
let's try using a sphere like the one shown,

270
00:17:12,394 --> 00:17:16,464
where diameter equals height, comparing the
ratio of volume and surface area of a cylinder,

271
00:17:16,464 --> 00:17:18,164
circular cone and sphere
in relation to basal diameter.

272
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:20,934
Torun! TORUN!
circular cone and sphere
in relation to basal diameter.

273
00:17:24,274 --> 00:17:26,294
Congratulations.

274
00:17:34,084 --> 00:17:35,274
Here->

275
00:17:37,254 --> 00:17:39,924
Okay, Yutaka-san. Solve the problem.

276
00:17:39,924 --> 00:17:41,484
HUH?!

277
00:17:47,864 --> 00:17:49,724
Here! Look!

278
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:52,334
What's that?

279
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,864
A picture from when I was studying for exams!

280
00:17:56,104 --> 00:17:57,404
Two years ago, huh?

281
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,304
You're eating cake.

282
00:17:59,304 --> 00:18:02,504
Yeah. That was Toru's birthday.

283
00:18:02,774 --> 00:18:05,004
Why are you making her feed you?

284
00:18:05,244 --> 00:18:06,544
Such is the life of a test-taker!

285
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,274
Don't interrupt me, Toru!
Such is the life of a test-taker!

286
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,584
Just kidding!

287
00:18:10,584 --> 00:18:13,454
Here! Happy birthday, Toru!

288
00:18:14,554 --> 00:18:17,424
But you didn't forget her present, huh?

289
00:18:17,694 --> 00:18:21,654
Yeah. That's the main thing. Also...

290
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:23,394
Look.

291
00:18:23,664 --> 00:18:24,424
What's this?

292
00:18:24,664 --> 00:18:27,294
This is Toru's birthday last year.

293
00:18:27,804 --> 00:18:30,104
This time, Toru was the test-taker, huh?

294
00:18:30,104 --> 00:18:31,204
That's right.

295
00:18:31,204 --> 00:18:33,744
Toru, Good Luck
Toru said I didn't have to,
since she was studying for exams,

296
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:34,344
Toru, Good Luck
but I wanted to get her cake and a present.

297
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:35,114
but I wanted to get her cake and a present.

298
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,804
Say "Aah."
but I wanted to get her cake and a present.

299
00:18:37,914 --> 00:18:39,844
Weren't you a distraction?

300
00:18:39,844 --> 00:18:44,084
Not at all! Right, Toru?

301
00:18:45,454 --> 00:18:47,444
Toru worked hard too, huh?

302
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,124
And...

303
00:18:51,224 --> 00:18:55,494
Ta-daa! Here's THIS year's
commemorative photo!

304
00:18:57,064 --> 00:19:00,404
Hey, what's with that photo?!

305
00:19:00,404 --> 00:19:01,834
I just got it from Toru.

306
00:19:01,834 --> 00:19:02,374
Jeez, erase that thing!
I just got it from Toru.

307
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:03,834
Jeez, erase that thing!

308
00:19:03,834 --> 00:19:04,544
Hey! I swear.

309
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:05,544
No way.
Hey! I swear.

310
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:06,944
Give me that phone! I'll erase it myself.
Hey! I swear.

311
00:19:06,944 --> 00:19:08,104
Let's go, Toru.

312
00:19:08,344 --> 00:19:09,074
No!

313
00:19:09,074 --> 00:19:09,474
Please!
No!

314
00:19:09,474 --> 00:19:10,744

Well, I'm going this way today.

341
00:20:51,814 --> 00:20:53,214
Bye-bye!

342
00:20:57,014 --> 00:20:59,454
It's gone by so fast, huh?

343
00:20:59,454 --> 00:21:01,994
I was thinking about how you'd
just entered our school,

344
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,484
but you'll already be a second-year soon.

345
00:21:04,724 --> 00:21:05,984
Yeah.

346
00:21:07,024 --> 00:21:10,084
Then Run will be a third-year...

347
00:21:16,434 --> 00:21:17,874
Toru, Good Luck

348
00:21:52,974 --> 00:21:54,274
Toru.

349
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,344
What's the matter?

350
00:22:03,414 --> 00:22:04,754
Nothing at all.

351
00:22:04,754 --> 00:22:05,824
Really?

352
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,714
Yeah.

353
00:22:07,154 --> 00:22:09,024
By the way, Run-chan...

354
00:22:09,024 --> 00:22:09,924
Hm?

355
00:22:09,924 --> 00:22:13,464
I'm late in asking, but why did you
change to THIS high school?

356
00:22:13,464 --> 00:22:15,824
Mm, why do you think?

357
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:16,894
Tell me.

358
00:22:16,994 --> 00:22:18,724
It's. A. Secret.

359
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:20,354
Whaat?

360
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:47,024
Silhouettes, taller than us,
line against the madder tree

361
00:22:47,024 --> 00:22:53,994
The end to an enjoyable day

362
00:22:55,834 --> 00:23:03,014
There's lots, lots of this long story left

363
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:10,354
But it's about time I have to get home

364
00:23:10,354 --> 00:23:13,654
Okay, see you tomorrow

365
00:23:13,884 --> 00:23:17,184
I'll e-mail you

366
00:23:17,554 --> 00:23:24,834
On today's page, everyone had matching smiles

367
00:23:24,834 --> 00:23:28,134
Okay, see you tomorrow

368
00:23:28,504 --> 00:23:31,804
Thanks for everything

369
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:40,684
I'm glad we could be together again today

370
00:23:40,684 --> 00:23:47,854
La-la-laa, humming to our hearts and the wind

371
00:23:47,854 --> 00:23:54,424
At the next corner, a bye-bye
while looking over our shoulders

372
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:56,794
yup!

373
00:23:56,794 --> 00:23:57,834
yup!
Someone from outer space?

374
00:23:57,834 --> 00:23:57,934
yup!
Someone from outer space!

375
00:23:57,934 --> 00:23:58,864
Someone from outer space!

376
00:23:58,864 --> 00:24:01,734
Come to correct the wrongs of
present-day Earth?!

377
00:24:01,734 --> 00:24:03,274
That would be someone from the FUTURE.

378
00:24:03,274 --> 00:24:05,104
Pithecanthropus Erectus!

379
00:24:05,104 --> 00:24:08,574
Currently, it's Homo Erectus.
Wait, that's primitive man!

380
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:09,214
The only one who can call out
my air-headedness is YOU, Miporin!

381
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:10,314

383

That doesn't make me happy at all.
