00:00:04,264 --> 00:00:05,754
Toru!

2
00:00:06,564 --> 00:00:07,834
Toru!

3
00:00:08,734 --> 00:00:10,294
Wanna eat some ice cream?

4
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,664
Huh? She's not here.

5
00:00:19,384 --> 00:00:20,874
Run-chan...

6
00:00:23,354 --> 00:00:25,544
What are you doing over there?

7
00:00:25,724 --> 00:00:27,284
I was sleeping and I fell off.

8
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:30,084
I can't move. Help me.

9
00:00:32,494 --> 00:00:34,334
Coochy coochy coochy coo!
Coochy coochy coochy coo!

10
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,164
Stop it! Stop it!
Coochy coochy coochy coo!

11
00:00:40,404 --> 00:00:42,434
What are you doing?

12
00:00:42,434 --> 00:00:42,734
I followed my impulse.

13
00:00:42,734 --> 00:00:44,844
Saved
I followed my impulse.

14
00:00:45,874 --> 00:00:46,674
I'll take one more!

15
00:00:46,774 --> 00:00:48,604
Stop it.

16
00:00:48,914 --> 00:00:50,574
Nice shot!

17
00:01:03,524 --> 00:01:06,424

Okay, Toru.

30
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,434
Let's eat!

31
00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:31,374
It's delicious!

32
00:02:36,414 --> 00:02:39,084
Toru? Your bangs have gotten
longer, haven't they?

33
00:02:39,324 --> 00:02:43,924
Yes. I haven't touched them at all
since summer vacation began.

34
00:02:43,924 --> 00:02:45,694
I can cut them for you!

35
00:02:45,694 --> 00:02:46,494
Huh?

36
00:02:46,764 --> 00:02:47,824
Scissors!

37
00:02:48,564 --> 00:02:49,964
Using THOSE scissors?

38
00:02:50,264 --> 00:02:52,564
Don't move, okay?

39
00:02:58,204 --> 00:03:00,764
Wait! You're going to cut straight across?!

40
00:03:02,574 --> 00:03:03,874
Huh?

41
00:03:05,744 --> 00:03:08,414
Um... You look younger now, huh?

42
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,884
A book bag would really suit you!

43
00:03:11,054 --> 00:03:12,914
I didn't even use those in middle school.

44
00:03:13,654 --> 00:03:16,524
It's no good. I can't go to school.

45
00:03:16,724 --> 00:03:19,054
This is summer vacation.

46
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,334
We have an orientation day.

47
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,634
Don't worry. It's cute!

48
00:03:23,634 --> 00:03:24,654
Forget it.

49
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:29,664
Well... Ah!

50
00:03:30,874 --> 00:03:33,134
Put this like THIS...

51
00:03:35,144 --> 00:03:38,114
Finished! Now we match.

52
00:03:40,814 --> 00:03:42,114
We match.

55
00:03:57,664 --> 00:03:58,654
Yes!

56
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:01,834
Good morning.

57
00:04:02,404 --> 00:04:07,394
Good morning, Toru-chan.
Sorry, Run's still asleep.

58
00:04:07,674 --> 00:04:09,544
Would you wake her up for me?

59
00:04:10,074 --> 00:04:12,204
Understood. Excuse me.

60
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:17,314
Run-chan. It's orientation day.

61
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:22,884
Run-chan. We're going to school.

62
00:04:28,734 --> 00:04:32,534
It's summer, but you're wearing
long sleeves again.

63
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:37,764
I've told you, a summer sweater
would be cuter, haven't I?

64
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:39,364
Run-chan!

65
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:42,174
Okay, banzai!

66
00:04:42,174 --> 00:04:44,344
Fine, I'll take it off! I'll take it off!

67
00:04:44,344 --> 00:04:45,574
Banzai!
Fine, I'll take it off! I'll take it off!

68
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:51,074
It's so hot!

69
00:04:52,924 --> 00:04:55,394
I'm kinda lightheaded...

70
00:04:56,294 --> 00:04:57,824
Run-chan! That's not the school.

71
00:04:57,824 --> 00:04:58,624
Beware of
Gropers!
Run-chan! That's not the school.

72
00:04:58,624 --> 00:05:01,394
Beware of
Gropers!

73
00:05:01,394 --> 00:05:06,164
Beware of
Gropers!
Eew, Summer brings out more
perverts and gropers, huh?

74
00:05:06,164 --> 00:05:06,334
Beware of
Gropers!

75
00:05:06,334 --> 00:05:10,004
Beware of
Gropers!
Apparently, some of them even
call out while driving by.

76
00:05:10,004 --> 00:05:14,944
Beware of
Gropers!
Ugh, how nasty. We have to be careful, huh?

77
00:05:14,944 --> 00:05:15,804
Beware of
Gropers!

78
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,644
Hey, it's hot out. Want a ride to school?

79
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:26,084
Beware of
Gropers!

80
00:05:26,224 --> 00:05:27,414
A groper!

81
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,824
Somebody! There's a pervert over here!

82
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:36,164
B-But I...

83
00:05:36,164 --> 00:05:37,334
A pervert?

84
00:05:37,334 --> 00:05:39,734
Should we call the police?

85
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:45,374
It's a misunderstanding!
I'm a teacher at their school.

86
00:05:45,374 --> 00:05:47,004
Please don't call the police!

87
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:52,274
Okay, everyone take a printout
and pass it behind you.

88
00:05:52,484 --> 00:05:56,484
You can take till the next semester
to fill out that survey.

89
00:05:56,484 --> 00:05:57,644

103
00:06:36,054 --> 00:06:37,424
Miss Kito.

104
00:06:37,924 --> 00:06:39,124
Toru-san!

105
00:06:39,124 --> 00:06:43,254
Ma'am, you look pale today.
Do you feel all right?

106
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:44,694
Oh, my.

107
00:06:45,334 --> 00:06:49,064
Such a nice girl.
She's one of my students, all right.

108
00:06:49,234 --> 00:06:52,174
Yes, I've had something of a headache
since this morning.

109
00:06:52,174 --> 00:06:54,204
They have medicine in the nurse's office.

110
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,364
My DRIVE can overcome some headache.

111
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:05,314
That just won't do, Miss Kito.
Wearing the doctor's whites again?

112
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,284
I wear those, so please stop that.

113
00:07:07,624 --> 00:07:13,084
I'm allowed! I wore them
long before YOU got here!

114
00:07:13,194 --> 00:07:17,424
But that is the gown of a doctor, is it not?

115
00:07:17,534 --> 00:07:22,524
More importantly, please do something
about those ridiculous shirts, Mr. Sato!

116
00:07:22,634 --> 00:07:26,244
What's that? You're saying I have bad taste?

117
00:07:26,244 --> 00:07:29,374
I don't think you're in a position
to talk, Miss Kito.

118
00:07:29,614 --> 00:07:32,414
Then let's have Toru-san decide!

119
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:34,004
Very well.

120
00:07:34,484 --> 00:07:35,914
Huh? Toru-san?

121
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,184
Urchin-chan?

122
00:07:37,284 --> 00:07:38,424
Toru-san!

123
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:41,254
Miss Kito, couldn't you have stepped on her?

124
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:43,964
What was that?! You mean YOU did, right?

125
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,594
No, it was you, wasn't it?

126
00:07:45,594 --> 00:07:47,464
No, it was you!

127
00:07:47,464 --> 00:07:48,134
No, it was you.

128
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:48,794
I'm not that small.
No, it was you.

129
00:07:48,794 --> 00:07:49,924
No!
No, it was you.

130
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,564
That's...

131
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,764
Could it be an SOS signal?

132
00:07:59,874 --> 00:08:02,434
A freshman-year classroom? Hold on!

133
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:08,984
This way, you can clean up chalk dust
without going to the first floor.

134
00:08:08,984 --> 00:08:12,824
How do you get blackboard erasers so dirty?

135
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:14,124
Right?

136
00:08:14,124 --> 00:08:16,024
There's no "Right?" about it.

137
00:08:17,694 --> 00:08:18,664
Is there a fire?!

138
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,394
Um, upperclassman?

139
00:08:28,104 --> 00:08:29,904
What's the matter?

140
00:08:30,304 --> 00:08:33,864
I totally misread this!

141
00:08:34,344 --> 00:08:36,934
Um, that is...

142
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:41,174
I-I came to clean.

143
00:08:41,614 --> 00:08:43,174
I wanna die!

144
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:47,524
I'm sorry, upperclassman.
This girl does so many dumb things!

145
00:08:47,524 --> 00:08:52,154
No, it's fine. I always jump to
the wrong conclusion.

146
00:08:52,524 --> 00:08:57,594
This just gives me another funny story.
Right, Toru?

147
00:08:59,034 --> 00:09:05,404
If I had stopped Yutaka earlier, this would have
all ended without you getting embarrassed.

148
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:07,164
I'm sorry.

149
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:10,174
Stop that! Don't go apologizin'!

150
00:09:10,644 --> 00:09:14,044
If you apologize, it just makes me
more embarrassed!

151
00:09:14,384 --> 00:09:15,654
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:15,654 --> 00:09:17,144
Stop it!

153
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:19,254
She sure gets flustered, huh?

154
00:09:19,254 --> 00:09:20,184
Stop that!

155
00:09:21,424 --> 00:09:23,864
It really was a distress signal.

156
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:26,764
Seein' that, all I could think
is that there was a fire.

157
00:09:27,064 --> 00:09:31,054
If it were a fire, there'd be SMOKE, right?
You fly off the handle too easily.

158
00:09:31,434 --> 00:09:33,694
Try and be a bit more calm.

159
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,364
Here, Nagi-chan.

160
00:09:36,504 --> 00:09:39,404
That's hot! F-Fire!

161
00:09:41,144 --> 00:09:44,684
So, getting all flustered like that is not good.

162
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:45,844
Wait, Run!

163
00:09:46,214 --> 00:09:48,614
What's with that HOT drink in summer?

164
00:09:49,514 --> 00:09:50,484
Oh.

165
00:09:51,654 --> 00:09:53,814
I was in a hurry and chose the wrong one!

166
00:09:55,954 --> 00:09:57,514
It's so hot!

167
00:09:57,724 --> 00:10:01,324
Sure enough, it's not good for people
to get flustered, huh?

168
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:06,804
In my case, it couldn't be helped.
If it really was a fire, it would've been bad!

169
00:10:06,804 --> 00:10:08,674
Same goes for me!

170
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:11,464
Drinking hot coffee in summer
defies common sense!

171
00:10:11,604 --> 00:10:15,374
Oh! They should remove hot drinks
from vending machines for summer!

172
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:16,244
Oh.

173
00:10:17,014 --> 00:10:19,444
That's not the point, is it?

174
00:10:19,684 --> 00:10:20,544
Huh?

175
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:22,554
HOT
BLOODED

176
00:10:22,554 --> 00:10:24,284
HOT
BLOODED
Has confidence in her fashion sense...

177
00:10:24,284 --> 00:10:26,514
HOT
BLOODED
Has confidence in her fashion sense...
Maybe?

178
00:10:29,854 --> 00:10:31,854
What should I do?!

179
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:35,094
Looks like I forgot the questionnaire at school!

180
00:10:37,164 --> 00:10:38,034
Oh!

181
00:10:47,474 --> 00:10:48,374
From Yuko, huh?

182
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:51,614
"I totally forgot my questionnaire at school.

183
00:10:51,614 --> 00:10:54,784
"I wanna go get it, but I can't go alone
because it's too scary.

184
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:56,114
"Come with me."

185
00:10:56,754 --> 00:11:00,344
Jeez. That's why I told her to be more calm!

186
00:11:01,254 --> 00:11:02,244
There.

187
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,224
"Just leave it till the new semester."

188
00:11:07,224 --> 00:11:08,594
No!

189
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:18,844
"I wanna put thought into it.
C'mon, please go with me."

190
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,394
Aah, jeez!

Re: For real?
Please!!!!
It's too scary
by myself!!

197
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,514
Too scary, eh?

198
00:11:37,494 --> 00:11:41,794
Oh, no! I ran late! I bet Nagi's already there.

199
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:44,934
There she is. Hey!

200
00:11:46,704 --> 00:11:49,074
Huh? Why's everyone here?

201
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:51,234
I got a hold of these two.

202
00:11:51,904 --> 00:11:53,574
The front gate ain't open?

203
00:11:53,574 --> 00:11:56,574
We came in through the rear gate.

204
00:11:56,574 --> 00:11:58,544
The rear gate's so far...

205
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:02,084
Yuko, race as fast as you can to get here.

206
00:12:02,084 --> 00:12:04,324
Yeah, yeah. Okay, here goes...

207
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:05,874
Now, start!

208
00:12:05,984 --> 00:12:08,494
You guys are kinda impatient.

209
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,364
Now listen! Do NOT look behind you.

210
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,454
C'mon, what gives?

211
00:12:26,874 --> 00:12:28,534
That was a personal best, wasn't it?

212
00:12:28,974 --> 00:12:31,574
Okay, let's go get your sheet.

213
00:12:32,214 --> 00:12:34,874
Wait. I still can't move.

214
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,514
Oh. She's dead.

215
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,014
Sure enough, it's not open, huh?

216
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:54,694
Is the staff entrance locked, too?

217
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,374
It's impossible with this, isn't it?

218
00:12:57,374 --> 00:12:59,274
What are you trying to use?

219
00:13:01,174 --> 00:13:02,644
Dammit!

220
00:13:08,514 --> 00:13:11,144
Sure enough, school at night is scary!

221
00:13:30,474 --> 00:13:33,844
Well, a window just happened to be open!

222
00:13:33,844 --> 00:13:36,434
Careless, but today it counts in our favor.

223
00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:37,804
It sure did.

224
00:13:38,614 --> 00:13:40,084
Yuko, you're sticking too close!

225
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:41,444
Well...

226
00:13:41,914 --> 00:13:44,644
I get anxious if I don't stay close to someone.

227
00:13:44,784 --> 00:13:46,254
Okay, fine.

228
00:13:47,424 --> 00:13:50,124
I'll go to the chemistry lab and bring back
an anatomical model.

229
00:13:50,124 --> 00:13:52,124
No! Don't!

230
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:53,564
If you don't like it, let go of me!

231
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:55,024
That's even worse!

232
00:13:55,194 --> 00:13:56,834
Looks like fun, doesn't it?

233
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:56,894
I'm not so sure.

234
00:13:56,894 --> 00:13:58,634
Please, just don't do it!
I'm not so sure.

235
00:13:58,634 --> 00:13:59,154
Please, just don't do it!

236
00:13:59,404 --> 00:14:02,024
You really are scaredy cat, aren't you?

237
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:06,234
School is different at night! It's creepy!

238
00:14:06,444 --> 00:14:07,144
Oh.

239
00:14:07,144 --> 00:14:08,074
What?!

240
00:14:12,344 --> 00:14:15,944
Look, we're at school at night, so...

241
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,654
Let's go expIoring!

242
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:20,844
Yeah!

243
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,554
Let's move out!

244
00:14:23,554 --> 00:14:24,544
Yeah!

245
00:14:25,494 --> 00:14:27,764

Maa, ii jan, susumu dake, kowai mono nante nai sa
Well, it's fine, just going forward, there are no scary things

257
00:15:26,284 --> 00:15:30,054

Minna issho ni tanken shiyou
Let's everyone explore together

259
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,934
School sure is exciting at night, huh?

260
00:15:47,174 --> 00:15:48,234
Yeah.

261
00:15:50,344 --> 00:15:51,544
So scary!

262
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:56,784
Um...

263
00:15:57,054 --> 00:15:58,514
What is it?

264
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:02,654
The bathroom...

265
00:16:04,724 --> 00:16:06,164
Hey!

266
00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:08,834
We're going to the bathroom.

267
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,824
Okay. We'll wait!

268
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,204
I'm not going in the stall with you.

269
00:16:14,204 --> 00:16:15,694
I know that!

270
00:16:19,374 --> 00:16:21,104
Um, the lights...

271
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,474
Hurry up and do it.

272
00:16:22,474 --> 00:16:24,004
Okay.

273
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,284
What? What?

274
00:16:29,284 --> 00:16:31,084
Um... THAT.

275
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,754
IT CAME OUT!

276
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:49,904
It came out! It came out, it came out!

277
00:16:49,904 --> 00:16:51,044
No more constipation?

278
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,974
No, not that!

279
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,684
Th-There was a will-o'-the-wisp
at the gymnasium over there!

280
00:17:01,684 --> 00:17:06,144
Is a will-o'-the-wisp that thing that appears
right after someone dies?

281
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,954
Then if we hurry and put it back,
the person might be saved!

282
00:17:09,954 --> 00:17:11,494
What are you saying?!

283
00:17:11,494 --> 00:17:12,424
Shh!

284
00:17:16,394 --> 00:17:18,294
That will-o'-the-wisp grew legs!

285
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,494
Stay still!

286
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:21,134
I wanna see!
Footsteps... A thief?

287
00:17:21,134 --> 00:17:22,604
It'll find us!
Footsteps... A thief?

288
00:17:22,604 --> 00:17:23,624
Jeez!
Footsteps... A thief?

289
00:17:53,164 --> 00:17:55,064
Huh? Urchin-chan?

290
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:59,274
Jeez, it's Mr. Sato!

291
00:17:59,274 --> 00:18:00,974
That was a waste of a surprise.

292
00:18:00,974 --> 00:18:03,174
What are you doing here at this hour?

293
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,234
We came to clean.

294
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:13,514
Huh. You came to get
something you forgot, huh?

295
00:18:13,654 --> 00:18:15,124
Yes, that's right.

296
00:18:15,124 --> 00:18:17,394
Sir, what's with that candle?

297
00:18:17,394 --> 00:18:20,414
Ah. I like candles.

298
00:18:20,864 --> 00:18:26,824
This ephemeral flame is like my own life.
I feel a sense of kinship...

299
00:18:31,574 --> 00:18:33,204
Oh, he fell.

300
00:18:33,304 --> 00:18:34,434
Took that seriously, didn't he?

301
00:18:36,274 --> 00:18:37,814
He's not moving.

302
00:18:37,814 --> 00:18:40,144
So he fell over for real?

303
00:18:40,144 --> 00:18:41,114
He had a fit!

304
00:18:41,114 --> 00:18:42,104
Oh, no!
He had a fit!

305
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,424
First off, we have to get him to the nurse's office!

306
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:48,114
Don't have him lying down!
You're scraping his face!

307
00:18:51,594 --> 00:18:55,054
Damn, he's too heavy. We can't move him.

308
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:59,134
Oh, that's it! We should bring the bed HERE!

309
00:18:59,134 --> 00:19:00,894
And then do what?!

310
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:06,774
We two will hold him from this end.
Run, you take his legs. Toru, you help. Got it?

311
00:19:06,774 --> 00:19:07,774
Yeah.

312
00:19:07,774 --> 00:19:08,974
Understood.

313
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:11,574
Here goes. One, two!

314
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:16,444
He's so heavy!

315
00:19:17,454 --> 00:19:19,014
Heave-ho!

316
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,624
Huh? Now he's light.

317
00:19:26,024 --> 00:19:28,514
Run! You left the rest of him behind!

318
00:19:29,364 --> 00:19:30,334
Huh?

319
00:19:35,104 --> 00:19:36,174
Nurse's
Office

320
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:38,304
Nurse's
Office
Heave-ho!

321
00:19:38,674 --> 00:19:40,434
How tiring.

322
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,444
He won't wake up, will he?

323
00:19:46,444 --> 00:19:47,774
Don't do that.

324
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:50,054
Sir! Pull it together!

325
00:19:50,054 --> 00:19:51,854
Slapping him like that...

326
00:19:51,854 --> 00:19:53,114
Serves him right.

327
00:19:54,824 --> 00:19:56,084
Did he wake up?

328
00:20:00,524 --> 00:20:04,464
Sir! Sir! Please pull yourself together!

329
00:20:05,034 --> 00:20:05,364
Sir! Can you hear me?

330
00:20:05,364 --> 00:20:08,024
What's this? Run-chan?
Sir! Can you hear me?

331
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:12,474
Mr. Sato! You can't die!

332
00:20:12,474 --> 00:20:13,634
Run-chan!

333
00:20:15,244 --> 00:20:17,334
I won't die!

334
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:19,834
Snap.

335
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:23,184
Run-chan...

336
00:20:30,494 --> 00:20:31,754
You think he's okay?

337
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:34,324
He said he wouldn't die.

338
00:20:34,424 --> 00:20:35,524
Let's go.

339
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,224
Yeah, you're right.

340
00:20:40,764 --> 00:20:42,504
That dog ain't out here, right?

341
00:20:42,504 --> 00:20:44,174
No, it's not.

342
00:20:44,174 --> 00:20:46,774
Man, I am SO tired!

343
00:20:46,774 --> 00:20:48,504
Thank you for
the delivery

344
00:20:49,174 --> 00:20:50,404
Okay, goodnight.

345
00:20:50,644 --> 00:20:52,014
Goodnight.

346
00:20:53,284 --> 00:20:58,124
The train will soon arrive at Platform 3.

347
00:20:58,124 --> 00:20:59,854
For your safety, please stand and wait inside the white line.

348
00:20:59,854 --> 00:21:01,784
Yuko-chan!

349
00:21:02,024 --> 00:21:03,714
See you soon!

350
00:21:03,824 --> 00:21:06,024
Okay. See you!

351
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:28,084
I'm sure glad everyone was there for me today.

352
00:21:33,524 --> 00:21:35,954
I forgot it again!

353
00:21:59,414 --> 00:22:04,654
Akane ni narabu seitaka kageboushi

354
00:22:04,654 --> 00:22:11,614
Tanoshii ichinichi no owari

355
00:22:13,464 --> 00:22:20,634
Tsukinai oshaberi mada mada aru keredo

356
00:22:20,634 --> 00:22:27,974
Sorosoro o-uchi ni kaeranakucha

357
00:22:27,974 --> 00:22:31,274
Jaa ne, ashita ne

358
00:22:31,514 --> 00:22:34,814
Mail suru kara

359
00:22:35,184 --> 00:22:42,454
Kyou no page ni minna osoroi no egao

360
00:22:42,454 --> 00:22:45,754

361
00:22:46,124 --> 00:22:49,424

Tsugi no kado de furimukinagara bye-bye

365
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:27,564
In the end, it was all a big waste.
And the memories are SUPER scary.

366
00:23:28,134 --> 00:23:30,164
I can't sleep at all.

367
00:23:33,104 --> 00:23:38,044
At my age, I can't tell my parents,
"Let's sleep together"...

368
00:23:42,384 --> 00:23:43,444
Oh!

369
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:49,014
It's been a while since we've slept together, huh?

370
00:23:50,624 --> 00:23:52,094
Goodnight.

371
00:23:55,564 --> 00:23:57,564
yup!

372
00:23:57,564 --> 00:24:00,304
Miporin, what about the
summer festivals is most fun for you?

373
00:24:00,304 --> 00:24:02,734
More than anything, it's the fireworks.

374
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:03,804
Ah.

375
00:24:03,804 --> 00:24:07,704
And takoyaki. Okonomiyaki.
Oh, and soft drinks, too!

376
00:24:07,704 --> 00:24:09,444
Whoa, all very nice!

377
00:24:09,444 --> 00:24:10,944
What do you like, Yutaka?

378
00:24:10,944 --> 00:24:13,714
Me, well, I like the outdoor stalls where-

379
00:24:13,714 --> 00:24:15,514
