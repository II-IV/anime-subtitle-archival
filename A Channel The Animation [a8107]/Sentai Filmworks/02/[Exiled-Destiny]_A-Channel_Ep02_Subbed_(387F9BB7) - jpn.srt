00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:06,294
Run! Get a move on!
Toru-chan's waiting for you.

2
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:08,664
Okaaaaaay.

3
00:00:10,604 --> 00:00:12,574
You haven't forgotten anything?

4
00:00:13,004 --> 00:00:14,744
I'm fine.

5
00:00:14,744 --> 00:00:16,304
Be careful, okay?

6
00:00:16,414 --> 00:00:19,174
Yeah. See you later.

7
00:00:20,714 --> 00:00:22,484
Sorry for the wait.

8
00:00:23,214 --> 00:00:25,054
Good morning, Run-chan.

RAINY DAYS
CALL FOR BATHS

23
00:02:05,984 --> 00:02:08,354
Oh, really?

24
00:02:08,354 --> 00:02:12,024
Huh? I e-mailed you about it
after dinner last night.

25
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:15,254
Really? I didn't see that mail!

26
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:17,834
Run-chan?

27
00:02:19,134 --> 00:02:20,464
Your sock.

28
00:02:22,504 --> 00:02:25,064
I forgot to put the other one on!

29
00:02:26,974 --> 00:02:29,064
How embarrassing!

30
00:02:30,714 --> 00:02:33,974
I'm better off just going barefoot.

31
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:47,864
R-R-R-Run... P-P-P...

32
00:02:48,594 --> 00:02:49,994
Your panties?

33
00:02:56,634 --> 00:03:00,344
I can't believe I didn't notice! I didn't notice!

34
00:03:00,344 --> 00:03:02,974
No squatting! You can see from the front!

35
00:03:03,814 --> 00:03:06,744
Because I was sleepy? That's my only reason?

36
00:03:06,744 --> 00:03:07,684
It's all right. Everyone forgets things.
Because I was sleepy? That's my only reason?

37
00:03:07,684 --> 00:03:10,744
It's all right. Everyone forgets things.
Things like this can happen? I'm so...

38
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,954
But not panties, normally.

39
00:03:13,954 --> 00:03:16,154
Toru. Just now...

40
00:03:16,424 --> 00:03:20,494
Just now... you thought
"Not panties," didn't you?!

41
00:03:20,494 --> 00:03:22,934
Run-chan! You mustn't run!

42
00:03:29,734 --> 00:03:33,474
Again? That's tough for you too, Toru.

43
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,244
Sorry, Toru.

44
00:03:38,814 --> 00:03:42,254
I really can't do mornings.

45
00:03:42,484 --> 00:03:44,914
I'm tired and I just space out...

46
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,554
So that's the problem?

47
00:03:46,554 --> 00:03:48,524
She already put some on.

48
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:54,654
Ah! Yeah, naturally, right?
But I thought, just maybe...

49
00:03:55,664 --> 00:03:57,004
Oh, say, Run.

50
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:58,364
What?

51
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:02,674
Can I make copies of your notes
from yesterday's afternoon classes?

52
00:04:02,674 --> 00:04:06,874
Oh, you left early yesterday, didn't you? Sure.

53
00:04:07,344 --> 00:04:08,544
Here.

54
00:04:08,544 --> 00:04:09,774
Thank you.

55
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,214
You're a big help.

56
00:04:16,414 --> 00:04:17,524
What language is this?

57
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:20,254
Oh, c'mon, it's Japanese.

58
00:04:20,254 --> 00:04:22,784
But the sleep demon came after me during class.

59
00:04:22,954 --> 00:04:25,084
So it's NOT just mornings!

60
00:04:25,394 --> 00:04:27,634
It might be a little messy...

61
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,754
N-No, not at all.

62
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:32,664
Thank you.

63
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:35,104
Tell me if you can't read something, okay?

64
00:04:35,474 --> 00:04:36,874
Huh?!

65
00:04:39,374 --> 00:04:40,304
Here.

66
00:04:40,474 --> 00:04:41,814
Thank you!

67
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:45,214
Say, Yuko-chan, show me
that when you're done.

68
00:04:46,514 --> 00:04:49,674
Sure. Give that to Run once you've made copies.

69
00:04:49,984 --> 00:04:50,954
Okay.

70
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,154
Now then...

71
00:04:53,154 --> 00:04:54,644
Hey.

72
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:58,224
Are you nearsighted? What's your eyesight?

73
00:04:59,264 --> 00:05:02,964
I have 20/10 vision. These are cosmetic glasses.

74
00:05:02,964 --> 00:05:05,294
Huh? Why d'ya wear cosmetic glasses?

75
00:05:05,964 --> 00:05:11,304
Because if I don't, I see things
that I shouldn't see.

76
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:15,374
Don't tell me you mean...

77
00:05:15,644 --> 00:05:19,374
Yes. Behind you right now, Yuko.

78
00:05:21,414 --> 00:05:22,544
No, that's a lie.

79
00:05:24,154 --> 00:05:26,284
It was only a joke.

80
00:05:29,024 --> 00:05:31,524
You sure make fooling you worthwhile.

81
00:05:31,524 --> 00:05:33,294
I'm just nearsighted.

82
00:05:33,294 --> 00:05:36,784
Cut that out! I ain't good with scary stories!

83
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:41,464
I was surprised, too!
Nagi-chan, you're a good actress.

84
00:05:41,704 --> 00:05:44,244
You could be in the drama club.

85
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,404
I am.

86
00:05:46,074 --> 00:05:47,474
Even though I'm a ghost.

87
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,144
Well done!

88
00:05:49,144 --> 00:05:50,134
Not!
Well done!

89
00:05:57,324 --> 00:06:00,394
Note: an excerpt from Kokoro written by Natsume Soseki,
from the official 1957 translation
"I received two or three letters from you this summer."

90
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:01,654
"I received two or three letters from you this summer."

91
00:06:02,624 --> 00:06:07,994
"If I remember rightly, it was in your second letter
that you asked me to help you find a suitable post."

92
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:09,994
I wanna go to the bathroom...
"If I remember rightly, it was in your second letter
that you asked me to help you find a suitable post."

93
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:10,964
"If I remember rightly, it was in your second letter
that you asked me to help you find a suitable post."

94
00:06:11,734 --> 00:06:13,704
Um, sir!

95
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:15,574
What's the matter?

96
00:06:15,574 --> 00:06:18,094
Uh, well...

97
00:06:18,904 --> 00:06:22,744
Oh, no! I can't say I gotta go to the bathroom!
That's way embarrassing!

98
00:06:23,344 --> 00:06:26,814
Um, my head hurts...

99
00:06:26,814 --> 00:06:28,784
Yuko... That's your STOMACH.

100
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:31,724
I mean, um...

101
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,514
Sir, excuse me!

102
00:06:33,924 --> 00:06:39,884
I'd like to go to the restroom, so may I take
Yuko-chan by the nurse's office on my way?

103
00:06:39,994 --> 00:06:41,294
Yeah. Do it.

104
00:06:41,394 --> 00:06:42,394
Run...

105
00:06:42,394 --> 00:06:44,134
Let's go, Yuko-chan!

106
00:06:44,134 --> 00:06:45,824
Yeah!

107
00:06:48,704 --> 00:06:51,934
I-I'm sorry. You really helped me out, Run.

108
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:55,374
It's fine. I needed to go, too.

109
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,274
Huh? To the bathroom?

110
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,444
No...

111
00:07:03,884 --> 00:07:05,644
The nurse's office.

112
00:07:05,924 --> 00:07:07,114
Run!

113
00:07:08,754 --> 00:07:11,054
Run, what's the matter?

114
00:07:11,524 --> 00:07:12,924
Is somethin' wrong?

115
00:07:12,924 --> 00:07:16,164
I don't know, but I feel sick somehow.

116
00:07:16,164 --> 00:07:18,964
I think something's the matter with...

117
00:07:19,164 --> 00:07:20,204
I'm gonna puke!

118
00:07:20,204 --> 00:07:23,634
You need a toilet? Or the nurse's office?

119
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:25,004
No, a toilet!

120
00:07:25,004 --> 00:07:29,074
A toil... To... To... To?

121
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,374
Oh! TORU!

122
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:32,844
Yuko-chan!

123
00:07:32,844 --> 00:07:34,544
No, that's not...

124
00:07:37,384 --> 00:07:38,944
Nurse's
Office

125
00:07:39,254 --> 00:07:40,984
Run! Hey!

126
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,524
Run! Hang in there.

127
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,194
Yuko.

128
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:46,764
You in there?

129
00:07:46,764 --> 00:07:50,364
Toru! Run suddenly fainted!

130
00:07:50,364 --> 00:07:54,104
And the nurse ain't in today! What do we do?!

131
00:07:54,104 --> 00:07:57,164
Just calm down. We can
get hold of one of the teachers.

132
00:07:57,274 --> 00:07:59,404
Both of you, stay quiet.

133
00:08:00,674 --> 00:08:02,204
It's all right.

134
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,654
She just hasn't gotten enough sleep.

135
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:26,394
Calmly
and
Quietly

136
00:08:32,974 --> 00:08:34,164
Rain...

137
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,014
I have no umbrella.

138
00:08:36,014 --> 00:08:39,314
Me neither. It was sunny this morning!

139
00:08:39,314 --> 00:08:42,074
But it's only drizzling. Will we be fine if we run?

140
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:45,584
Wait, Toru. Watch this!

141
00:08:45,684 --> 00:08:47,084
Aoigaoka
High School

142
00:08:50,894 --> 00:08:53,524
I discovered this recently: I'm a rain woman!

143
00:08:53,524 --> 00:08:55,134
Note: Rain woman is a Japanese spirit/monster who is a bringer of rain.
In modern Japanese, it refers to someone who is seemingly jinxed
as a rain-bringer that ruins events, etc.

I'm all wet!

148
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:04,364
Jeez, don't be so reckless.

149
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,904
Who's that? He's staring over here.

150
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:18,674
Even though Run-chan
looks like THAT right now.

151
00:09:19,484 --> 00:09:20,514
Run-chan.

152
00:09:21,254 --> 00:09:22,654
Let's go over there.

153
00:09:22,654 --> 00:09:23,784
Yeah.

154
00:09:30,664 --> 00:09:31,594
Good.

155
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:37,464
How nice... And at this school.

156
00:09:39,144 --> 00:09:41,634
SUBMIT PERMISSION SLIPS FOR THE SCHOOL
RETREAT TO YOUR TEACHER OR YAMADA.
WHAT A
PAIN...

157
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:43,934
Run, you have to hurry and dry off.

158
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,814
Okay, finished!

159
00:09:47,484 --> 00:09:49,244
Toru, wear this.

160
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:50,854
GAB HSART

161
00:09:50,854 --> 00:09:52,384
Ta-daa!
GAB HSART

162
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:52,974
GAB HSART

163
00:09:53,424 --> 00:09:55,754
With this, we don't need an umbrella!

164
00:09:56,254 --> 00:10:01,724
At our age, this is a bit much. If we were
in elementary school, maybe, but...

165
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:05,934
Ah, true enough, the "pair look" is a bit much.

166
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:08,104
So maybe just one of us should...

167
00:10:08,104 --> 00:10:10,264
No, that's not the issue.

168
00:10:12,004 --> 00:10:13,494
The heck is that?

169
00:10:13,644 --> 00:10:13,944
Fine, then I'll strip. I'm gonna get wet anyway.

170
00:10:13,944 --> 00:10:15,674
Wh-What?
Fine, then I'll strip. I'm gonna get wet anyway.

171
00:10:15,674 --> 00:10:16,814
Fine, then I'll strip. I'm gonna get wet anyway.

172
00:10:16,814 --> 00:10:16,874
I'LL strip.

173
00:10:16,874 --> 00:10:17,534
Wanna go?
I'LL strip.

174
00:10:18,814 --> 00:10:20,904
Nagi-chan! Yuko-chan!

175
00:10:21,714 --> 00:10:23,614
Stay back!

176
00:10:25,884 --> 00:10:29,924
Jeez. I wondered what you guys were up to...

177
00:10:29,924 --> 00:10:31,624
Run, you're soaking wet!

178
00:10:32,024 --> 00:10:34,664
My house is close by.
Why not come dry your clothes?

179
00:10:34,664 --> 00:10:36,934
Really? Thank you.

180
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:38,624
But it's still...

181
00:10:40,404 --> 00:10:41,734
Whoa.

182
00:10:42,104 --> 00:10:44,234
I wonder if we've got a rain jinx at our school.

183
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:48,274
So, what do we do?

184
00:10:48,574 --> 00:10:51,204
It's really coming down,
but we'll be fine if we run.

185
00:10:51,814 --> 00:10:54,804
No one's afraid of getting wet, right?

186
00:10:56,454 --> 00:10:58,684
Well, if it's as far as Nagi's house...

187
00:10:58,684 --> 00:11:00,314
What a pain.

188
00:11:00,854 --> 00:11:03,084
I don't want to get wet, so let's call a taxi.

189
00:11:03,794 --> 00:11:06,024
How un-high school student-like!

190
00:11:09,094 --> 00:11:10,894
I wonder if it'll stop if wait...

191
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:12,334
Doesn't look good.

192
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:13,904
So we should call a taxi-

193
00:11:13,904 --> 00:11:15,064
Go!

194
00:11:15,304 --> 00:11:17,004
Nagi-chan, your house is this way, right?

195
00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:18,044
Hey, what the!

196
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,434
Wait, me too!

197
00:11:20,504 --> 00:11:21,874
Wait up, idiot!

198
00:11:21,874 --> 00:11:22,814
C'mon, c'mon!

199
00:11:22,814 --> 00:11:25,744
Wait up! Don't leave me!

200
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:31,444
Rain makes me a little depressed,
yet they're having such fun...

201
00:11:34,024 --> 00:11:35,544
Aah, youth!

I'm home.

Pardon the intrusion!

210
00:11:57,944 --> 00:12:01,904
Yeah, go on in. Let's hurry and take a bath.

211
00:12:02,954 --> 00:12:05,254
Huh? Big Bro is home.

212
00:12:05,254 --> 00:12:07,844
Nagi, you've got a big brother?

213
00:12:09,054 --> 00:12:12,354
Brother! I brought some friends over!

214
00:12:12,624 --> 00:12:15,254
So don't use the washroom, okay?

215
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:21,534
Nagi-chan, do you call your big brother "Bro"?
Or do you call him "Brother"?

216
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:22,004
Note: Nagi tries to cultivate a tough-girl image; aniki (Bro) sounds
kinda tough, while oniichan (Big Brother) sounds cutesy.

B-Bro, of course!

Now then...

221
00:12:25,804 --> 00:12:26,604
Now then...

222
00:12:26,904 --> 00:12:30,074
Only two people can fit in the tub at once.

223
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:32,714
So we're making pairs.

224
00:12:32,944 --> 00:12:35,244
Here goes. One, two...

225
00:12:37,154 --> 00:12:39,244
Okay, Run and I go first.

226
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:42,144
See you! Well, let's change.

227
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,624
There we go.

228
00:13:03,744 --> 00:13:04,734
That's right!

229
00:13:04,844 --> 00:13:10,254
Come to think of it, Toru and me
ain't never talked one on one!

230
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,424
What should I do?!

231
00:13:14,524 --> 00:13:18,514
Silence at a time like this is kinda... kinda!

232
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,194
Yuko.

233
00:13:22,194 --> 00:13:23,334
Yes?!

234
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:27,894
Should I put something on?
She has lots of DVDs.

235
00:13:28,004 --> 00:13:29,494
O-oh, yeah.

236
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:31,304
SCARY URBAN LEGENDS
That Really Happened

237
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:38,274
"Scary Urban Legends That Really Happened"
or SILENCE. Which do you prefer?

238
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,604
That's an extreme choice!

239
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,374
Put your clothes down over there.

240
00:13:44,584 --> 00:13:46,574
Okay. Here, right?

241
00:13:46,954 --> 00:13:49,284
Well, let's hurry and get in.

242
00:13:49,994 --> 00:13:51,014
Whoa! Who're you?!

243
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:54,024
It's me, Run.

244
00:13:56,534 --> 00:14:02,064
Yeah, I know that.
Still, something very simple can...

245
00:14:03,474 --> 00:14:05,374
Really change things.

246
00:14:12,244 --> 00:14:13,744
Who're you?!

247
00:14:13,744 --> 00:14:16,614
I'm bored of that reaction.

248
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:23,854
It sure feels good, right?

249
00:14:24,194 --> 00:14:25,824
Refreshing, isn't it?

250
00:14:25,994 --> 00:14:29,494
Yeah. Still, we should get out soon, huh?

251
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:34,024
That's right. We have to hurry
and let Toru and Yuko-chan go.

252
00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:39,874
It's just the two of them alone in my room.
I wonder if they're okay.

253
00:14:40,344 --> 00:14:44,544
They're okay! The two of them get along.

254
00:14:44,544 --> 00:14:46,044
Well...

255
00:14:46,044 --> 00:14:48,674
Yeah, but...

256
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:08,364
Game over! Game over!
At this rate, it's game over!

257
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:12,264
Oh! It's not scary if I close my eyes.

258
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,714
I wanna scream!

259
00:15:26,054 --> 00:15:27,594
Sorry for the wait.

260
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,284
Okay, the bath is...

261
00:15:30,294 --> 00:15:32,764
Hey, Yuko? The bathtub is free.

262
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:34,924
Yuko-chan.

263
00:15:35,464 --> 00:15:37,324
Yuko-chan?

264
00:15:37,664 --> 00:15:38,964
Yuko-chan!

265
00:15:39,734 --> 00:15:43,274
Yuko-chan? Yuko-chan! Oh no, Yuko-chan!

266
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:44,894
What the heck happened?

267
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:49,274
Wow... That was REALLY scary.

268
00:15:49,974 --> 00:15:52,674
Finally we can take a bath. Right, Toru?

269
00:15:53,144 --> 00:15:54,374
Yeah.

270
00:15:56,384 --> 00:15:58,014
Well, wanna go in?

271
00:16:04,894 --> 00:16:05,994
Hey...

272
00:16:05,994 --> 00:16:11,394
You ever gotten scared when you're washing
your bangs and you can't see?

273
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:19,534
Me, I really couldn't stand shampoo
when I was a kid.

274
00:16:25,014 --> 00:16:26,274
I got shampoo in my eyes!

275
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:30,884
What're you doin', Toru?!
Where's the shower head?

276
00:16:30,884 --> 00:16:34,374
My eyes... My eyes!

277
00:16:36,724 --> 00:16:38,494
Dammit, Yuko!

278
00:16:38,494 --> 00:16:40,424
Shut up already!

279
00:16:40,424 --> 00:16:42,524
Look, stop it!

280
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,804
Jeez...

281
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,394
I thought I was gonna stop breathing.

282
00:17:00,044 --> 00:17:04,214
Aah. Consciousness is growing dim...

283
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:09,084
Run, look: You can see an oasis.

284
00:17:09,924 --> 00:17:12,484
Nagi! Run!

285
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:15,734
What're you two doin'?!

286
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,394
Yuko...

287
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:20,904
H-how was the bathwater?

288
00:17:20,904 --> 00:17:22,234
Don't worry about that!

289
00:17:23,374 --> 00:17:26,104
Um, just turn off the heater.

290
00:17:26,544 --> 00:17:29,534
I thought we'd... dry our clothes...

291
00:17:33,284 --> 00:17:34,814
It's delicious!

292
00:17:34,814 --> 00:17:36,784
Ah, I'm back to life!

293
00:17:36,784 --> 00:17:38,944
Jeez, don't scare us like that.

294
00:17:40,584 --> 00:17:42,284
They've gotten pretty dry.

295
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,324
I wonder if it'll stop raining soon...

296
00:17:46,194 --> 00:17:47,954
Doesn't look like it yet.

297
00:17:48,394 --> 00:17:50,564
It sure is raining.

298
00:17:50,564 --> 00:17:53,204
Rainy days always do your hair in, huh?

299
00:17:53,204 --> 00:17:56,224
Mine always gets kinda limp.

300
00:17:56,434 --> 00:17:59,804
Mine fans out, and I can't tame it at all.

301
00:17:59,804 --> 00:18:02,364
Maybe we have different hair types...

302
00:18:03,244 --> 00:18:05,504
Let me touch your hair, Yuko-chan.

303
00:18:05,614 --> 00:18:07,014
Sure. No problem.

304
00:18:09,284 --> 00:18:10,954
Yuko-chan, your hair's so pretty!

305
00:18:10,954 --> 00:18:12,014
Toru.

306
00:18:12,924 --> 00:18:13,724
You don't have any split ends at all.

307
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:14,784
Wanna play?
You don't have any split ends at all.

308
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,554
Oh, that's not true!

309
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,914
These clothes are cute, huh?

310
00:18:38,914 --> 00:18:42,574
Don't move! This is the important part!

311
00:18:44,554 --> 00:18:45,674
Okay.

312
00:18:45,884 --> 00:18:47,084
Yes, yes.

313
00:18:50,854 --> 00:18:52,294
Wh-what gives?

314
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:53,654
Don't move!

315
00:18:58,564 --> 00:19:01,364
I lost!

316
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:04,604
Gonna play again?

317
00:19:04,604 --> 00:19:06,544
I'll make Nagi a new high score.

318
00:19:07,304 --> 00:19:09,404
That's nice of you.

319
00:19:11,714 --> 00:19:12,904
Hup!

320
00:19:13,644 --> 00:19:16,554
Yuko, your fingers are surprisingly pretty.

321
00:19:16,554 --> 00:19:18,724
Th-that's not true.

322
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,824
Do you take care of them somehow?

323
00:19:20,824 --> 00:19:22,854
No, I don't really do anything.

324
00:19:22,854 --> 00:19:25,014
All right. In that case...

325
00:19:25,924 --> 00:19:27,294
Ta-daa!

326
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:36,094
That feels good, but...
I-I feel embarrassed somehow.

327
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:42,074
T-Toru! Hey!

328
00:19:43,914 --> 00:19:44,214
Don't you move!

329
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:45,074
Don't move!
Don't you move!

330
00:19:46,944 --> 00:19:50,814
Jeez! What should I do?!

331
00:19:57,224 --> 00:20:03,964
Houkago yotei mo nanmo nai shi

332
00:20:03,964 --> 00:20:05,104
Looks like it still won't stop.
