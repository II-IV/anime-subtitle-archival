1
00:00:06,704 --> 00:00:08,034
It's summer...

2
00:00:10,004 --> 00:00:11,264
I wanna die.

3
00:00:11,504 --> 00:00:13,744
You sure are gloomy, Toru!

4
00:00:13,744 --> 00:00:16,734
Seaside Resorts
It's summer, so we should go
to the beach! Right?

5
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:21,914
I don't want to show this scrawny body in public.

6
00:00:21,914 --> 00:00:24,724
Oh, come on! You worry too much.

7
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:29,284
Everyone has their unique qualities.
You just have to use yours!

8
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,794
Run-chan...

9
00:00:31,964 --> 00:00:34,264
For the fetishists out there.

10
00:00:34,864 --> 00:00:36,624
That I didn't need!

11
00:00:48,944 --> 00:00:51,844
Cloudy and ephemeral

12
00:00:51,844 --> 00:01:00,594
Becoming one with the glittering, faraway sky

13
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:08,694
My wind-reading, willful destination is far away

14
00:01:09,234 --> 00:01:12,364
Let's go together

15
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:18,064
I'll inhale deeply and go, the world's spring breath

16
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:23,474
The smiling faces of everyone gathered in the sun

17
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:30,924
In between "Good morning" and
"Goodbye," there is only us

18
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,484
We can do anything, can't we?

19
00:01:34,854 --> 00:01:40,594
Transparent beams of sunlight, a newborn sky

20
00:01:40,794 --> 00:01:46,704
A morning arch at which we promised to meet

21
00:01:46,704 --> 00:01:54,204
To you, waving your hand, I'll give a special today

22
00:01:54,374 --> 00:01:57,604
And the talking will begin

23
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:09,694
Ta-daa!

24
00:02:09,694 --> 00:02:12,184
I bought a swimsuit just for you, Toru!

25
00:02:14,194 --> 00:02:18,464
I chose the smallest size they had.
Now we can go to the beach!

26
00:02:19,064 --> 00:02:20,264
Here.

27
00:02:23,134 --> 00:02:26,704
It's sure to look great. C'mon, try it on!

28
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,374
Yeah.

29
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:31,874
It's perfect!

30
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:36,974
But it's a little... loose.

31
00:02:40,254 --> 00:02:44,214
Hey, everyone! I got us some ice cream. Um...

32
00:02:45,594 --> 00:02:46,654
Huh?

33
00:02:47,864 --> 00:02:50,234
Toru, it's ice cream!

34
00:02:50,434 --> 00:02:52,904
I-I-I can't eat a-a-anything now.

35
00:02:52,904 --> 00:02:55,034
Say, what's wrong with Toru?

36
00:02:55,034 --> 00:02:57,274
Well, she's sort of...

37
00:02:57,274 --> 00:03:00,244
Oh! This is the flavor that
came out this year, right?

38
00:03:00,244 --> 00:03:02,044
I've been wanting to try this.

39
00:03:02,044 --> 00:03:04,134
Me too, so that's why I got it.

40
00:03:04,344 --> 00:03:05,984
What a coincidence.

41
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:07,814
We should split it.

42
00:03:08,114 --> 00:03:09,084
Yeah!

43
00:03:12,154 --> 00:03:13,584
Actually, I CAN eat!

44
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:18,454
Wh...

45
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:20,854
Why're you naked?

46
00:03:22,964 --> 00:03:24,304
Toru Nagi
A-CHANNEL
Yuko
Run

47
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,974
THE BEACH

48
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,834
PE
Math I
Jpn Eng I PE

49
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,534
POOL!

50
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,504
It's the pool!

51
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,074
You sure changed fast!

52
00:03:36,244 --> 00:03:36,374
Pool! Pool! Pool! Pool! Pool! Pool!

53
00:03:36,374 --> 00:03:41,844
You're a high-schooler now, but you still like
getting worked up over the pool, don't you?
Pool! Pool! Pool! Pool! Pool! Pool!

54
00:03:42,254 --> 00:03:46,014
What are you saying?
Summer is all about the pool!

55
00:03:46,324 --> 00:03:48,194
You haven't forgotten this is CLASS, have you?

56
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,194
A pool's a pool!

57
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:51,194
Huh?

58
00:03:51,194 --> 00:03:54,764
Toru, your swimsuit is a different color here.

59
00:03:54,764 --> 00:03:56,094
Is this a hand-me-down?

60
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,254
This is...

61
00:03:59,434 --> 00:04:02,334
I've been using it since elementary school.

62
00:04:04,104 --> 00:04:05,004
Ow!

63
00:04:09,974 --> 00:04:12,244
Hey! That's dangerous!

64
00:04:12,484 --> 00:04:15,314
Floating sure feels good.

65
00:04:15,914 --> 00:04:18,284
Yutaka, your breasts are so big...

66
00:04:18,684 --> 00:04:20,674
Oh, you think?

67
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:25,324
It must be nice to have all that fat
to help you float easily.

68
00:04:25,664 --> 00:04:29,064
Someone's got claws. You jealous?

69
00:04:29,064 --> 00:04:31,094
N-not at all!

70
00:04:43,244 --> 00:04:44,944
Zero fat!

71
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:50,314
It's so hot!

72
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,914
PE in summer sure is tough.

73
00:04:59,324 --> 00:05:01,794
The first-years have pool, huh?

74
00:05:01,794 --> 00:05:03,924
Ah! That's Toru!

75
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:07,294
You're right. That pool looks cool...

76
00:05:15,944 --> 00:05:17,774
Okay, gather 'round.

77
00:05:20,314 --> 00:05:21,684
Must be nice.

78
00:05:22,884 --> 00:05:24,454
I'm jealous.

79
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:27,444
What gives, Nagi? Don't you hate pools?

80
00:05:27,854 --> 00:05:32,794
I DO hate pools. Rather,
I don't like wearing swimsuits.

81
00:05:33,194 --> 00:05:34,184
But!

82
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,164
Toru!

83
00:05:36,494 --> 00:05:39,534
Splash water on me!
Grab a bucket and douse me!

84
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:41,734
The heat's done Nagi in!

85
00:05:43,074 --> 00:05:43,704
Quit it, Nagi!

86
00:05:43,704 --> 00:05:44,974
Let go! Let go!
Quit it, Nagi!

87
00:05:44,974 --> 00:05:46,874
Toru! Water! Water!

88
00:05:46,874 --> 00:05:48,464
Aah, whatever.

89
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:51,284
Huh? The beach?

90
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:55,884
Yeah! Summer vacation
starts next week, so let's all go!

91
00:05:55,884 --> 00:05:57,014
Agreed!

92
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,514
Huh?

93
00:05:59,854 --> 00:06:02,154
I don't have a swimsuit I can wear to the beach.

94
00:06:03,094 --> 00:06:05,024
I don't want to wear a swimsuit.

95
00:06:05,524 --> 00:06:09,154
What're the two of you sayin'?
That can't be right!

96
00:06:11,134 --> 00:06:13,794
Wh-what?

97
00:06:14,734 --> 00:06:18,804
Did you hear that? "Because I have a nice body!"

98
00:06:18,804 --> 00:06:20,244
"Because I have fair skin!"

99
00:06:20,444 --> 00:06:22,544
What're you sayin'?

100
00:06:22,544 --> 00:06:24,514
That's not it at all!

101
00:06:24,644 --> 00:06:26,944
Oh, such modesty.

102
00:06:27,184 --> 00:06:28,654
Come on!

103
00:06:29,654 --> 00:06:32,884
I wanna go to the beach, all of us!

104
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,554
Thank you very much.

105
00:06:39,164 --> 00:06:41,684
All this walking around has made me hot!

106
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:44,004
Sorry for makin' you come along.

107
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,234
No, I bought one, too.

108
00:06:46,234 --> 00:06:48,134
Wanna rest somewhere?

109
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:51,564
Huh? Nagi?

110
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:55,474
What's wrong? You feelin' bad?

111
00:06:55,774 --> 00:06:58,744
The cold air collects here. It's cool!

112
00:06:58,944 --> 00:07:00,484
I'm resting HERE.

113
00:07:00,484 --> 00:07:04,974
Hey! Nagi, stand up! Please!

114
00:07:08,754 --> 00:07:10,554
That girl just now is big, huh?

115
00:07:11,294 --> 00:07:13,724
More than 170 cm, right?

116
00:07:14,464 --> 00:07:17,594
Sure enough, people think of me
as a big woman...

117
00:07:17,864 --> 00:07:23,274
They're jealous. Yuko, you're tall,
slender and big-breasted.

118
00:07:23,374 --> 00:07:25,474
The breasts make it worse.

119
00:07:25,474 --> 00:07:28,244
Just being like THIS is bad enough.

120
00:07:28,244 --> 00:07:29,914
Really? Oh.

121
00:07:29,914 --> 00:07:30,584
Lingerie

122
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:32,204
Lingerie
These are good bras, huh?

123
00:07:32,444 --> 00:07:34,574
They're cheap, so maybe I'll get one.

124
00:07:35,514 --> 00:07:38,384
You're right. I'd like one, too.

125
00:07:39,854 --> 00:07:40,924
What's the matter?

126
00:07:40,924 --> 00:07:41,094
Lingerie
What's the matter?

127
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:41,824
Lingerie
They only go up to a D cup.

128
00:07:41,824 --> 00:07:42,694
Limited stock
They only go up to a D cup.

129
00:07:42,694 --> 00:07:43,884
Limited stock
Sizes B - D only
They only go up to a D cup.

130
00:07:44,224 --> 00:07:47,194
Sure enough, smaller ones are more convenient.

131
00:07:53,464 --> 00:07:55,404
Let's hurry up and go.

132
00:07:55,404 --> 00:07:57,404
Say, let's take a look.

133
00:07:57,404 --> 00:08:01,174
What the heck? We already decided we're not
going to the beach, right?!

134
00:08:01,174 --> 00:08:03,444
Where's the harm? They're cute.

135
00:08:04,814 --> 00:08:07,004
I'm not buying anything.

136
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,554
Hiii!

137
00:08:22,094 --> 00:08:23,324
Nagi!

138
00:08:24,164 --> 00:08:25,734
How 'bout this?

139
00:08:25,734 --> 00:08:26,664
Yeah, it's good.

140
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:29,904
Really? I'm gonna try these on, so let me know.

141
00:08:29,904 --> 00:08:30,874
Okay.

142
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:33,644
How is it?

143
00:08:33,644 --> 00:08:34,874
Perfect.

144
00:08:34,874 --> 00:08:37,074
Really? Okay...

145
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:41,644
And this one?

146
00:08:41,884 --> 00:08:43,284
It's just right.

147
00:08:43,484 --> 00:08:44,784
Okay...

148
00:08:47,254 --> 00:08:48,554
How 'bout THIS one?

149
00:08:48,554 --> 00:08:50,024
Spot on.

150
00:08:50,024 --> 00:08:53,924
Aah, I can't choose! I'm gonna try another one.

151
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,444
Give me a minute, okay?

152
00:09:07,444 --> 00:09:08,434
Yeah.

153
00:09:29,564 --> 00:09:30,654
Okay!

154
00:09:32,464 --> 00:09:35,134
Nagi, sorry for the wait. Huh?

155
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:50,284
No! I'm just, that is!

156
00:09:50,284 --> 00:09:52,084
I just wanted to look.

157
00:09:57,224 --> 00:09:58,984
I'll try some on.

158
00:10:00,664 --> 00:10:02,134
I bought one...

159
00:10:02,494 --> 00:10:05,054
So what? It looks great on you!

160
00:10:05,634 --> 00:10:07,004
Thank you.

161
00:10:07,004 --> 00:10:08,234
Oh!

162
00:10:09,534 --> 00:10:10,644
A text?

163
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:13,904
Yup, to Run and Toru. "Let's go to the beach!"

164
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,074
Looking forward to it, huh?

165
00:10:26,354 --> 00:10:27,784
Two kilograms to go...

166
00:10:28,124 --> 00:10:29,524
Impossible, huh?

167
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:32,124
Run said "Okay"!

168
00:10:33,824 --> 00:10:35,024
I'm home.

169
00:10:35,194 --> 00:10:36,694
Welcome back.

170
00:10:36,694 --> 00:10:38,564
Run-chan came over a little while ago.

171
00:10:38,564 --> 00:10:40,464
Did she already leave?

172
00:10:40,464 --> 00:10:43,804
Yes. She said she came to drop something off.

173
00:10:57,084 --> 00:11:01,544
This is an old swimsuit of mine.
I think it'll be perfect for you!

174
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:23,274
I'll race you to that island, Toru.

175
00:11:26,514 --> 00:11:29,574
Play hard and study hard.

176
00:11:29,784 --> 00:11:35,384
I look forward to seeing you all again,
reenergized for the new semester.

177
00:11:39,964 --> 00:11:44,924
Summer
vacation!!

178
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,164
Wait!

179
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:13,164
The beach! The beach! The beach! The beach!

180
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:14,164
The beach! The beach! The beach!

181
00:12:14,164 --> 00:12:16,024
You a kid?
The beach! The beach! The beach!

182
00:12:21,704 --> 00:12:22,774
The beach!

183
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:23,764
The beach.

184
00:12:27,544 --> 00:12:29,014
Pretty, isn't it?

185
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:39,724
It's running along the street.

186
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:42,154
They have streetcars here, huh?

187
00:12:42,154 --> 00:12:43,524
You're right.

188
00:12:43,524 --> 00:12:46,984
Amazing, right? It runs on the street!

189
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:50,164
I wonder when they traded them out!

190
00:12:50,464 --> 00:12:52,294
What's that?

191
00:12:52,964 --> 00:12:55,134
Well, the tires!

192
00:12:55,134 --> 00:12:57,194
There ARE no tires.

193
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:09,784

194
00:13:10,154 --> 00:13:11,314

The beach!

196
00:13:13,884 --> 00:13:15,894
Well, let's swim!

197
00:13:15,894 --> 00:13:17,724
The beach sure makes me excited!

198
00:13:18,024 --> 00:13:19,794
Me, too!

199
00:13:20,124 --> 00:13:21,494
Run-chan.

200
00:13:22,964 --> 00:13:25,394
Thank you for lending me your swimsuit.

201
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:30,874
Sure. I'm glad it was the right size.
Sorry it's kind of a kiddy design.

202
00:13:30,874 --> 00:13:31,934
No.

203
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:33,804
After all...

204
00:13:33,804 --> 00:13:36,034
I've had that since elementary school!

205
00:13:37,314 --> 00:13:41,274
Hey! What are you doing? Come on, hurry!

206
00:13:41,414 --> 00:13:42,544
Okay!

207
00:13:45,554 --> 00:13:47,814
Elementary school...

208
00:13:56,864 --> 00:13:58,024
Hyaa!

209
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:01,464
Now you've done it!

210
00:14:12,244 --> 00:14:14,734
Jeez, that tickles!

211
00:14:20,154 --> 00:14:20,924
Oh, you're so tall! So tall!

00:14:20,924 --> 00:14:21,894
Note: A game played with (little) children

What are you doing?!

214
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:23,594
What are you doing?!

215
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:25,694
It's fun, huh, Toru?

216
00:14:25,694 --> 00:14:27,684
Put me down!

217
00:14:34,404 --> 00:14:36,464
Toru? Nagi?!

218
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,444
Ow...

219
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:45,044
What's with that hair?!

220
00:14:46,744 --> 00:14:47,884
What?

221
00:14:47,884 --> 00:14:49,004
Seaweed.

222
00:14:52,554 --> 00:14:54,124
Looks good on ya, Nagi!

223
00:14:54,124 --> 00:14:55,254
It looks good!

224
00:14:55,254 --> 00:14:56,744
Seaweed...

225
00:15:06,504 --> 00:15:08,174
I need a timeout.

226
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,944
What gives, Nagi? You tired already?

227
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:15,174
I was up at 5:00 this morning.
I'm about out of energy.

228
00:15:15,174 --> 00:15:17,214
I'm doin' fine.

229
00:15:17,214 --> 00:15:19,144
I'm kinda frail.

230
00:15:19,244 --> 00:15:22,714
Well, let's take a break. I'll go get some drinks.

231
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,954
Oh. I'll take a melon soda, please.

232
00:15:24,954 --> 00:15:25,924

233
00:15:27,654 --> 00:15:27,754

00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:36,584
Sure enough.

238
00:15:37,034 --> 00:15:38,904
She's pretty tired.

00:15:44,134 --> 00:15:45,694
Beach House - Enojima Center
What should we get?

245
00:15:47,174 --> 00:15:50,164

247
00:15:54,954 --> 00:16:01,114

sugar candy soda at a place like this!

248
00:16:01,354 --> 00:16:02,414
Yeah.

249
00:16:02,724 --> 00:16:04,754
Nagi-chan, we got some.

250
00:16:04,924 --> 00:16:05,854
Oh.

251
00:16:06,624 --> 00:16:07,684
Huh?

252
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:10,054
Yuko's asleep.

253
00:16:10,464 --> 00:16:12,204
You're right.

254
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:17,904
Jeez. She only just said "I'm doin' fine,"
but the second she sat down, she was out!

255
00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:19,894
Looks like a good sleep.

256
00:16:20,404 --> 00:16:21,374
Oh!

257
00:16:28,484 --> 00:16:31,544
Mmm, this feels great!

258
00:16:37,154 --> 00:16:41,894
It's quiet and there aren't many people around.
The southern islands are the best!

259
00:16:48,034 --> 00:16:50,064
Huh? What?

260
00:16:51,604 --> 00:16:52,904
Leaves?

261
00:16:54,774 --> 00:16:58,444
What the heck, Toru? That tickles!

262
00:17:02,384 --> 00:17:05,284
Y-you're heavy!

263
00:17:09,754 --> 00:17:13,784
Agh! You're heavy!

264
00:17:17,394 --> 00:17:18,924
A dream?

265
00:17:20,064 --> 00:17:21,664
I was asleep?

266
00:17:30,574 --> 00:17:32,044
A sandcastle?!

267
00:17:32,744 --> 00:17:35,084
Nooo!

268
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:38,484
Don't move. It's almost finished.

269
00:17:38,584 --> 00:17:41,574
Hurry and get this offa me!

270
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:43,914
Hyaa!

271
00:17:45,594 --> 00:17:46,724
Attack!

272
00:17:49,394 --> 00:17:50,294
Here!

273
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,564
Sorry.

274
00:17:53,564 --> 00:17:55,364
No worries!

275
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:07,954
What's the matter?

276
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:10,944
It's like I'm being pulled. It's fun!

277
00:18:24,164 --> 00:18:26,104
Is that really fun?

278
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:29,894
Huh? Nagi?

279
00:18:40,514 --> 00:18:41,844
M-me, too!

280
00:18:53,594 --> 00:18:54,824
Lunch time!

281
00:18:55,664 --> 00:18:58,034
At the beach, it's gotta be ramen, huh?

282
00:18:58,034 --> 00:18:59,064
Yakisoba.

283
00:18:59,064 --> 00:19:01,104
Latin-inspired taco rice.

284
00:19:01,104 --> 00:19:02,834
I packed a boxed lunch.

285
00:19:03,204 --> 00:19:05,104
It's the same as always, huh?

286
00:19:05,104 --> 00:19:06,244
Really?

287
00:19:06,244 --> 00:19:09,104
Not to worry! Leave it to me!

288
00:19:09,714 --> 00:19:11,014
What're you gonna do?

289
00:19:11,014 --> 00:19:13,244
It's the beach, after all. The beach!

290
00:19:15,584 --> 00:19:17,774
Fish!

291
00:19:26,094 --> 00:19:32,554

Let's all come again, okay?

316
00:20:41,634 --> 00:20:42,724
Yeah.

317
00:20:46,544 --> 00:20:48,044

Faster, faster!

320
00:20:53,644 --> 00:20:55,114
We made it.

321
00:20:55,114 --> 00:20:56,884
It's empty, huh?

322
00:21:02,994 --> 00:21:05,264
Yuko, you're not gonna sit?

323
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,524
Uh, no, I'm fine here.

324
00:21:07,764 --> 00:21:09,834
We've got a long way to go.

325
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:12,824
Nah, I've got lots of energy.

326
00:21:20,174 --> 00:21:21,544
You all right, Yuko?

327
00:21:21,874 --> 00:21:23,814
Yeah, looks like it.

328
00:21:23,814 --> 00:21:25,044
Your cuticles!

329
00:21:25,844 --> 00:21:28,684
Are your cuticles all right, Yuko-chan?

330
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:30,014
She can't SEE them, can she?

331
00:21:30,014 --> 00:21:32,114
I think they're okay.

332
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:36,324
You gotta be careful, because
your hair is long and pretty.

333
00:21:36,324 --> 00:21:37,694
And your skin is alabaster.

334
00:21:37,924 --> 00:21:40,024
Uh, thank you.

335
00:21:40,024 --> 00:21:43,094
Oh. I wonder if I got a little darker...

336
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:47,064
No, not to worry. You put sun block on, right?

337
00:21:47,064 --> 00:21:48,964
Oh. What about you, Run?

338
00:21:51,204 --> 00:21:52,944
She didn't get dark at all.

339
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:55,614
Run, what did you use for sun block?

340
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,234
I didn't use any.

341
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,814
You didn't use sun block?
What's up with this skin?

342
00:22:01,814 --> 00:22:03,484
I don't believe it.

343
00:22:03,484 --> 00:22:05,384
That tickles!

344
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:11,384
I don't get darker 'cuz of my genetics!

345
00:22:11,594 --> 00:22:13,024
Really?

346
00:22:13,024 --> 00:22:15,034
What are you, an alien?

347
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:17,064
No, I'm not!

348
00:22:17,064 --> 00:22:18,724
Run is an Earthling.

349
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:19,894
Really?

350
00:22:20,204 --> 00:22:21,494
Really!

351
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:47,024
Silhouettes, taller than us,
line against the madder tree

352
00:22:47,024 --> 00:22:53,994
The end to an enjoyable day

353
00:22:55,834 --> 00:23:03,014
There's lots, lots of this long story left

354
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:10,354
But it's about time I have to get home

355
00:23:10,354 --> 00:23:13,654
Okay, see you tomorrow

356
00:23:13,884 --> 00:23:17,184
I'll e-mail you

357
00:23:17,554 --> 00:23:24,834
On today's page, everyone had matching smiles

358
00:23:24,834 --> 00:23:28,134
Okay, see you tomorrow

359
00:23:28,504 --> 00:23:31,804
Thanks for everything

360
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:40,684
I'm glad we could be together again today

361
00:23:40,684 --> 00:23:47,854
La-la-laa, humming to our hearts and the wind

362
00:23:47,854 --> 00:23:54,424
At the next corner, a bye-bye
while looking over our shoulders

363
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,934
yup!

364
00:23:57,934 --> 00:23:59,764
What is it about swimming
that makes you so tired?

365
00:23:59,764 --> 00:24:02,674
Especially at noon after swim class, right?

366
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:04,074
That's how the fear begins, isn't it?

367
00:24:04,074 --> 00:24:04,474
Saved
That's how the fear begins, isn't it?

368
00:24:04,474 --> 00:24:04,944
That's how the fear begins, isn't it?

369
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:05,604
Meaning?

370
00:24:05,604 --> 00:24:08,714
If you sleep at noon, you won't
be able to sleep at night,

371
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:11,984
but if you don't sleep at night,
you'll get sleepy at noon...

372
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:13,744
Oh, that totally happens!

373
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,254

When that happens, you can break the cycle
by sleeping from noon to the next morning.

376
00:24:18,254 --> 00:24:20,954
When that happens, you can break the cycle

377
00:24:20,954 --> 00:24:22,714
How many hours do you sleep?!
