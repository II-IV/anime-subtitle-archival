00:00:06,164 --> 00:00:07,404
Good morning!

2
00:00:07,404 --> 00:00:09,494
Oh, good morning. It's been a while.

3
00:00:09,734 --> 00:00:10,894
You got darker, huh?

4
00:00:11,004 --> 00:00:12,494
I went to the beach.

5
00:00:13,274 --> 00:00:15,004
Yuko-chan!

6
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:18,284
Yuko-chan, good morning.

7
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,954
Ah. Run, Toru. 'Morning.

8
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,354
Good morning.

9
00:00:22,714 --> 00:00:24,914
School's started, huh?

10
00:00:25,154 --> 00:00:29,594
That's right. I'm sad that summer vacation's over.

11
00:00:29,594 --> 00:00:31,994
But it was fun, huh?

12
00:00:31,994 --> 00:00:33,654
Yeah, I guess.

13
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:36,254
Ah. Nagi.

14
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:38,664
Nagi-chan, good morning!

15
00:00:39,004 --> 00:00:39,594
Shh!

16
00:00:40,104 --> 00:00:42,974
What're you doin'? You'll be late.

17
00:00:45,544 --> 00:00:47,004
Good morning!

18
00:00:50,614 --> 00:00:51,974
Good morning!

19
00:00:52,384 --> 00:00:55,814
Ma'am! G-Good morning, Miss Kito!

20
00:00:56,314 --> 00:01:01,984
What's the matter? It's the start of the
new semester, but you're lacking SPIRIT!

21
00:01:02,094 --> 00:01:04,154
Now then, once again!

22
00:01:04,394 --> 00:01:05,364
Now!

23
00:01:06,064 --> 00:01:07,494
Good morning!

24
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,794
G-Good morning!

25
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:12,524
Not good enough. Once again!

26
00:01:12,764 --> 00:01:14,734
Good morning! Go!

27
00:01:17,704 --> 00:01:19,534
GOOD MORNING!

28
00:01:19,674 --> 00:01:21,704
I'm sorry, Yuko.

THE NEW SEMESTER

43
00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:09,614
First morning of the new semester
and you're already stifling!

44
00:03:09,614 --> 00:03:11,554
The students will hate you.

45
00:03:11,554 --> 00:03:17,754
I-It's not as if I want to make friends with them!
Also, the students need discipline!

46
00:03:18,424 --> 00:03:21,734
But in all things, allowances are necessary,
are they not?

47
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:25,134
You have to be hands-off, to an extent. Right?

48
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:27,124
Sato. 'Morning.

49
00:03:27,404 --> 00:03:30,864
The way YOU are hands-off,
Kamate-chan, is the best.

50
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,874
In a pinch, you'd just leave me on my own.

51
00:03:33,874 --> 00:03:36,344
Aah, I feel all tingly.

52
00:03:36,614 --> 00:03:40,874
Yes! The way you ignore me,
disavowing my existence!

53
00:03:42,384 --> 00:03:46,044
Please don't blurt out such
nasty-sounding things! It's unpleasant!

54
00:03:46,354 --> 00:03:48,654
Kito, you should just ignore him, too.

55
00:03:48,654 --> 00:03:50,054
That's offensive!

56
00:03:50,294 --> 00:03:55,334
Miss Kito, your bellowing rings in my head
and makes it hurt, so won't you stop?

57
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:58,904
If that's the case, why not go back
to the nurse's office?

58
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:03,874
Why don't YOU go to the classroom?
Back to your beloved students. Go on, hurry.

59
00:04:03,874 --> 00:04:05,874
Just what's with that tone?!

60
00:04:05,874 --> 00:04:06,644
I'm SO sorry.

61
00:04:06,644 --> 00:04:07,414
These quarreling such-and-suches...
Look, why don't you just start dating?
I'm SO sorry.

62
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,174
These quarreling such-and-suches...
Look, why don't you just start dating?
There you go again!

63
00:04:09,174 --> 00:04:11,344
These quarreling such-and-suches...
Look, why don't you just start dating?
My apologies.

64
00:04:11,344 --> 00:04:12,904
These quarreling such-and-suches...
Look, why don't you just start dating?
Just cut it out!

65
00:04:13,284 --> 00:04:15,684
If that's a joke, it's not funny.

66
00:04:15,884 --> 00:04:17,714
Even your timing is the same...

67
00:04:18,484 --> 00:04:21,254
That's too intense for first thing in the morning.

68
00:04:21,254 --> 00:04:22,314
Oh?

69
00:04:22,594 --> 00:04:23,764
Good morning, Run-chan.

70
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,794
Good morning. It's been a while.

71
00:04:25,794 --> 00:04:27,164
Good morning!

72
00:04:28,194 --> 00:04:30,404
Oh, you've got darker! Where did you go?

73
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:31,334
The boys are swarming again!
Oh, you've got darker! Where did you go?

74
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:32,804
The boys are swarming again!
I went to Thailand.

75
00:04:32,804 --> 00:04:35,294
Really? How nice!

76
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:39,404
There she is, the freshman
who really likes Run-chan.

77
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,574
Giving it your all from the new semester, huh?

78
00:04:42,344 --> 00:04:43,714
Though you're tiny.

79
00:04:48,014 --> 00:04:48,984
Toru?

80
00:04:54,854 --> 00:04:56,294
She's so tall!

81
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:01,054
W-we're sorry.

82
00:05:08,004 --> 00:05:11,264
You're all cruel! Leavin' me like that...

83
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:13,844
Sorry, Yuko.

84
00:05:13,844 --> 00:05:16,034
It really was terrible. Huh?

85
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:19,084
Why you holdin' a chair?

86
00:05:19,314 --> 00:05:20,304
Dunno.

87
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:25,744
Good morning!

88
00:05:26,754 --> 00:05:28,744
Yes, yes. That's it.

89
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,994
It was in the tabloids this morning.

90
00:05:30,994 --> 00:05:31,824
Torun and Miporin are chatting!

91
00:05:31,824 --> 00:05:33,724
Oh, I read that.
Torun and Miporin are chatting!

92
00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:36,784
I, Yutaka, want in, too!

93
00:05:36,934 --> 00:05:38,734
Japan's political and economic climate is-

94
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:41,264
But regulatory reform
should come first, shouldn't it?

95
00:05:42,534 --> 00:05:45,004
What's the matter? Yutaka?

96
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,504
Japan's political and economic climate...
Regulatory reform...

97
00:05:49,414 --> 00:05:53,614
It's too difficult. For me, Yutaka,
the hurdle is too high!

98
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:57,514
Say, did you watch the show last night?

99
00:05:58,454 --> 00:06:01,424
I did! That hot-blooded high school drama.

100
00:06:02,754 --> 00:06:05,964
That teacher is a little stifling, isn't she?

101
00:06:05,964 --> 00:06:07,794
But that makes it good.

102
00:06:07,794 --> 00:06:10,024
Torun! Miporin!

103
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,664
Good morning!

104
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,864
Hey! That's too hot, Yutaka!

105
00:06:19,544 --> 00:06:21,734
Okay, take your seats.

106
00:06:26,244 --> 00:06:27,874
Good morning!

107
00:06:29,384 --> 00:06:34,444
Okay, today begins the second semester.
Let's give it our all!

108
00:06:34,754 --> 00:06:35,424
Good morning!

109
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:36,514
Stifling...
Good morning!

110
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,184
Begin warm-up exercises.

111
00:06:47,704 --> 00:06:50,764
And no slacking. You'll hurt yourselves later.

112
00:06:51,404 --> 00:06:55,104
Sure enough, she just doesn't care!

113
00:06:58,844 --> 00:07:00,244
Say, Toru-san?

114
00:07:00,584 --> 00:07:01,584
What?

115
00:07:01,584 --> 00:07:03,604
About our earlier conversation...

116
00:07:03,854 --> 00:07:05,284
Torun!

117
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:08,324
This time it's MY turn!

118
00:07:08,324 --> 00:07:09,484
S-Stop.

119
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,364
Now look, you!

120
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:15,024
How I missed you!
Summer vacation was so long!

121
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,994
You saw her at orientation, didn't you?!

122
00:07:16,994 --> 00:07:18,934
I don't 'member that.

123
00:07:19,304 --> 00:07:20,564
Oh, really?

124
00:07:22,804 --> 00:07:24,234
This is...

125
00:07:25,474 --> 00:07:30,384
Okay, it's been three minutes.
Step away from Toru-san now.

126
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:33,744
Huh? Already?

127
00:07:34,314 --> 00:07:35,284
Yutaka!

128
00:07:35,284 --> 00:07:36,354
Okay.

129
00:07:36,354 --> 00:07:37,754
The three-minute rule.

130
00:07:38,154 --> 00:07:40,924
That's the agreement for your fans, Toru-san.

131
00:07:40,924 --> 00:07:45,414
Um, you've said the word "fan" before.
Have I done something?

132
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:53,534
Toru-san, you can do ANYTHING,
but you don't brag about it...

133
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:55,234
That's right, that's right!

134
00:07:55,234 --> 00:07:58,374
And she's always so calm and cool.

135
00:07:58,374 --> 00:07:59,734
Right?

136
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:05,234
Still, I'm sure you've heard this a million times...

137
00:08:06,044 --> 00:08:09,214
Huh? Toru-san? Where's Toru-san?

138
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,974
What's the matter?

139
00:08:13,484 --> 00:08:14,724
Nothing at all.

140
00:08:14,724 --> 00:08:16,124
Torun!

141
00:08:16,324 --> 00:08:18,954
Toru-san? Do you have a moment?

142
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:20,954
I have a favor to ask.

143
00:08:21,964 --> 00:08:23,654
Yes, Miss Kito.

144
00:08:23,764 --> 00:08:25,164
Torun...

145
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,264
Sorry to interrupt you.

146
00:08:27,434 --> 00:08:29,264
I'll be borrowing Toru-san.

147
00:08:30,034 --> 00:08:32,674
I'd like you to get the notebooks for class.

148
00:08:32,674 --> 00:08:33,264
Ma'am.

149
00:08:33,644 --> 00:08:35,244
That's cruel.

150
00:08:35,244 --> 00:08:36,574
What is?

151
00:08:36,574 --> 00:08:40,584
Even if you're a teacher,
you have to obey the three-minute rule!

152
00:08:40,584 --> 00:08:41,244
Hey!

153
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,924
Okay, so if you'd get started on that...

154
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:44,354
Ma'am.

155
00:08:44,354 --> 00:08:45,584
That's it!

156
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,754
Just three minutes!

157
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,354
Any more is-

158
00:08:50,124 --> 00:08:51,664
See you soon, Toru-san.

159
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:54,394
S-stop!

160
00:08:55,664 --> 00:08:56,634
Here.

161
00:08:56,864 --> 00:08:58,604
If you don't mind.

162
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,034
Yes, ma'am.

163
00:09:00,204 --> 00:09:02,004
Oh, I forgot.

164
00:09:02,404 --> 00:09:04,464
Can I ask you to do these, too?

165
00:09:06,974 --> 00:09:10,104
While you're at it, get some coffee
from the vending machine.

166
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:15,084
Miss Kamate! Please don't use
the students to run your errands!

167
00:09:15,954 --> 00:09:18,354
That's not what I wanna hear, is it?

168
00:09:19,984 --> 00:09:22,184
Fine, YOU can do it for me.

169
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:24,584
You can go yourself, can't you?!

170
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,924
Hey, you. 'Scuse me.

171
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,534
Um... Um...

172
00:09:36,674 --> 00:09:39,474
K's POEMS
Whose notebook might THIS be?

173
00:09:39,474 --> 00:09:40,134
K's POEMS

174
00:09:43,514 --> 00:09:45,984
You like your coffee black, right?

175
00:09:45,984 --> 00:09:47,884
Thanks a lot.

176
00:09:51,954 --> 00:09:55,584
Torun's taking so long. I'm lonely...

177
00:09:56,154 --> 00:09:58,494
She'll be back soon.

178
00:09:59,494 --> 00:10:00,684
Huh?

179
00:10:00,894 --> 00:10:02,294
What is it?

180
00:10:02,364 --> 00:10:05,334
It's the upperclassmen
who are always with Toru-san.

181
00:10:05,464 --> 00:10:07,024
Sure enough!

182
00:10:07,404 --> 00:10:10,994
That light-skinned upperclassman is pretty, huh?

183
00:10:11,304 --> 00:10:12,134
Yeah.

184
00:10:12,644 --> 00:10:16,514
That glasses-wearing upperclassman
looks so smart!

185
00:10:16,744 --> 00:10:17,734
Yeah.

186
00:10:17,944 --> 00:10:21,214
That girl who looks like a model is...

187
00:10:23,284 --> 00:10:25,044
That's Upperclassman Broom, isn't it?

188
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:27,384
Is there a fire?!

189
00:10:28,224 --> 00:10:31,364
Wrong. It's Upperclassman MOP.

190
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,624
Oh!

191
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,394
What's up? Caught a cold?

192
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,564
I know a way to stop them!

193
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:44,264
You have to slap the back as hard as you can!

194
00:10:44,804 --> 00:10:46,534
That's for hiccups.

195
00:10:46,674 --> 00:10:47,764
Wrong.

196
00:10:49,444 --> 00:10:50,344
Who's that?!

197
00:10:50,344 --> 00:10:52,214
It takes a blow to the solar plexus.

198
00:10:52,544 --> 00:10:54,014
Toru!

199
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:56,044
Don't scare us like that!

200
00:10:56,684 --> 00:10:58,274
It's Toru-san!

201
00:10:58,384 --> 00:11:00,914
What do you think they're talking about?

202
00:11:03,094 --> 00:11:05,264
They really are good friends.

203
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,784
Yeah...

204
00:11:10,064 --> 00:11:11,724
We'll help you.

205
00:11:12,164 --> 00:11:13,104
Thank you.

206
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:14,634
There.

207
00:11:15,204 --> 00:11:16,504
I'll take this.

208
00:11:19,074 --> 00:11:21,444
You don't have to take ALL of it.

209
00:11:21,774 --> 00:11:22,744
You carried them this far by yourself,
so this makes it half, right?

210
00:11:22,744 --> 00:11:24,884
I can leave my shoes here, right?
You carried them this far by yourself,
so this makes it half, right?

211
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,434
I'm sure it's fine.
You carried them this far by yourself,
so this makes it half, right?

212
00:11:30,184 --> 00:11:32,014
She's blushing!

213
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:34,294
How charming.

214
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:35,624
Yeah...

215
00:11:36,324 --> 00:11:37,464
Huh?

216
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:40,794
That upperclassman
started talking to some boys.

217
00:11:40,964 --> 00:11:44,194
Huh? Torun went somewhere...

218
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:48,774
Oh, she's back.

219
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,604
With a bat. Will she be playing baseball?

220
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,074
K's POEMS

221
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:59,044
That should do it.

222
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,884
I'll be back.

223
00:12:19,034 --> 00:12:20,664
GOOD MORNING!

224
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,404
G-good morning, Miss Kito.

225
00:12:26,174 --> 00:12:28,334
She got me again.

226
00:12:28,574 --> 00:12:30,684
That was unlucky, huh?

227
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:32,404
Got that right...

228
00:12:33,144 --> 00:12:35,644
Say, Toru hasn't shown up today, huh?

229
00:12:36,114 --> 00:12:38,084
She have class duties again?

230
00:12:40,484 --> 00:12:42,544
We're fighting right now.

231
00:12:43,894 --> 00:12:44,984
For real?

232
00:12:45,624 --> 00:12:46,964
Everything okay?!

233
00:12:46,964 --> 00:12:50,054
Yeah. It happens once in a while.

234
00:12:50,264 --> 00:12:53,604
They're FIGHTING! What do we do, Nagi?!

235
00:12:53,604 --> 00:12:55,574
What good will freaking out do?

236
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:56,464
Just calm down.

237
00:12:56,574 --> 00:13:01,104
But! Fighting is just... I can't believe it!

238
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,444
I told you, calm down.

239
00:13:05,414 --> 00:13:07,584
I-In any case, let's ask what happened.

240
00:13:07,584 --> 00:13:08,584
Okay.

241
00:13:08,584 --> 00:13:10,674
Well? Why are you fighting?

242
00:13:18,094 --> 00:13:19,954
Um, well...

243
00:13:22,894 --> 00:13:25,794
It's gotten late. I'll walk you back.

244
00:13:26,234 --> 00:13:27,164
I'm fine.

245
00:13:27,164 --> 00:13:29,894
But there've been perverts out lately!

246
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:35,874
If so, then after you've walked me, you'd be
in trouble coming back by yourself, right?

247
00:13:35,874 --> 00:13:36,674
I'll be fine.

248
00:13:36,674 --> 00:13:40,714
You'll be in trouble! But I'LL be fine!

249
00:13:40,714 --> 00:13:43,014
Why are you being so stubborn?

250
00:13:43,014 --> 00:13:45,984
YOU are! What'll you do if something happens?!

251
00:13:45,984 --> 00:13:47,894
This is a residential area! I'll be fine.

252
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,794
Then the same goes for me, right?!

253
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:51,694
And it goes for me, too!

254
00:13:51,694 --> 00:13:53,594
It goes more for me!

255
00:13:54,894 --> 00:13:57,694
That's how our argument went.

256
00:13:58,164 --> 00:14:00,654
So, what finally happened?

257
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,374
She stayed at my house.

258
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:04,974
While you were fighting?!

259
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:06,134
Yeah.

260
00:14:13,884 --> 00:14:16,814
Can you even call that "fighting"?

261
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:29,254
Run and Toru, fighting...
I wonder if Toru's feelin' depressed.

262
00:14:46,414 --> 00:14:47,604
Toru...

263
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,344
Run-chan, you idiot.

264
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:56,384
Wow. She's drinkin' like she's mad!

265
00:14:57,494 --> 00:14:59,854
Doesn't feel like I can come out now...

266
00:15:01,364 --> 00:15:03,194
Wait, did she notice me?

267
00:15:09,704 --> 00:15:11,364
She got them all in!

268
00:15:12,104 --> 00:15:13,974
Okay, I'll bring them next time.

269
00:15:13,974 --> 00:15:15,174
Thank you.

270
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:18,974
Fighting, huh?

271
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:23,504
Toru seems like she'd be down,
but Run looks the same as always.

272
00:15:27,354 --> 00:15:29,984
Unusual to see you reading a novel, Run.

273
00:15:30,224 --> 00:15:31,424
Really?

274
00:15:31,424 --> 00:15:32,484
What're you reading?

275
00:15:35,264 --> 00:15:38,424
Run. This is upside-down.

276
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:52,844
Generally, when y = ax2 + bx +c is 1
and ax2 + bx + c = 0 is 2...

277
00:15:53,214 --> 00:15:57,414
"When casualties result from
accidents or calamities,

278
00:15:57,514 --> 00:16:00,684
"the people in those environments must,
by their own hands..."

279
00:16:00,684 --> 00:16:04,854
Man, this is long. Everyone,
look over the rest of this yourselves.

280
00:16:10,464 --> 00:16:11,994
What should we do?

281
00:16:13,634 --> 00:16:15,734
Nagi, aren't you worried?

282
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:20,674
Yes, I am! But I don't know what to do.

283
00:16:23,644 --> 00:16:26,114
Just watching them is so tough...

284
00:16:26,114 --> 00:16:27,484
Yeah, I guess.

285
00:16:27,484 --> 00:16:32,154
Aah, what should we do? How troubling...

286
00:16:32,154 --> 00:16:34,174
If you have troubles, I will hear them!

287
00:16:35,154 --> 00:16:36,354
Miss Kito!

288
00:16:36,354 --> 00:16:39,224
I will listen to ANY trouble!

289
00:16:39,224 --> 00:16:42,564
N-no! It's not like I have a trouble or anything-

290
00:16:42,564 --> 00:16:43,864
Wait right there!

291
00:16:43,864 --> 00:16:48,374
Keeping troubles inside your heart is the worst
thing to do! Come, open your heart!

292
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,704
I-I'm telling you, I don't have any troubles.

293
00:16:51,704 --> 00:16:52,944
Don't hide it!

294
00:16:52,944 --> 00:16:58,214
Be honest with your teacher!
Come! Come, come, come! Come!

295
00:16:58,214 --> 00:16:59,814
What are you so shy about?!

296
00:16:59,814 --> 00:17:01,284
I'm fine!

297
00:17:01,284 --> 00:17:03,714
I won't do wrong by you! Come!

298
00:17:03,954 --> 00:17:05,854
Look, I don't have any troubles!

299
00:17:05,854 --> 00:17:07,184
Wait, Yuko-san! Don't hold back.
Open your heart to your teacher!

300
00:17:07,184 --> 00:17:09,654
She really is unlucky, huh?
Wait, Yuko-san! Don't hold back.
Open your heart to your teacher!

301
00:17:30,744 --> 00:17:31,944
Run-chan...

302
00:17:32,444 --> 00:17:38,384
Torun looks pretty down. It's up to me,
Yutaka, to cheer her up!

303
00:17:40,284 --> 00:17:41,984
What is it, Miporin?

304
00:17:42,724 --> 00:17:45,064
Let's go back, Yutaka.

305
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,434
Toru-san doesn't look like
she's up for that right now.

306
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,894
But...

307
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:51,464
Come on, let's go.

308
00:17:51,464 --> 00:17:54,694
Miporin! That hurts!

309
00:18:08,914 --> 00:18:10,574
I finally lost her.

310
00:18:13,824 --> 00:18:15,054
Toru?

311
00:18:34,274 --> 00:18:36,974
Sure enough, we should make up!

312
00:18:36,974 --> 00:18:38,464
I'm going to the co-op!

313
00:18:38,544 --> 00:18:41,914
W-wait! Why are you going to the co-op?!

314
00:18:46,424 --> 00:18:49,794
I need snacks so we can make up.

315
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:51,284
You're going to BUY her?

316
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:54,764
These, please.

317
00:18:54,764 --> 00:18:56,854
Okay, that's 200 yen.

318
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:08,144
Five Yen

319
00:19:08,144 --> 00:19:10,514
Five Yen
Should I pay?

320
00:19:23,524 --> 00:19:31,024
Kumo ga dokoka ni fuwari tonde yuku
The clouds drift off somewhere

321
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:32,604
She beat me to it!
Sore o koko de tada miageteta
We just looked up and watch them from here

322
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:32,804
Sore o koko de tada miageteta
We just looked up and watch them from here

323
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,774
Where are you going now? Hey!
Sore o koko de tada miageteta
We just looked up and watch them from here

324
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:36,774
Jeez...
Sore o koko de tada miageteta
We just looked up and watch them from here

325
00:19:36,774 --> 00:19:39,134
Sore o koko de tada miageteta
We just looked up and watch them from here

326
00:19:39,474 --> 00:19:41,144
Sora o tobereba kimi to doko made mo
If I could fly in the sky, then I could go anywhere

327
00:19:41,144 --> 00:19:43,274
Is something up with this?
Sora o tobereba kimi to doko made mo
If I could fly in the sky, then I could go anywhere

328
00:19:43,274 --> 00:19:43,844
Sora o tobereba kimi to doko made mo
If I could fly in the sky, then I could go anywhere

329
00:19:43,844 --> 00:19:45,844
I'm
sorry.
Sora o tobereba kimi to doko made mo
If I could fly in the sky, then I could go anywhere

330
00:19:45,844 --> 00:19:47,014
Sora o tobereba kimi to doko made mo
If I could fly in the sky, then I could go anywhere

331
00:19:47,014 --> 00:19:54,554
Ikeru ne, Nani ga matteru no ka na
With you, couldn't I? I wonder what awaits

332
00:19:54,554 --> 00:20:01,794
Itsu datte taisetsu na mono wa
You always notice what's important

333
00:20:01,794 --> 00:20:03,034
Toru!
Itsu datte taisetsu na mono wa
You always notice what's important

334
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:03,264
Itsu datte taisetsu na mono wa
You always notice what's important

335
00:20:03,264 --> 00:20:11,544
Naku shite kara kizutsuku kara
Once you've gotten rid of it

336
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:19,104
Sunao ni narereba tsutawaru deshou
If we could be honest then I'm sure you'd get it

337
00:20:19,444 --> 00:20:25,324
Ameagari ni kakaru niji no shita futari
Those two under the rainbow after the rain cleared

338
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:30,794
Waraeteru ka na - Ima wa kimi to kono michi o
I wonder if they can laugh - Now, on this path with you

339
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:37,664
Zutto zutto aruite yukou
I'll walk on, forever and ever

340
00:20:47,674 --> 00:20:50,044
Torun wasn't cheery.

341
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,344
I'm worried.

342
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:53,984
Yeah...

343
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:01,384
But maybe everything's okay now.

344
00:21:09,594 --> 00:21:11,404
So it's settled, huh?

345
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:14,194
Yeah. That was a shock to my system.

346
00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:17,434
You got a handkerchief?

347
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:20,604
Well well, Nagi. Moved, were ya?

348
00:21:20,604 --> 00:21:21,634
Huh?

349
00:21:23,714 --> 00:21:26,184
How could one NOT be moved?!

350
00:21:26,544 --> 00:21:29,214
M-Miss Kito! When did you?

351
00:21:34,724 --> 00:21:37,054
Well, let's go home, Yutaka.

352
00:21:37,054 --> 00:21:38,254
Okay!

353
00:21:39,094 --> 00:21:41,634
You think Torun will be cheerful tomorrow?

354
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:42,764
Probably.

355
00:21:42,764 --> 00:21:45,354
So we can have fun together, huh?

356
00:21:45,934 --> 00:21:47,104
For just three minutes.

357
00:21:47,104 --> 00:21:48,794
Huh?!

358
00:21:49,504 --> 00:21:50,494
K's POEMS

359
00:22:09,054 --> 00:22:10,854
Okay, I'm goin' home.

360
00:22:10,854 --> 00:22:11,794
Yeah.

361
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:16,334
See you.

362
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:18,234
Okay. Have a good night.

363
00:22:20,004 --> 00:22:24,734
Drink it

364
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:46,624
Akane ni narabu seitaka kageboushi

365
00:22:46,624 --> 00:22:53,594
Tanoshii ichinichi no owari

366
00:22:55,434 --> 00:23:02,614
Tsukinai oshaberi mada mada aru keredo

367
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:09,954
Sorosoro o-uchi ni kaeranakucha

368
00:23:09,954 --> 00:23:13,254
Jaa ne, ashita ne

369
00:23:13,484 --> 00:23:16,784
Mail suru kara

370
00:23:17,154 --> 00:23:24,434
Kyou no page ni minna osoroi no egao

371
00:23:24,434 --> 00:23:27,734
Jaa ne, ashita ne

372

374
00:23:40,284 --> 00:23:47,454
Ru-ru-run, kaze to kokoro humming suru

375
00:23:47,454 --> 00:23:54,024
Tsugi no kado de furimukinagara bye-bye

376
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,534
yup!

377
00:23:57,534 --> 00:23:59,034
Once summer's done,
it's straight to autumn, huh?

378
00:23:59,034 --> 00:24:01,634
That's fast! It's TOO fast,
don't you think, Miporin?

379
00:24:01,634 --> 00:24:02,504
I'm not sure.

380
00:24:02,504 --> 00:24:06,074
All of a sudden, it's Halloween?!
That's just unforgivable!

381
00:24:06,074 --> 00:24:07,674
Still, what can we?

382
00:24:07,674 --> 00:24:10,314
We haven't done any important stories yet!

383
00:24:10,314 --> 00:24:15,014
Like gazing at the moon alone with Torun,
or Torun and I at the PE festival together!

384
00:24:15,014 --> 00:24:16,444
The two of you ain't gonna happen.

388
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,554
Miporin, you're scary.
