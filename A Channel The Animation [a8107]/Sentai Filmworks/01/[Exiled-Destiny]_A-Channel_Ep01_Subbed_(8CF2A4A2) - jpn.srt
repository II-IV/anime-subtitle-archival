1
00:00:45,244 --> 00:00:46,104
Run!

2
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:49,934
Good morning.

3
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:51,244
Good morning.

4
00:00:51,414 --> 00:00:54,454
Ah, Nagi-chan! Yuko-chan! Good morning.

5
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:57,684
What's with you? Standing there motionless...

6
00:00:57,684 --> 00:01:01,224
Hey, look! This was stuck on my forehead!

7
00:01:01,224 --> 00:01:03,124
You just now noticed?

8
00:01:03,394 --> 00:01:04,124
Yeah!

9
00:01:04,324 --> 00:01:06,464
You're the same as always, Run.

10
00:01:06,464 --> 00:01:08,164
Oh. Really?

11
00:01:08,164 --> 00:01:09,134
Run-chan.

12
00:01:09,294 --> 00:01:10,064
Good morning.

13
00:01:10,064 --> 00:01:10,834
Good morning!

14
00:01:10,834 --> 00:01:12,234
Run-chan!

15
00:01:12,234 --> 00:01:13,134
Good morning!

16
00:01:13,134 --> 00:01:15,034
Hey, did you watch the show yesterday?

17
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:15,204
Yeah, I did! It was fun!

18
00:01:15,204 --> 00:01:17,744
Run sure has a lot of male friends, huh?
Yeah, I did! It was fun!

19
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,434
Yeah...

20
00:01:38,124 --> 00:01:39,724
T-Toru!

21
00:01:40,094 --> 00:01:42,064
It's early but she's full of spunk, huh?

22
00:01:42,564 --> 00:01:44,624
What's the matter, Toru?

23
00:01:48,334 --> 00:01:49,824
Run-chan...

24
00:02:01,854 --> 00:02:04,754
Cloudy and ephemeral

25
00:02:04,754 --> 00:02:13,494
Becoming one with the glittering, faraway sky

26
00:02:13,494 --> 00:02:21,594
My wind-reading, willful destination is far away

27
00:02:22,134 --> 00:02:25,274
Let's go together

28
00:02:25,274 --> 00:02:30,974
I'll inhale deeply and go, the world's spring breath

29
00:02:31,244 --> 00:02:36,374
The smiling faces of everyone gathered in the sun

30
00:02:37,084 --> 00:02:43,824
In between "Good morning" and
"Goodbye," there is only us

31
00:02:43,824 --> 00:02:47,384
We can do anything, can't we?

32
00:02:47,764 --> 00:02:53,494
Transparent beams of sunlight, a newborn sky

33
00:02:53,704 --> 00:02:59,604
A morning arch at which we promised to meet

34
00:02:59,604 --> 00:03:07,104
To you, waving your hand, I'll give a special today

35
00:03:07,284 --> 00:03:10,514
And the talking will begin

36
00:03:19,864 --> 00:03:21,164
Toru Nagi
A-CHANNEL
Yuko
Run

37
00:03:21,164 --> 00:03:24,824
LOVE

38
00:03:27,704 --> 00:03:29,394
Good morning, Toru.

39
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:31,564
You're still short, huh?

40
00:03:32,704 --> 00:03:34,074
Don't pet me!

41
00:03:35,844 --> 00:03:36,514
Hey!

42
00:03:36,514 --> 00:03:39,104
Why's your uniform so dirty?! Did you fall?

43
00:03:40,514 --> 00:03:41,484
Well, Run-chan...

44
00:03:41,484 --> 00:03:43,044
The thing is...

45
00:03:43,554 --> 00:03:46,074
What?! Don't tell me Run was being bullied!

46
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:53,854
She was chasing a butterfly and
looked like she'd get hit by a car.

47
00:03:55,664 --> 00:03:57,134
You sure look after her.

48
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:03,594
Well, see ya, Toru.

49
00:04:04,604 --> 00:04:05,364
See you.

50
00:04:06,404 --> 00:04:09,104
Well, see you at lunch, Toru.

51
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:12,514
Good morning!

52
00:04:30,034 --> 00:04:33,404
Successful Applicants - Aoigaoka High School

53
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:42,734
Yes?

54
00:04:42,844 --> 00:04:44,774
Hello, Run-chan?

55
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:47,284
Toru! It's been ages!

56
00:04:47,514 --> 00:04:51,284
Yeah. Say, can I come by right now?

57
00:04:51,484 --> 00:04:53,814
Sure, come over.

58
00:04:54,324 --> 00:04:57,524
Thanks. Well, see you in a bit.

59
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:04,094
"Been ages," huh?

60
00:05:04,734 --> 00:05:08,894
I guess it has been a while,
what with tests and all.

61
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:22,574
Coming!

62
00:05:24,554 --> 00:05:27,754
Oh, Toru-chan! It's been a while.

63
00:05:27,754 --> 00:05:29,154
I hope you've been well.

64
00:05:29,424 --> 00:05:31,514
Run's inside.

65
00:05:31,824 --> 00:05:33,094
Thank you.

66
00:05:35,464 --> 00:05:37,054
Pardon the intrusion.

67
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:03,914
Run-chan... I wonder if she'll be happy.

68
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:16,034
Run-chan!

69
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:19,774
I got into your high school, Run-chan! I passed!

70
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,034
Ah, Toru!

71
00:06:34,654 --> 00:06:35,524
Wha...

72
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:36,884
Wha...

73
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:38,214
Wha...

74
00:06:38,494 --> 00:06:39,554
Wha...

75
00:06:49,634 --> 00:06:51,304
Ow!

76
00:06:51,304 --> 00:06:52,804
Run, what's with this chick?!

77
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:55,774
Run-chan, who is this? What was that just now?

78
00:06:55,774 --> 00:06:58,444
You passed? Congratulations!

79
00:06:58,444 --> 00:07:00,214
Never mind that I passed!

80
00:07:00,314 --> 00:07:01,904
Is this Toru?

81
00:07:02,614 --> 00:07:04,724
She really is short, isn't she?

82
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,814
So this is who you wanted to introduce us to?

83
00:07:07,454 --> 00:07:08,624
"Introduce"?

84
00:07:08,624 --> 00:07:10,424
Yeah, that's right!

85
00:07:10,424 --> 00:07:14,194
Today's when they announce who passed,
so I thought you might come by.

86
00:07:14,194 --> 00:07:15,754
That's why I asked them here.

87
00:07:15,964 --> 00:07:20,804
These are my friends from school,
Yuko-chan and Nagi-chan.

88
00:07:20,804 --> 00:07:21,494
Hey there.

89
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:23,994
Friends...

90
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,804
We'll be seeing you this spring, Toru.

91
00:07:28,074 --> 00:07:30,984
Whoa, she's totally hatin' on me!

92
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:35,814
Your first impression was terrible, Yuko.
Tell her what was going on just now.

93
00:07:41,324 --> 00:07:46,094
Um... You misunderstood.
Run was tryin' to tickle me.

94
00:07:46,294 --> 00:07:46,494
I wasn't doin' nothin' weird.

95
00:07:46,494 --> 00:07:48,194
Note: Yuko has let loose with her rough-and-ready Kansai dialect.

96
00:07:48,194 --> 00:07:48,734

We were just playin' around.

97
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:50,224
We were just playin' around.

98
00:07:59,304 --> 00:08:01,644
The heck was that for?!

99
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:11,824
Eeeek!
I'm glad they've opened up
to each other already.

100
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,084
Eeeek!
SQUEEEZE
I'm glad they've opened up
to each other already.

101
00:08:13,084 --> 00:08:13,524
Eeeek!
I'm glad they've opened up

102
00:08:13,524 --> 00:08:14,124
Eeeek!

Eeeek!

104
00:08:14,154 --> 00:08:14,554
Eeeek!
Slap
So we shouldn't stop them?

105
00:08:14,554 --> 00:08:14,794
Eeeek!
Slap
Stop it!
So we shouldn't stop them?

106
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:15,254
Eeeek!
Stop it!
So we shouldn't stop them?

107
00:08:15,254 --> 00:08:16,154
Eeeek!
Stop it! Bwomp
So we shouldn't stop them?

108
00:08:16,154 --> 00:08:16,594
Eeeek!
Stop it! Bwomp

109
00:08:16,594 --> 00:08:16,724
Eeeek!
Stop it!

110
00:08:16,724 --> 00:08:17,554
Eeeek!

111
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:40,174
So, I'm passin' out handouts
for your elective classes, okay?

112
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:43,174
You all did this last year,
so you know the drill, right?

113
00:08:43,654 --> 00:08:44,644
Here.

114
00:08:58,904 --> 00:09:02,564
Our homeroom teacher
this year is pretty flippant...

115
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:08,314
And so, that is how to fill out your
elective course printouts.

I wonder if Run's okay...

125
00:10:12,974 --> 00:10:14,604
What is she doing?

126
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,744
Lunch time, lunch time!

127
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:26,184
Toru, let's eat.

128
00:10:26,454 --> 00:10:28,154
You sure are eager.

129
00:10:28,154 --> 00:10:30,124
Toru isn't here yet.

130
00:10:30,124 --> 00:10:32,754
Oh, you're right. I just...

131
00:10:34,394 --> 00:10:36,364
She's here, Nagi-chan! That's Toru, all right!

132
00:10:36,364 --> 00:10:38,104
Run
chan!
She's here, Nagi-chan! That's Toru, all right!

134

Run
chan!
Don't tell me...

135
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:39,234
Don't tell me...

136
00:10:39,234 --> 00:10:40,864
She heard just now?

137
00:10:51,744 --> 00:10:54,614
Ah! That squirrel pick is so cute!

138
00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:57,554
Yeah, right? I love that stuff.

139
00:10:57,554 --> 00:10:59,784
I like animals!

140
00:10:59,954 --> 00:11:03,514
Huh. What kinda animal you like, Run?

141
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,224
Birds, I guess.

142
00:11:06,224 --> 00:11:08,134
Like, parakeets?

143
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,264
They're cute, aren't they?

144
00:11:10,264 --> 00:11:11,634
Come to think of it...

145
00:11:16,374 --> 00:11:19,004
Run, your head looks like a parakeet's.

146
00:11:19,744 --> 00:11:21,574
And they're delicious!

147
00:11:22,174 --> 00:11:23,444
THAT'S how you like them?!

148
00:11:23,444 --> 00:11:25,604
Eatin' parakeets is just cruel!

149
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:27,844
That ain't true, right?!

150
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,984
Run-chan likes chicken.

151
00:11:34,254 --> 00:11:35,554
Oh, so that's it?

152
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:37,994
Meaning, chicken is
one of your fave foods, right?

153
00:11:37,994 --> 00:11:41,234
That's right! But I like all kinds of meat.

154
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,394
Wanna get Korean barbecue sometime?

155
00:11:46,364 --> 00:11:49,004
I wanna eat short ribs and salted tongue!

156
00:11:49,004 --> 00:11:51,994
Now I really want to eat Korean barbecue!

157
00:11:52,404 --> 00:11:56,344
It's like I can even HEAR the sound of
grilling meat coming from somewhere!

159
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,544
Sorry, that's me.

160
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:06,484
It's your ringtone?!

161
00:12:07,424 --> 00:12:09,684
Run, your rolled egg looks delicious!

162
00:12:10,324 --> 00:12:11,564
Gimme a bite?

163
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,394
Sure! Here.

164
00:12:13,394 --> 00:12:14,454
Thanks.

165
00:12:18,564 --> 00:12:22,804
Ah, that's delicious! Did you make that, Run?

166
00:12:22,804 --> 00:12:23,774
Geh...

167
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:34,674
A-Again?!

168
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:37,644
Those two really get along, huh?

169
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,514
That's getting along?

170
00:12:42,154 --> 00:12:44,394
Our lunches were delicious, right, Toru?

171
00:12:44,394 --> 00:12:45,864
Yeah.

172
00:12:49,794 --> 00:12:51,824
Run, where do you think you're going?

173
00:12:52,964 --> 00:12:55,004
Our classroom is THIS way.

174
00:12:55,004 --> 00:12:58,944
Oh, that's right. We were freshmen
up till recently, so...

175
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,874
Move it, Run. Toru, you'll be late
if you don't hurry, too.

176
00:13:02,874 --> 00:13:04,864
Well, see you later, okay?

177
00:13:26,864 --> 00:13:28,704
Toru!

178
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:09,114
Run, you didn't fall asleep
in our afternoon classes, did you?

179
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,314
Nope! Afternoon was no problem.

180
00:14:11,314 --> 00:14:16,314
Almost fallin' woke you up a bit, huh?
You gotta be more careful.

181
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:16,974
'Kay.

182
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:21,224
I'M sleepier in the afternoon...

183
00:14:21,224 --> 00:14:22,354
Oh!

184
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:25,294
Want some candy to clear the sleep away? Here.

185
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,554
Thank you.

186
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,324
Here. You get one, too, Run.

187
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,094
Thank you!

188
00:14:40,474 --> 00:14:41,974
That's the last one.

189
00:14:41,974 --> 00:14:46,714
Oh. Then I'll save this for Toru.

190
00:14:47,114 --> 00:14:49,174
But that'd leave none for you.

191
00:14:49,484 --> 00:14:51,784
No, I'll split it with her.

192
00:14:51,784 --> 00:14:54,194
You're so thoughtful, Run!

193
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:57,154
How are you going to "split" that candy?

194
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,264
Oh, that's it!

195
00:15:03,634 --> 00:15:05,064
Box cutter!

196
00:15:05,534 --> 00:15:07,724
I wonder if this can cut it in half...

197
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:12,304
Don't push it. You'll look like a moron
if you hurt yourself over a piece of candy.

198
00:15:12,304 --> 00:15:13,704
I'll be fine.

199
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:18,534
Think it'll work?

200
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:32,994
It fell on the floor!

201
00:15:32,994 --> 00:15:34,964
What did I tell you?

202
00:15:34,964 --> 00:15:37,954
I thought it would be fine!

203
00:15:46,044 --> 00:15:47,234
Aoigaoka
High School

204
00:15:47,874 --> 00:15:49,034
Toru.

205
00:15:50,314 --> 00:15:51,674
Sorry for the wait.

206
00:15:54,584 --> 00:15:56,244
Well, let's go home.

207
00:16:02,124 --> 00:16:03,754
What's the matter, Toru?

208
00:16:05,094 --> 00:16:06,524
I smell candy.

209
00:16:13,204 --> 00:16:14,794
I smell the smell of candy.

210
00:16:15,034 --> 00:16:16,834
Huh? You had more?

211
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:17,804
Candy! Candy! Candy! Candy! Candy!

212
00:16:17,804 --> 00:16:19,004
No...
Candy! Candy! Candy! Candy! Candy!

213
00:16:19,004 --> 00:16:19,874
Candy! Candy! Candy! Candy! Candy!

214
00:16:20,304 --> 00:16:22,304
I forgot to throw the bag away.

215
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:27,784
That's incredible, Toru.
You could smell the empty bag?

216
00:16:27,784 --> 00:16:30,374
Because Toru loves sweets!

217
00:16:30,754 --> 00:16:36,124
Sorry. We all ate the last ones earlier.
I'll bring more next time.

218
00:16:36,124 --> 00:16:38,184
I'd like sugar candy!

219
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,794
Um, maybe something not so sweet...

220
00:16:41,994 --> 00:16:43,934
Or, something with fewer calories.

221
00:16:44,034 --> 00:16:46,764
Huh? But sweeter is tastier!

222
00:16:46,764 --> 00:16:49,164
Okay, I get it. I'll have more tomorrow.

223
00:16:52,704 --> 00:16:54,864
What'd you two choose for your electives?

224
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:56,634
What was that again?

225
00:16:56,744 --> 00:16:58,734
Miss Kamate told us about it, right?

226
00:16:59,014 --> 00:17:01,154
Run, that's when you were sleeping.

227
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:02,204
Ah.

228
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:05,684
Oh, is that right?

229
00:17:05,784 --> 00:17:08,484
So, Yuko, why did you slip?

230
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,824
Run looked like she'd fall over,
so I tried to catch her.

231
00:17:11,924 --> 00:17:15,194
Then Run suddenly stopped
and I lost my balance.

232
00:17:15,294 --> 00:17:19,594
So, Toru, what did you choose
for your freshman electives?

233
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:23,674
Toru?

234
00:17:32,244 --> 00:17:37,444
I want to take... the same class as you.

235
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:40,514
As YOU.

236
00:17:53,904 --> 00:17:55,594
It's all right.

237
00:18:01,644 --> 00:18:04,404
Nothing's changed between us.

238
00:18:06,914 --> 00:18:08,434
Yeah.

239
00:18:17,224 --> 00:18:19,994
You sure are cute, Toru.

240
00:18:19,994 --> 00:18:22,624
S-S-Stop!

241
00:18:24,964 --> 00:18:28,834
Say, Toru, wanna come hang out with us?

242
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:30,294
Let go of me.

243
00:18:30,904 --> 00:18:33,844
That's cruel, Yuko.
Let me have a squeeze of her, too.

244
00:18:34,204 --> 00:18:36,074
So soft!

245
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:41,514
Wh-what gives? Jeez!

246
00:18:44,584 --> 00:18:46,814

Hey, hey...

Run really has a lotta guy friends, huh?

268
00:21:03,124 --> 00:21:05,384
What'cha think they're talkin' about?

269
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:09,894
"Hey, tell us Yuko-chan's
measurements, Run-chan!"

270
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:15,054
"Keep it a secret, okay? From top to bottom,
it's 88 cm, 56 cm, 87 cm."

271
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:17,224
"Whoa! That's awesome!"

272
00:21:17,474 --> 00:21:19,064
Something like that, no?

273
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,234
Wh-Wh-Why do you know my
measurements, Nagi?!

274
00:21:24,914 --> 00:21:26,914
Uh, well, see you later, Run-chan.

00:21:28,114 --> 00:21:29,414
Later.

00:21:30,214 --> 00:21:33,744
Huh? They all took off.

278
00:21:40,124 --> 00:21:41,454
I get it.

279
00:21:42,264 --> 00:21:44,124
Ah! Toru!

280
00:21:45,034 --> 00:21:46,504
Run-chan.

281
00:21:49,704 --> 00:21:52,194
You're full of spunk every morning, huh, Toru?

282
00:21:54,404 --> 00:21:55,714
Toru.

283
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:58,004
I brought some candy, as promised.

284
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:01,434
Let's all have some later, okay?

285
00:22:08,854 --> 00:22:10,794

00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:12,264
No! Stoooop!

Yeah.

There's lots, lots of this long story left

292
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:10,354
But it's about time I have to get home

293
00:23:10,354 --> 00:23:13,654
Okay, see you tomorrow

00:23:47,854 --> 00:23:54,424
At the next corner, a bye-bye
while looking over our shoulders

301
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,294
yup!

There are different types of rain, aren't there?
Sprinkles, showers, teardrops o' rain...

304
00:24:01,304 --> 00:24:03,404
That's right. You sure know a lot, don't you?

305
00:24:03,404 --> 00:24:05,074
Note: Miporin is a nickname; Miho is her real name.
Now here's a quiz, Miporin!

306
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:05,274
Now here's a quiz, Miporin!

307
00:24:05,274 --> 00:24:05,744
What is it?

308
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,774
Well, WHO are we?

309
00:24:07,774 --> 00:24:10,744
Wait, you just revealed my name, didn't you?

310
00:24:10,744 --> 00:24:13,684
Ruh-roh! I, Yutaka, made a serious error...
