1
00:00:08,204 --> 00:00:10,904
Summer vacation will be over soon, huh?

2
00:00:12,444 --> 00:00:13,274
Yeah.

3
00:00:13,644 --> 00:00:17,384
Then school will start, huh? I can't wait!

4
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:18,484
You can't wait?

5
00:00:18,484 --> 00:00:21,274
Because then we can see everyone from class.

6
00:00:21,754 --> 00:00:23,044
Everyone from class...

7
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:24,084
Torun!

8
00:00:24,084 --> 00:00:26,314
Darn it, Yutaka!
Torun!

9
00:00:28,424 --> 00:00:31,014
Jeez, I lost again.

10
00:00:31,394 --> 00:00:33,154
Say, Run-chan...

11
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:38,164
You always have guys around you. Why is that?

12
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:42,904
Really? I don't think that's true, but...
I wonder why.

13
00:00:42,904 --> 00:00:46,304
No one's c-confessed to you?

14
00:00:46,404 --> 00:00:49,944
Confessed? Come to think of it, not long ago...

15
00:00:49,944 --> 00:00:51,174
Huh? It happened?!

16
00:00:51,944 --> 00:00:53,544
Mr. Sato did.

17
00:00:54,384 --> 00:00:55,354
Huh?

18
00:00:55,354 --> 00:01:01,844
He said, "That's what I like" and gave me this.
Strange for someone to like candles, isn't it?

19
00:01:07,264 --> 00:01:11,064
I don't think that means he likes candles.

20
00:01:11,234 --> 00:01:12,664
Huh?

21
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:27,784
Cloudy and ephemeral

22
00:01:27,784 --> 00:01:36,524
Becoming one with the glittering, faraway sky

23
00:01:36,524 --> 00:01:44,624
My wind-reading, willful destination is far away

24
00:01:45,164 --> 00:01:48,304
Let's go together

25
00:01:48,304 --> 00:01:54,004
I'll inhale deeply and go, the world's spring breath

26
00:01:54,274 --> 00:01:59,404
The smiling faces of everyone gathered in the sun

27
00:02:00,114 --> 00:02:06,854
In between "Good morning" and
"Goodbye," there is only us

28
00:02:06,854 --> 00:02:10,414
We can do anything, can't we?

29
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:16,524
Transparent beams of sunlight, a newborn sky

30
00:02:16,734 --> 00:02:22,634
A morning arch at which we promised to meet

31
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:30,134
To you, waving your hand, I'll give a special today

32
00:02:30,314 --> 00:02:33,544
And the talking will begin

33
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,524

Oh. They do this every year, don't they?
The fireworks festival.

39
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,074
They do?

40
00:02:59,074 --> 00:03:01,234
There are lots of food stalls, so it's very busy.

41
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,844
Huh, it's this weekend.

42
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:08,444
It's the end of summer vacation, too.
I'd like to go to a festival with you all!

43
00:03:08,714 --> 00:03:10,184
Right?

44
00:03:10,354 --> 00:03:12,224
We can all wear summer kimonos.

45
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:13,594
Let's do it!

46
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:14,524
Yeah.

47
00:03:14,524 --> 00:03:16,924
Well, why not?

48
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,954
Okay, it's settled!

49
00:03:21,494 --> 00:03:24,564
So, what are we gonna do next?

50
00:03:24,564 --> 00:03:25,964
I hadn't thought about it.

51
00:03:25,964 --> 00:03:28,404
It's hot, so I don't want to move.

52
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:31,434
Oh! Wanna all go do karaoke?

53
00:03:32,444 --> 00:03:34,044
Karaoke, huh?

54
00:03:34,044 --> 00:03:37,444
Karaoke? Nice. I love it!

55
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,754
Yuko, you like karaoke?

56
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:44,444
Yeah. I can sing most of what
I've had as ringtones.

57
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:47,724
Which ones do you like, Run?

58
00:03:47,724 --> 00:03:52,214
Well... That place's jambalaya is undefeated!

59
00:03:52,294 --> 00:03:54,934
Their ramen is an ambush-in-waiting, too!

60
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:58,494
Oh, and their parfaits and
ice creams are big sizes!

61
00:03:59,934 --> 00:04:02,834
Huh? Aren't we going to karaoke?

62
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:04,504
Yup! Karaoke.

63
00:04:07,044 --> 00:04:08,074

00:04:09,044 --> 00:04:09,604
A little cramped, isn't it?

66
00:04:09,714 --> 00:04:13,874
Well, I'm gonna order the food and drinks.
What are you all getting?

67
00:04:14,084 --> 00:04:15,684
I'll have a melon soda.

68
00:04:15,684 --> 00:04:17,204
Grapefruit juice.

69
00:04:18,254 --> 00:04:20,274
Toru, what do you want to drink?

70
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:22,424
Um, an iced tea.

71
00:04:22,424 --> 00:04:23,914
With pleasure!

72
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,664
Ah, hello? I'd like to place an order.

73
00:04:26,664 --> 00:04:28,064
They already have this month's new songs.

Gotta put in the next one.

Does she want something in particular?

97
00:05:55,514 --> 00:05:58,074
Um, take your time to choose, Toru.

98
00:06:01,024 --> 00:06:03,054

00:11:02,524 --> 00:11:03,954
Three left.

184
00:11:04,324 --> 00:11:06,524
Oh, that wasn't very nice.

185
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,724
So, no one's put a song in?

186
00:11:09,994 --> 00:11:12,394
Oh, I'll put one in.

187
00:11:12,604 --> 00:11:15,124
Do it AFTER you're done eating.

188
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:16,174
Okay, what to do for the next song?

189
00:11:16,174 --> 00:11:18,974
Okay, what to do for the next song?
Tada shinjitai
I just want to believe

190
00:11:18,974 --> 00:11:20,374
Tada shinjitai
I just want to believe

191
00:11:21,674 --> 00:11:22,974
Next door, huh?

192
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,744
But it was empty.

193
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:26,114
Maybe they just came.

194
00:11:26,114 --> 00:11:28,754
Ima, kimi no te...
Right now, your hand...

195
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:31,824
Wow. Whoever's next door is good, huh?

196
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,184
Still, this song is kinda stifling, huh?

197
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,664
Oh, it's started.

198
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:41,354
Run-chan! You mustn't sing.

199
00:11:41,564 --> 00:11:43,094
Huh? Why?

200
00:11:43,094 --> 00:11:43,864
Just because.

201
00:11:43,864 --> 00:11:44,634
Huh?

202
00:11:44,634 --> 00:11:45,464
Toru!

203
00:11:45,464 --> 00:11:46,364
Shh!

204
00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:50,404
Mitsukedashita kotae mou sugu
Soon enough, you should realize

205
00:11:50,404 --> 00:11:51,404
Could it be?
Mitsukedashita kotae mou sugu
Soon enough, you should realize

206
00:11:51,404 --> 00:11:52,644
Mitsukedashita kotae mou sugu
Soon enough, you should realize

207
00:11:52,644 --> 00:11:53,574
That voice...
Mitsukedashita kotae mou sugu
Soon enough, you should realize

208
00:11:53,574 --> 00:11:53,874
Mitsukedashita kotae mou sugu
Soon enough, you should realize

209
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:57,644
Wakaru hazu sa
The answer I discovered

210
00:11:58,414 --> 00:11:59,714
What?

211
00:11:59,714 --> 00:12:00,774
What, what?

212
00:12:06,054 --> 00:12:08,784
Sure would love to do karaoke with Run-chan...

213
00:12:09,054 --> 00:12:10,624
Okay, come on!

214
00:12:10,624 --> 00:12:12,324
One more time!

215
00:12:13,624 --> 00:12:19,654
Yurete, yurete, yurete
Waver, waver, waver

216
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:24,234
Mujaki na sono hitomi
Those eyes, so innocent...

217
00:12:26,474 --> 00:12:28,234
Karaoke was fun, huh?

218
00:12:28,844 --> 00:12:30,574
Let's go again, okay?

219
00:12:31,414 --> 00:12:33,144
I want to get good at singing.

220
00:12:34,614 --> 00:12:38,884
Oh, that's right! They showed how go be
a good singer on TV the other day.

221
00:12:48,664 --> 00:12:51,564
It's been a while since I've worn
a summer kimono to a festival.

222
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:53,634
It's gonna be fun, huh?

223
00:12:53,634 --> 00:12:56,834
I have a few different kimonos.
Which one do you want?

224
00:12:56,834 --> 00:12:59,894
This is nice, this chic-looking color.
It looks grown-up.

225
00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:01,374
Which one?

226
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,174
Did I even have one this color?

227
00:13:06,714 --> 00:13:09,044
This has gotten moldy and the color's changed.

228
00:13:13,154 --> 00:13:14,714
These just won't do, huh?

229
00:13:15,124 --> 00:13:17,964
Maybe my old ones will be your size.

230
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,924
I'll go get them.

231
00:13:26,564 --> 00:13:30,524
Grown up-looking mule sandals...
Maybe they're Run's mother's.

232
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:35,494
With those, I might get up to a
hundred and centimeters.

233
00:13:41,184 --> 00:13:43,274
At this rate, I'll never be a grownup!

234
00:13:47,454 --> 00:13:48,944
Mom!

235
00:13:50,554 --> 00:13:51,584
Oh, my!

236
00:13:51,824 --> 00:13:55,464
Look. We got dressed up! What do you think?

237
00:13:55,464 --> 00:14:00,164
Today's the festival, isn't it?
You're so cute and vibrant!

238
00:14:00,164 --> 00:14:02,374
They look wonderful, on both of you.

239
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:03,634
Yaay!

240
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,204
Thank you very much.

241
00:14:05,204 --> 00:14:09,974
But the festival's not till tonight, right?
It's still 10:00 am.

242
00:14:16,484 --> 00:14:18,514
We got too carried away!

243
00:14:27,994 --> 00:14:29,554
There they are!

244
00:14:30,234 --> 00:14:31,134
Oh.

245
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,564
Sorry for the wait.

246
00:14:33,564 --> 00:14:35,094
Okay, we're all here.

247
00:14:35,404 --> 00:14:38,604
Yuko-chan, you really are cute
no matter what you wear, huh?

248
00:14:38,604 --> 00:14:39,504
No...

249
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:43,304
And Nagi, you're... Oh, you curled your hair!

250
00:14:43,544 --> 00:14:44,544
You're right.

251
00:14:44,544 --> 00:14:45,944
Oh, she did.

252
00:14:45,944 --> 00:14:47,384
It's cute!

253
00:14:47,384 --> 00:14:50,754
Um, well... Sometimes, you know...

254
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:55,654
Uh, there's still time before the fireworks,
so let's kill time by checking out the stalls.

255
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,724
Can we go to the mask stall first?

256
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:00,994
Oh, yeah.

257
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:06,534
Huh. You like kids' anime, do you?

258
00:15:06,534 --> 00:15:07,764
No.

259
00:15:10,804 --> 00:15:15,764
I get handed lots of samples at the stalls
in the shopping arcade. Not good.

260
00:15:16,114 --> 00:15:17,774
Oh...

261
00:15:19,484 --> 00:15:21,034
A candy apple!

262
00:15:22,684 --> 00:15:23,784
Candy apple...

263
00:15:23,784 --> 00:15:26,584
Yuko-chan, can I have a bite?

264
00:15:26,584 --> 00:15:28,284
Sure. Here!

265
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:30,924
It's delicious!

266
00:15:31,724 --> 00:15:34,294
Huh? Toru, you want some?

267
00:15:34,294 --> 00:15:35,264
Not really.

268
00:15:35,264 --> 00:15:36,284
Oh?

269
00:15:36,494 --> 00:15:38,724
Run, lemme have some of your cotton candy.

270
00:15:38,934 --> 00:15:39,834
Sure!

271
00:15:43,474 --> 00:15:45,164
Delicious!

272
00:15:46,474 --> 00:15:47,374
Huh?

273
00:15:47,374 --> 00:15:48,864
HUH?!

274
00:15:57,214 --> 00:15:59,484
Yuko-chan and Nagi are doing the ring toss.

275
00:15:59,954 --> 00:16:01,124
Ah! I got third place!

276
00:16:01,124 --> 00:16:01,424
7th

Ah! I got third place!

277
00:16:01,424 --> 00:16:02,624

Place
5th

Congratulations.

278
00:16:02,624 --> 00:16:04,184
Here. It's a fireworks set.

279
00:16:05,124 --> 00:16:07,924
We came to see fireworks,
but your prize is fireworks...

280
00:16:08,064 --> 00:16:10,694
All right! I'M up next!

281
00:16:10,694 --> 00:16:13,064
I'm aiming for first place. Hyaa!

282
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:41,564
Huh?

283
00:16:41,564 --> 00:16:44,464
I've already spent this much money?

284
00:16:44,464 --> 00:16:48,604
These stalls are expensive, huh?
You gotta be careful with your money.

285
00:16:48,604 --> 00:16:52,104
Worst case, you get to where
you can't buy anything else.

286
00:16:52,104 --> 00:16:55,134
But when you see something, you want it, huh?

287
00:16:56,374 --> 00:17:01,614
In that case, just have a plan, and buy things
you can enjoy for a long time.

288
00:17:04,884 --> 00:17:06,444
Cookie cutting?

289
00:17:06,724 --> 00:17:10,314
Nagi! Why don't we do somethin'
we can all enjoy together?

290
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:15,394
You've never done cookie cutting,
have you? It's fun...

291
00:17:16,764 --> 00:17:18,564
Wanna give it a shot?

292
00:17:19,504 --> 00:17:21,234
It will be my first time.

293
00:17:21,234 --> 00:17:23,864
Then let's try an easy-looking one.

294
00:17:24,074 --> 00:17:29,514
Skrch Skrch Skrch Skrch

295
00:17:29,514 --> 00:17:30,074
Skrch Skrch Skrch Skrch
Ah!

296
00:17:30,074 --> 00:17:30,474
Ah!

297
00:17:30,714 --> 00:17:32,484
It broke!

298
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:33,774
Sir, one more.

299
00:17:33,884 --> 00:17:35,284
Sure thing.

300
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:41,054
Skrch Skrch Skrch Skrch

301
00:17:41,624 --> 00:17:43,614
This is pretty hard, isn't it?

302
00:17:49,064 --> 00:17:50,394
Come on, hurry.

303
00:17:50,394 --> 00:17:53,304
I harn't ertn yakisba y't!

304
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:59,734
Ladies and gentlemen, the fireworks
demonstration will soon begin.

305
00:18:06,214 --> 00:18:07,804
The fireworks already started?!

306
00:18:09,114 --> 00:18:10,744
Everyone, let's hurry!

307
00:18:12,854 --> 00:18:14,494
So many people...

308
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:15,854
I know a good place.

309
00:18:16,154 --> 00:18:19,254
Let's run to higher ground.
There's a spot up there!

310
00:18:20,294 --> 00:18:22,724
Nagi! Never mind the cookie cutting!

311
00:18:23,994 --> 00:18:26,664
My gourd!

312
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,574
It's right up these stairs!

313
00:18:35,974 --> 00:18:39,104
Suddenly, I don't really care about fireworks.

314
00:18:39,344 --> 00:18:41,314
Nagi, let's go.

315
00:18:51,794 --> 00:18:52,724
I'm done for!

316
00:18:52,724 --> 00:18:54,214
Keep pushing, Nagi-chan!

317
00:18:58,364 --> 00:18:59,834
Let's make it!

318
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:03,834
We're here!

319
00:19:22,254 --> 00:19:23,654
A bunch at once!

320
00:19:24,594 --> 00:19:26,254
I-incredible...

321
00:20:00,624 --> 00:20:04,964
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes
the fireworks demonstration.

322
00:20:05,264 --> 00:20:07,234
When leaving, please take all trash with you,
or dispose of it in the designated trash areas.

323
00:20:07,234 --> 00:20:08,264
What?
When leaving, please take all trash with you,
or dispose of it in the designated trash areas.

324
00:20:08,634 --> 00:20:11,074
It's... over.

325
00:20:11,074 --> 00:20:12,104
No...

326
00:20:12,104 --> 00:20:15,704
Just getting that at the end wasn't quite enough.

327
00:20:15,844 --> 00:20:17,814
It's kinda sad, huh?

328
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:18,844
Oh.

329
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:21,784
That's right! We got fireworks
from that stall earlier!

330
00:20:21,784 --> 00:20:23,974
Yes! Great job, Yuko!

331
00:20:24,214 --> 00:20:25,684
But we have no lighter.

332
00:20:27,084 --> 00:20:28,384
No problem!

333
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:29,554
Matches?

334
00:20:29,554 --> 00:20:30,654
A candle?

335
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,154
You brought those?

336
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:39,524
How come this only has sparklers in it?!

337
00:20:39,904 --> 00:20:41,464
Pretty plain, huh?

338
00:20:44,134 --> 00:20:48,134
But, you know, I like sparklers.

339
00:20:52,814 --> 00:20:54,374
I guess.

340
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:57,344
Yeah. They're pretty.

341
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,394
Delicious, isn't it?

342
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,864
You're eating too much.

343
00:21:13,934 --> 00:21:16,974
M-Mr. Sato! Why?

344
00:21:16,974 --> 00:21:18,964
Well, why not?

345
00:21:19,804 --> 00:21:21,644
Please don't come near me!

346
00:21:21,644 --> 00:21:24,074
That's MY line.

347
00:21:24,614 --> 00:21:28,214
By the way, you came to the festival alone?

348
00:21:28,214 --> 00:21:30,274
I'm not alone!

349
00:21:30,684 --> 00:21:32,414
Another beer, please.

350
00:21:33,024 --> 00:21:34,574
But you ARE alone.

351
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:38,094
I'm telling you, I'm not!

352
00:21:38,194 --> 00:21:39,424
Again with this...

353
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,804
Summer vacation was fun, huh?

354
00:21:56,044 --> 00:21:57,374
I guess so.

355
00:21:57,374 --> 00:21:59,484
And we went to the beach.

356
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,744
Let's watch the fireworks next year, too.

357
00:22:02,014 --> 00:22:03,574
Yeah.

358
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:06,244
Next time, I WILL win at cookie-cutting!

359
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:08,324
That again?

360
00:22:08,324 --> 00:22:10,754
What's with you? It was fun, right?

361
00:22:11,054 --> 00:22:15,394
Yeah! It was better than I thought. Right, Toru?

362
00:22:18,134 --> 00:22:19,564
Yeah.

363
00:22:19,664 --> 00:22:21,604
It was fun.

364
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:47,024
Silhouettes, taller than us,
line against the madder tree

365
00:22:47,024 --> 00:22:53,994
The end to an enjoyable day

366
00:22:55,834 --> 00:23:03,014
There's lots, lots of this long story left

367
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:10,354
But it's about time I have to get home

368
00:23:10,354 --> 00:23:13,654
Okay, see you tomorrow

369
00:23:13,884 --> 00:23:17,184
I'll e-mail you

370
00:23:17,554 --> 00:23:24,834
On today's page, everyone had matching smiles

371
00:23:24,834 --> 00:23:28,134
Okay, see you tomorrow

372
00:23:28,504 --> 00:23:31,804
Thanks for everything

373
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:40,684
I'm glad we could be together again today

374
00:23:40,684 --> 00:23:47,854
La-la-laa, humming to our hearts and the wind

375
00:23:47,854 --> 00:23:54,424
At the next corner, a bye-bye
while looking over our shoulders

376
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,934
yup!!

377
00:23:57,934 --> 00:23:59,504
When you think of the
end of August, you think of...

378
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:00,164
Cicadas!

379
00:24:00,164 --> 00:24:00,964
Typhoons!

380
00:24:00,964 --> 00:24:02,304
Summer homework.

381
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,304
My dad making craftworks for me!

382
00:24:04,304 --> 00:24:06,044
Taking photos at the houses
of kids who've finished!

383
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,844
Taking an obviously fake photo...

384
00:24:07,844 --> 00:24:10,644
Writing your journal in a hurry,
not remembering what the weather was like.

385
00:24:10,644 --> 00:24:12,674
Seeing old newspapers being
collected right in front of you.

386
00:24:14,184 --> 00:24:17,084
I'd like to see an episode
like that on this show, Mr. bb!

387
00:24:17,084 --> 00:24:18,124
