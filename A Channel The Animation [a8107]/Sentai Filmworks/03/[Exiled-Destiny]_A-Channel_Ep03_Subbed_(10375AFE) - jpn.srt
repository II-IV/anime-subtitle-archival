1
00:00:07,404 --> 00:00:09,234
Good morning, Run-chan.

2
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:11,144
Good morning.

3
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:12,644
Got your panties on?

4
00:00:12,644 --> 00:00:15,704
Of course! No more sleepyhead mistakes for me!

5
00:00:17,014 --> 00:00:19,174
C'mon, let's go!

6
00:00:23,214 --> 00:00:24,654
Run-chan...

7
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,764
Cloudy and ephemeral

8
00:00:39,764 --> 00:00:48,514
Becoming one with the glittering, faraway sky

9
00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:56,614
My wind-reading, willful destination is far away

10
00:00:57,154 --> 00:01:00,294
Let's go together

11
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:05,994
I'll inhale deeply and go, the world's spring breath

12
00:01:06,264 --> 00:01:11,394
The smiling faces of everyone gathered in the sun

13
00:01:12,104 --> 00:01:18,844
In between "Good morning" and
"Goodbye," there is only us

14
00:01:18,844 --> 00:01:22,404
We can do anything, can't we?

15
00:01:22,774 --> 00:01:28,514
Transparent beams of sunlight, a newborn sky

16
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:34,624
A morning arch at which we promised to meet

17
00:01:34,624 --> 00:01:42,124
To you, waving your hand, I'll give a special today

18
00:01:42,294 --> 00:01:45,524
And the talking will begin

19
00:02:08,024 --> 00:02:10,924
Sure enough, fizzy drinks really wake you up!

20
00:02:10,924 --> 00:02:12,824
Normally it's COFFEE, though.

21
00:02:12,824 --> 00:02:17,504
It is? But they're bubbly and make my
eyes sparkly, so they wake me up in a flash!

22
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:18,764
Is that how it goes?

23
00:02:19,104 --> 00:02:19,764
Hyaa!

24
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:22,204
Nice shot.

25
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:26,704
Come to think of it, I haven't seen Toru today.

26
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:30,514
She has class duties today,
so she'll be busy till afternoon.

27
00:02:30,514 --> 00:02:31,534
Oh...

28
00:02:32,014 --> 00:02:35,454
We're always together,
so with her gone, it's kinda lonely.

29
00:02:35,654 --> 00:02:39,014
Yeah. But if she has class duties,
it can't be helped.

30
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:41,674
Oh.

31
00:02:42,354 --> 00:02:44,184
What's wrong, Nagi?

32
00:02:45,194 --> 00:02:48,064
Say... Don't you want to have a look?

33
00:02:49,194 --> 00:02:50,294
At what?

34
00:02:51,034 --> 00:02:53,574
Toru the freshman!

35
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:54,874
Toru Nagi
A-CHANNEL
Yuko
Run

36
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:58,534
CLASSMATES

37
00:02:59,474 --> 00:03:02,144
Ah! Look at this graffiti!

38
00:03:02,144 --> 00:03:03,944
It's still there.

39
00:03:04,314 --> 00:03:08,374
They can't get rid of it because it's carved,
I guess. Anyway, let's get a move on.

40
00:03:09,984 --> 00:03:11,184
Hey, wait!

41
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:17,584
Freshman-year classrooms...
Takes you back, huh?

42
00:03:17,794 --> 00:03:20,164
It wasn't that long ago, though.

43
00:03:20,164 --> 00:03:23,694
Ah! Ain't that it? Toru's classroom.

44
00:03:28,034 --> 00:03:33,064
What's Toru like in class?
Do you think she's scared?

45
00:03:33,274 --> 00:03:35,814
Toru's actually a top student.

46
00:03:35,814 --> 00:03:38,344
No way! I imagine her just running wild.

47
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:43,654
Yeah! S-swinging a bat around,
staining the classroom with blood...

48
00:03:43,654 --> 00:03:45,624
I don't think she's doing that.

49
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:48,354
Ma'am, I'm finished.

50
00:03:48,524 --> 00:03:50,864
Thank you as always.

51
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:57,534
Um, the number of boys on here was wrong,
so I corrected it. Is that all right?

52
00:03:57,534 --> 00:04:01,304
Oh, really? That was my mistake.

53
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,974
Thank you. You were a big help.

54
00:04:03,974 --> 00:04:05,874
No, not at all.

55
00:04:06,174 --> 00:04:08,374
TO~ORU!

56
00:04:09,444 --> 00:04:13,384
"Not at all," she says. What a good girl!

57
00:04:13,384 --> 00:04:16,354
The teacher counts on you, huh?
You little so-and-so!

58
00:04:16,354 --> 00:04:16,384
Why are they
here?
The teacher counts on you, huh?
You little so-and-so!

59
00:04:16,384 --> 00:04:18,354
Why are they
here?

60
00:04:21,954 --> 00:04:23,054
Um...

61
00:04:24,224 --> 00:04:27,954
I forgot my textbook,
so do you mind if I see yours?

62
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,264
Sure.

63
00:04:29,264 --> 00:04:30,734
Thank you very much!

64
00:04:35,874 --> 00:04:39,774
Sorry. I forgot my contacts today.

65
00:04:39,774 --> 00:04:42,334
O-oh.

66
00:04:42,944 --> 00:04:44,884
Argh, I can't see!

67
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:46,844
TOO
CLOSE

68
00:04:50,384 --> 00:04:54,654
Thank you very much! You were a big help!

69
00:04:55,024 --> 00:04:55,724
No problem.

70
00:04:55,724 --> 00:04:58,124
My name is Yutaka.

71
00:04:58,124 --> 00:05:03,094
The truth is, I've wanted to talk to you for a long,
long time! But I never had the chance.

72
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,464
Ah.

73
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,604
From now on, let's be friends...

74
00:05:07,604 --> 00:05:07,874
Torun!

75
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:08,674
TORUN
Torun!

76
00:05:08,674 --> 00:05:08,964
Torun!

77
00:05:14,674 --> 00:05:18,214
I'll buy you a drink as proof we've gotten closer!

78
00:05:18,214 --> 00:05:18,884
Wait...

79
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:20,144
What was that?

80
00:05:26,324 --> 00:05:28,344
Huh? Toru?

81
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:37,034
What's the matter?

82
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:44,304
Whoa. This is unusual.

83
00:05:45,774 --> 00:05:48,314
GRIND GRIND
A-ain't that a little tight?

84
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,114
GRIND GRIND
Ow ow ow ow ow ow!

85
00:05:50,114 --> 00:05:51,514
GRIND GRIND
What's wrong with Toru?

86
00:05:51,514 --> 00:05:52,414
GRIND GRIND
Beats me.

87
00:05:56,054 --> 00:05:59,574
Sorry for the wait, Torun!
I went and bought us some more!

88
00:06:00,054 --> 00:06:03,924
Huh? Torun? Where did you go? Torun!

89
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,744
Um, excuse me.

90
00:06:35,824 --> 00:06:37,054
Sorry?

91
00:06:42,794 --> 00:06:43,664
Your forehead is pretty. It's very nice.

92
00:06:43,664 --> 00:06:46,164
Run's talking to some strange guy.
Your forehead is pretty. It's very nice.

93
00:06:46,164 --> 00:06:47,204
Oh, thank you.

94
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:47,504
Like...
Oh, thank you.

95
00:06:47,504 --> 00:06:47,674
Like...

96
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:48,174
Like...
In any case, where might the nurse's office be?

97
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:48,534
In any case, where might the nurse's office be?

98
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,134
What's with that shirt?
In any case, where might the nurse's office be?

99
00:06:50,134 --> 00:06:51,204
That way.

100
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:52,874
I see. Thank you.

101
00:06:52,874 --> 00:06:54,504
Well, see you.

102
00:06:56,144 --> 00:06:57,784
Nagi-chan!

103
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,514
Hey, who was that?

104
00:06:59,514 --> 00:07:03,754
The new school nurse, he said.
It looks like he got lost.

105
00:07:03,754 --> 00:07:08,124
Oh, is that it? I thought
he was some suspicious guy.

106
00:07:08,354 --> 00:07:12,524
Also, he said my forehead
was pretty and very nice!

107
00:07:12,994 --> 00:07:15,864
Isn't that a bit strange?

108
00:07:16,864 --> 00:07:20,234
Huh. A new school nurse?

109
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:21,034
He looks pretty suspicious.

110
00:07:21,034 --> 00:07:23,064
School Nurse
Mr. Sato
He looks pretty suspicious.

111
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,734
But I think he'll be popular with the girls, and...

112
00:07:27,174 --> 00:07:28,614
There he is again!

113
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,184
Thank you for earlier. You were a big help.

114
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,474
Not at all. No need to thank me!

115
00:07:33,544 --> 00:07:36,514
Say, you should come have some fun
in the nurse's office.

116
00:07:36,514 --> 00:07:38,714
I'll get a special bed ready.

117
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:41,014
You're funny!

118
00:07:41,224 --> 00:07:42,954
Come by anytime.

119
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,954
Something's been moving around since earlier...

120
00:07:58,674 --> 00:08:00,004
Who are you?

121
00:08:00,004 --> 00:08:02,074
Don't be so casual with Run-chan!

122
00:08:02,074 --> 00:08:07,084
Huh. So you're "Run-chan," eh?
Mind if I call you that?

123
00:08:07,084 --> 00:08:07,914
Sure!

124
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:11,024
Ah. "Run-chan."

125
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,044
How cute. Run-CHAN.

126
00:08:14,124 --> 00:08:16,754
You look like a sea urchin,
so you're Urchin-chan.

127
00:08:19,364 --> 00:08:21,134
She sure looks depressed...

128
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,534
It's like showing kindness to the enemy.

129
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:28,164
That really is cute, Run-chan. Your forehead.

130
00:08:28,304 --> 00:08:30,034
Thank you very much!

131
00:08:30,404 --> 00:08:33,304
That's right. It really is...

132
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:37,304
Really is... Oh, yes...

133
00:08:40,984 --> 00:08:42,314
Get away from Run-chan!

134
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:48,194
M-my apologies. It's time for my medicine.

135
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,684
Oh. He has a weak constitution.

136
00:08:53,794 --> 00:08:57,594
That's right. Look at THIS! Ta-daa!

137
00:08:58,434 --> 00:09:00,934
Note: A single by okinawan artist Cocco that came out in 1996 and was a
big hit; the phrase was later adopted as the slogan for Tower Records.
"No music, no life"!

138
00:09:00,934 --> 00:09:01,104
Note: A single by okinawan artist Cocco that came out in 1996 and was a
big hit; the phrase was later adopted as the slogan for Tower Records.

Note: A single by okinawan artist Cocco that came out in 1996 and was a
big hit; the phrase was later adopted as the slogan for Tower Records.
Whoa! You bought one of the
limited-edition-color models!

140
00:09:03,034 --> 00:09:04,504
Whoa! You bought one of the
limited-edition-color models!

141
00:09:04,504 --> 00:09:06,004
Oh, I did?

142
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:09,474
Nice. I really want one, too.

143
00:09:09,474 --> 00:09:11,074
You sure are high tech!

144
00:09:11,314 --> 00:09:13,444
What kinds of songs do you listen to, Run?

145
00:09:14,584 --> 00:09:16,444
Um...

146
00:09:16,714 --> 00:09:19,184
I still have a no-music life.

147
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,814
You haven't entered any songs?

148
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:29,224
I tried different ways, but I couldn't put
any songs on it, so I thought it was broken.

149
00:09:29,794 --> 00:09:30,734
Like that...

150
00:09:30,734 --> 00:09:31,134
MD Combo Unit
Like that...

151
00:09:31,134 --> 00:09:31,634
MD Combo Unit

152
00:09:31,634 --> 00:09:31,864
It won't
connect...
MD Combo Unit

153
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:32,094
It won't
connect...

154
00:09:33,104 --> 00:09:34,204
And this...

155
00:09:34,204 --> 00:09:34,304
Cassette
And this...

156
00:09:34,304 --> 00:09:34,504

158
00:09:36,134 --> 00:09:37,604
And that...

159
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:39,774
Like
with a
TV

160
00:09:39,774 --> 00:09:41,404
Slap it
at a
with a
TV

161
00:09:41,474 --> 00:09:42,674
Yeah...

162
00:09:45,314 --> 00:09:47,254
But sure enough, it didn't work!

163
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,254
What was that last thing?! The last one!

164
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:50,824
You took it apart?!

165
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,844
Well, I thought it was broken.

166
00:09:52,984 --> 00:09:54,884
You thought an amateur like you could fix it?!

167
00:09:55,124 --> 00:09:58,214
There are other options,
like sending it to the manufacturer!

168
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:01,464
Just calm down. It's not like it was yours.

169
00:10:01,464 --> 00:10:04,204
If it were mine, I'd take YOU apart!

170
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,764
It's all right.

171
00:10:05,764 --> 00:10:08,574
I'm not broken, so that wouldn't be necessary.

172
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,734
That's not what I mean!

173
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:15,844
It turned on!

174
00:10:15,844 --> 00:10:17,774
Ah, thank goodness.

175
00:10:18,044 --> 00:10:22,644
Run, you gotta use a computer
to put songs on that.

176
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,214
Huh?

177
00:10:29,654 --> 00:10:31,294
I don't have one.

178
00:10:31,294 --> 00:10:32,784
Then why did you buy that?!

179
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:39,434
Um, where do you go
whenever you have free time?

180
00:10:42,904 --> 00:10:45,934
I won't let go until you tell me.

181
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:58,984
I-It's not true! Torun, wait!

182
00:10:59,854 --> 00:11:03,224
I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Are you mad?

183
00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:04,854
I'm not mad.

184
00:11:06,664 --> 00:11:09,094
It's so stretched out...

185
00:11:09,094 --> 00:11:11,504
It will shrink when I wash it.

186
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,404
No. We must use it like THIS!

187
00:11:19,174 --> 00:11:23,544
Now then, where shall we go?
I, Yutaka, will take you there!

188
00:11:27,884 --> 00:11:29,144
Run-chan...

189
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:39,284
Oh. She has PE next, does she?

190
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:49,404
Todokisou nanoni todokanai kankei
A relationship that looks like it will reach you, but doesn't

191
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:56,834
Nani ga hitsuyou? Nani ga tarinai?
What is required? What is there not enough of?

192
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:17,864
Sagasanakutemo honto wa shitteru
The truth is, you know even without searching

193
00:12:17,864 --> 00:12:24,944
Hon no sukoshi no yuuki to tsuyogari
Just a little courage and bravery

194
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:28,644
(I miss you) Ke-tai nara ima sugu ni
(I miss you) on the cell phone, right now

195
00:12:28,644 --> 00:12:31,784
(I miss you) Koe no kimi ni wa aeru kedo
(I miss you) I can "meet" you in voice

196
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:35,354
(Hold me tight) Boku ga kowarechau kurai
(Hold me tight) But I want you to squeeze me

197
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:38,484
(Don't you feel me?) Gyutto shite hoshii nda
(Don't you feel me?) So tight I could break

198
00:12:38,484 --> 00:12:39,054
Calmly
and
Quietly
(Don't you feel me?) Gyutto shite hoshii nda
(Don't you feel me?) So tight I could break

199
00:12:39,054 --> 00:12:42,294
Calmly
and
Quietly
(I miss you) Ima sugu ni demo aitai
(I miss you) I want to see you, right now

200
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,494
Calmly
and
Quietly
(This ain't right) Koi to wa dokoka chigau kedo
(This ain't right) It's different from love, somehow

201
00:12:44,494 --> 00:12:45,894
(This ain't right) Koi to wa dokoka chigau kedo
(This ain't right) It's different from love, somehow

202
00:12:45,894 --> 00:12:49,634
Koko ni ite kurenakya imi ga nai yo
If you aren't here for me, it all means nothing

203
00:12:49,634 --> 00:12:53,864
Dakara gyutto shite hoshii nda (Never get enough)
So I want you to squeeze me (Never get enough)

204
00:12:53,934 --> 00:12:55,334
Run-chan...

205
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:02,804
In the end,
it was Toru's job
to put songs on it

206
00:13:06,314 --> 00:13:08,114
IN USE

207
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,404
I mean...

208
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,124
STILL using these tiny things
in this day and age is just strange.

209
00:13:14,124 --> 00:13:15,684
True enough.

210
00:13:16,124 --> 00:13:18,324
Other schools use knee-length shorts.

211
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:27,754
These things are little more than panties!
Putting them on though we're wearing panties...

212
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,804
It's panties on panties!

213
00:13:29,804 --> 00:13:30,564
Nagi?

214
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:33,704
Having class in our panties is just strange!

215
00:13:34,444 --> 00:13:37,074
Are you not embarrassed
because they're not panties?

216
00:13:37,144 --> 00:13:38,734
It IS embarrassing!

217
00:13:40,614 --> 00:13:43,484
You're more embarrassing than our shorts.

218
00:13:43,714 --> 00:13:47,014
Yelling that over and over
makes you sound like you like it.

219
00:13:48,754 --> 00:13:51,024
Aaand begin warm-up exercises!

220
00:13:51,724 --> 00:13:52,714
Hup!

221
00:13:54,864 --> 00:13:55,664
Say...

222
00:13:55,664 --> 00:13:57,594
What is it, Yuko-chan?

223
00:13:57,834 --> 00:13:59,704
Are we supposed to pull?

224
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:01,404
We PUSH, don't we?

225
00:14:01,404 --> 00:14:04,204
Oh, really? Well, on "three".

226
00:14:04,204 --> 00:14:05,004
Okay, bring it!

227
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,704
One, two!

228
00:14:10,674 --> 00:14:13,274
What are those two doing?

229
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:15,114
Hup!

230
00:14:15,684 --> 00:14:18,224
Looks like we were supposed
to pull earlier, huh?

231
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,314
That's right, Yuko-chan.

232
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,294
This one we're doing right!

233
00:14:30,294 --> 00:14:32,564
Look like you're having fun. Hey.

234
00:14:35,434 --> 00:14:37,944
You play around too much and you'll get hurt.

235
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:39,564
No problem!

236
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:41,974
Note: she got spooked, reminded of Sadako, the creepy J-ghost girl.

237
00:14:44,414 --> 00:14:44,974
Huh?

238
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,244
What's the matter, Nagi-chan?

239
00:14:47,244 --> 00:14:49,414
N-Nothing at all!

240
00:14:50,714 --> 00:14:52,814
Okay, here's the next problem...

241
00:15:04,234 --> 00:15:07,204
Torun, are you looking at me, Yutaka?

242
00:15:10,874 --> 00:15:13,064
No doubt about it!

243
00:15:13,874 --> 00:15:15,714
Can I do something for you?!

244
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:16,644
Move.

245
00:15:30,094 --> 00:15:33,294
Well, who can solve this problem?

246
00:15:33,294 --> 00:15:34,384
You certainly are eager.

247
00:15:37,664 --> 00:15:39,204
You mean me?

248
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,764
That's right. Come up front.

249
00:15:51,114 --> 00:15:52,634
Torun!

250
00:15:57,884 --> 00:15:58,914
Yuko-chan!

251
00:15:59,754 --> 00:16:03,194
Try keeping that out instead of tucking it in.

252
00:16:03,194 --> 00:16:04,314
My PE shirt?

253
00:16:12,864 --> 00:16:14,334
She's not wearing any.

254
00:16:14,634 --> 00:16:18,374
Nagi-chan! Look, look! Yuko-chan's not
wearing any! She's not wearing any!

255
00:16:18,374 --> 00:16:19,894
Run, keep your voice down!

256
00:16:21,044 --> 00:16:25,514
And that's what happened.
Toru, YOU'RE wearing PE clothes, right?

257
00:16:25,514 --> 00:16:27,314
You're telling me to tuck it out?

258
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,254
I don't think it'll meet your expectations.

259
00:16:36,324 --> 00:16:37,124
It's just...

260
00:16:37,594 --> 00:16:39,754
A regular dress!

261
00:16:40,664 --> 00:16:42,464
You're so good at packing things away!

262
00:16:43,134 --> 00:16:45,064
She praised me.

263
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,264
Torun...

264
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,104
What's this?

265
00:16:55,314 --> 00:17:02,474
Okay, class will now start. Everyone,
make pairs to do your warm-up exercises.

266
00:17:07,124 --> 00:17:09,184
Torun!

267
00:17:10,354 --> 00:17:12,384
You MUST pair up with me, Yutaka!

268
00:17:18,064 --> 00:17:19,904
Oh. Miporin.

269
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:22,874
Yutaka, you're going to pair up with ME, right?

270
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:25,404
But I have to pair up with Torun-

271
00:17:25,404 --> 00:17:26,964
With ME, right?

272
00:17:28,944 --> 00:17:30,674
WITH ME, RIGHT?

273
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,544
Okay, come this way.

274
00:17:33,544 --> 00:17:35,444
Miporin!

275
00:17:42,254 --> 00:17:45,394
Say, Yuko, do you have any bandages?

276
00:17:45,394 --> 00:17:47,124
What happened? You hurt?

277
00:17:47,124 --> 00:17:51,724
No, I just fell in PE class earlier
and skinned my knee.

278
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:55,394
Oh, that's bad! You gotta hurry and sterilize it.

279
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,104
Let's go to the nurse's office.

280
00:17:57,874 --> 00:18:01,444
For something like this, washing it with water
and putting a bandage on it is plenty.

281
00:18:01,444 --> 00:18:05,014
No way! If it gets infected, it'll get really bad!

282
00:18:05,014 --> 00:18:08,984
Look, it's fine. The next class
is about to start, anyway.

283
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:10,614
C'mon, hurry.

284
00:18:10,854 --> 00:18:12,014
Hey, wait!

285
00:18:13,324 --> 00:18:15,184
I'm telling you, really, I'm fine.

286
00:18:15,654 --> 00:18:17,124
No way!

287
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:21,024
I wonder if something happened.

288
00:18:21,494 --> 00:18:22,724
Excuse...

289
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,604
Yuko-chan!

290
00:18:32,774 --> 00:18:36,764
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I never thought you'd be THERE.

291
00:18:36,914 --> 00:18:41,614
Yeah... I had a fit and fell over. Thank you.

292
00:18:41,614 --> 00:18:42,984
Yuko-chan!

293
00:18:43,084 --> 00:18:46,484
What happen... ed? Huh?

294
00:18:50,154 --> 00:18:53,164
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't see you.

295
00:18:53,164 --> 00:18:58,064
No, no. If anything, it was my honor to be
stepped on by you, Run-chan.

296
00:18:58,464 --> 00:19:03,964
Um, you seem to have taken a shine to Run,
Mr. Sato. Just what is it about her?

297
00:19:05,204 --> 00:19:07,814
Hrm? How she seems able to talk
without reservation...

298
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,344
How truthful she seems...

299
00:19:10,344 --> 00:19:11,334
True enough.

300
00:19:11,444 --> 00:19:14,614
Also, her mild, air-headed sadism.

301
00:19:14,614 --> 00:19:16,414
And her forehead is pretty.

302
00:19:16,414 --> 00:19:19,824
The width of her forehead is the best.
Also, her forehead's...

303
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:22,294
Th-this doctor is...

304
00:19:23,324 --> 00:19:24,724
Sorry for the bother.

305
00:19:24,724 --> 00:19:26,194
Come by anytime.

306
00:19:27,564 --> 00:19:29,534
Class already started, huh?

307
00:19:29,534 --> 00:19:31,434
Sorry for making you late, too.

308
00:19:31,664 --> 00:19:34,704
No. A scrape is nothing to take lightly.

309
00:19:34,704 --> 00:19:37,134
Understood. I'll be careful.

310
00:19:37,404 --> 00:19:40,744
Still, I wonder if that Sato person will be okay...

311
00:19:40,744 --> 00:19:42,104
How so?

312
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:46,844
He was on the floor earlier, right?
I wonder if he's fine all by himself.

313
00:19:47,744 --> 00:19:49,344
It's a little worrisome.

314
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:50,544
That's right!

315
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,854
It's dangerous!

316
00:19:55,154 --> 00:19:57,224
Dangerous how?

317
00:19:57,224 --> 00:19:58,854
He has...

318
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:05,594
S-some strange inclinations.

319
00:20:07,464 --> 00:20:09,034
Oh. That kind of danger.

320
00:20:09,034 --> 00:20:12,104
He complimented me,
said my forehead was pretty!

321
00:20:12,104 --> 00:20:13,944
True, that sounds dangerous.

322
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:15,004
Right?!

323
00:20:20,744 --> 00:20:22,444
Aah, whatever.

324
00:20:27,224 --> 00:20:30,244
Torun, please explain this to me.

325
00:20:30,494 --> 00:20:32,854
Sure. What don't you understand?

326
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:34,294
All of it!

327
00:20:39,164 --> 00:20:41,334
Fine, I'll start from the beginning.

328
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:42,704
Okay!

329
00:20:43,474 --> 00:20:45,704
Toru-san sure is kind, huh?

330
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:46,504
Yeah.

331
00:20:46,504 --> 00:20:50,944
Why don't you understand?
We've gone through this over and over!

332
00:20:50,944 --> 00:20:53,284
I'm sorry! This is like this, right?

333
00:20:53,284 --> 00:20:55,684
No, it's not right! It goes like THIS!

334
00:20:55,684 --> 00:20:55,914
But this goes like this.

335
00:20:55,914 --> 00:20:57,684
If it were me, I would've given up.
But this goes like this.

336
00:20:57,684 --> 00:20:58,384
No, it goes like THIS!

337
00:20:58,384 --> 00:20:59,284
Sure enough.
No, it goes like THIS!

338
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,384
Understand?

339
00:21:05,394 --> 00:21:06,694
Not at all.

340
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:09,054
Yutaka.

341
00:21:09,634 --> 00:21:11,134
Oh, Miporin.

342
00:21:11,134 --> 00:21:14,034
Yutaka, you've been bothering
Toru-san too much recently.

343
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:20,804
Sorry, Toru-san. You don't have to indulge her.
It's really a bother, isn't it?

344
00:21:21,104 --> 00:21:23,074
C'mon, we're going.

345
00:21:38,524 --> 00:21:44,394
That was a big nuisance for Toru-san. If you just
can't understand something, then ask ME first!

346
00:21:53,544 --> 00:21:56,374
Being lonely when someone's not around...

347
00:21:57,744 --> 00:22:00,184
I'm not thinking that! I'm not!

348
00:22:08,254 --> 00:22:10,154
Toru! Toru, wait!

349
00:22:10,754 --> 00:22:10,954
GRIND GRIND

350
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,764
GRIND GRIND
No! No, I said!

351
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,364
GRIND GRIND
I wonder what happened to Toru.

352
00:22:14,364 --> 00:22:15,334
GRIND GRIND
Beats me.

353
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,324
GRIND GRIND
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!

354
00:22:22,534 --> 00:22:24,834
I'm NOT lonely.

355
00:22:41,724 --> 00:22:46,964
Silhouettes, taller than us,
line against the madder tree

356
00:22:46,964 --> 00:22:53,924
The end to an enjoyable day

357
00:22:55,774 --> 00:23:02,944
There's lots, lots of this long story left

358
00:23:02,944 --> 00:23:10,284
But it's about time I have to get home

359
00:23:10,284 --> 00:23:13,584
Okay, see you tomorrow

360
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:17,124
I'll e-mail you

361
00:23:17,494 --> 00:23:24,764
On today's page, everyone had matching smiles

362
00:23:24,764 --> 00:23:28,064
Okay, see you tomorrow

363
00:23:28,434 --> 00:23:31,734
Thanks for everything

364
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:40,614
I'm glad we could be together again today

365
00:23:40,614 --> 00:23:47,784
La-la-laa, humming to our hearts and the wind

366
00:23:47,784 --> 00:23:54,354
At the next corner, a bye-bye
while looking over our shoulders

367
00:23:55,864 --> 00:23:57,864
yup!

368
00:23:57,864 --> 00:24:00,934
And so! I, Yutaka, and Miporin
played a prominent role this time!

369
00:24:00,934 --> 00:24:02,634
In any case, it's already summer!

370
00:24:02,634 --> 00:24:05,244
What, already? Isn't that a bit fast?

371
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:10,274
Yes, well, there are reasons for it. Like a
swimsuit episode or a hot springs episode.

372
00:24:10,274 --> 00:24:12,384
No, I don't think there'll be any hot springs.

373
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:16,314
But before anyone changes into a bathing suit,
there will be great, difficult problem...

374
00:24:16,484 --> 00:24:19,084
Next
Episode!
Next time on A-Channel: "Kilogram"

375
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,424
A diet, huh?

376
00:24:20,424 --> 00:24:24,014
I, Yutaka, have a nice body,
so that word is foreign to me!
