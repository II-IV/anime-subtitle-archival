00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,130
Huh?

182
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,840
Taiga is my dearest best friend!

183
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,640
Please bestow happiness upon her!

184
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,270
Wait, Kushieda. Are you saying you're—?

185
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,430
Happiness?

186
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,360
So that's how it was.

187
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,900
You must be happy!

188
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,110
Kitamura? What're you doing up there?

189
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,700
I was wondering why you were together so often,

190
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,410
but now that I think about it, you two fit together so well!

191
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,410
Aisaka! Get yourself together!

192
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,500
You! Stop laughing!

193
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,750
Takasu-kun.

194
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:35,880
If you make Taiga cry... I won't forgive you.

195
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,930
Kushi... eda...

196
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,890
I'm sorry.

197
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:56,650
Minorin misunderstood everything because I was intruding at your house.

198
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,230
No, that's—

199
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,320
Your place was...

200
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,610
really cozy.

201
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:10,080
You see, I struggled so much with my parents that when I said I wanted to leave,

202
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,830
they simply gave me that apartment.

203
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,500
I knew they were those kind of parents, but...

204
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,630
The cookies were salty, weren't they?

205
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,800
I was frustrated when I found them in pieces, so I ate some.

206
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,170
They were horrible!

207
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,180
Yet you ate all of them.

208
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,800
You even lied about their taste.

209
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,350
Even as a mongrel, your fur will shed if you keep being so nice to everyone.

210
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,020
Mind your own business.

211
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:38,730
Hey, do you also get troubled while thinking about Minori?

212
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,440
Yeah, I do.

213
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,690
Yeah, I guess you would...

214
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,110
Aisaka?

215
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,580
Why doesn't anyone understand us?

216
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:57,370
Even when we're so troubled, why doesn't anyone support us?

217
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,840
In truth, everyone...

218
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,840
Everyone's... Everyone's... Everyone's...

219
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,510
<i>Pissing me off!</i>

220
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:07,880
<i>Pissing me off!</i>

221
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,180
<i>Pissing me off!</i>

222
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,050
<i>Pissing me off!</i>

223
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,520
Pissing me off!

224
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,800
Who's the Palmtop Tiger?!

225
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,520
I'm not okay with being that at all!

226
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,900
Minorin, you idiot!

227
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,020
Kitamura-kun, you idiot!

228
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,770
Why won't you listen to me?!

229
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,610
Even mom, even dad, no one...

230
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,910
Understands me...

231
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,200
I'll help out.

232
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,420
Do you have a problem with me being small?!

233
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,420
Stop calling me a delinquent just because of my appearance!

234
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,130
Do you have a problem with us being together in front of everyone?!

235
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,960
I'm sorry for having evil-looking eyes!

236
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,140
Hey, are you okay?

237
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,220
Hey, Ryuuji, isn't this pole tilted now?

238
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,600
Huh? That's not poss—

239
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,460
It <i>is</i>  tilted!

240
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,270
See?!

241
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,150
Yes!

242
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,270
We won, we won!

243
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,360
All right, I've decided!

244
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,950
Tomorrow, I will confess to Kitamura-kun.

245
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,700
It'll all be over then.

246
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,820
Over?

247
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,160
Your services as a dog will be over.

248
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,410
As of tomorrow, we're just classmates who live close to each other.

249
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,120
And that's all there is to it.

250
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,260
Bye bye, Takasu-kun.

251
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,590
Yeah...

252
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,020
Ryuu-chan...

253
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,570
Aren't we having breakfast really early today?

254
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,690
Yacchan likes canned mackerel, but...

255
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,360
Is Taiga-chan still sleeping?

256
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,570
I don't know.

257
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,240
Did you have a fight?

258
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,410
No, we didn't.

259
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,540
I'm so bored.

260
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,340
Right?

261
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,460
Yes.

262
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,100
H-Hey.

263
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,610
Did she...?

264
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:39,790
T-Takasu, we're sorry.

265
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,660
We spread all those weird rumors...

266
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,380
Aisaka-san got mad at us.

267
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,420
Huh?

268
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,830
"There's nothing between me and Ryuuji."

269
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,000
Saying you're not a delinquent, making a huge mess.

270
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,380
She really is scary, the Palmtop Tiger.

271
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,050
But I said that Takasu isn't as scary as he looks, right?

272
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,640
What, when did you?

273
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,390
More importantly, shouldn't we clean this up real fast?

274
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,270
Kushieda.

275
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,820
Takasu-kun, I'm sorry.

276
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,600
A-About what?

277
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,070
You see, Taiga was saying...

278
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,030
"I'm absolutely not going out with Takasu-kun."

279
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,660
"So this is all a misunderstanding."

280
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,990
She especially wanted me to be aware of this...

281
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:24,300
And she had this kind of desperate, serious look about her.

282
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,300
But does that mean she...

283
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,250
Does that mean she—

284
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,790
Do you know, Takasu-kun?

285
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,050
Takasu-kun?

286
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,880
<i>What does she think she's doing?</i>

287
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,100
<i>Weren't you going to confess to Kitamura today?!</i>

288
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,850
<i>This isn't the time to be worrying about me!</i>

289
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,480
As of tomorrow, we're just classmates who live close to each other.

290
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,940
And that's all there is to it.

291
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,450
<i>"And that's all there is to it"?</i>

292
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,280
Kitamura-kun!

293
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,450
Huh?!

294
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,160
I... Kitamura-kun...

295
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,120
Kitamura-kun... I....

296
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,380
Um, uh... I, uh... That is...

297
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,420
<i>Why are you doing it right after arriving at school?</i>

298
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,010
<i>If things don't turn out well, this will be one hell of a bad day, you know.</i>

299
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,050
Um, uh...

300
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,270
Wait up.

301
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:26,140
I think I get how this conversation will spell out.

302
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,610
But before that, I would like to verify something.

303
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,770
Aren't you dating Takasu-kun?

304
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,360
That's just Minorin misunderstanding things!

305
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,360
There's nothing between us!

306
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,780
So you don't like him?

307
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,620
It's not like that!

308
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,250
Our houses just happen to be close to each other.

309
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,580
It has nothing to do with liking him or not.

310
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,170
Then, do you dislike him?

311
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,640
I don't dislike him.

312
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,930
But it's not about that!

313
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:05,350
Um, you see, Takasu-kun is...

314
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,060
Yes, fried rice!

315
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,270
Ryuuji made me delicious fried rice!

316
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,320
He cheered me up...

317
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,730
He even lied to make me feel better...

318
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,120
Being there for me...

319
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,700
Because Ryuuji was there, because he was supporting me...!

320
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:29,670
Because of that, I'm now capable of standing here like this!

321
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,960
I'm in love with you, Kitamura-kun!

322
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,630
<i>Aisaka, you're amazing.</i>

323
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,560
I see.

324
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:47,190
It's okay, I think your feelings were properly relayed.

325
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,640
Kitamura-kun...?

326
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,230
Do you recall one year ago?

327
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,440
Yeah.

328
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,110
Unlike that time, you now have this

329
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,610
funny-looking face!

330
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,200
Funny face?

331
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,210
Yeah, when you're around Takasu, you have this funny-looking face.

332
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,660
Takasu's a great guy.

333
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:15,630
And you, thinking of him like you did earlier,

334
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,180
makes you a wonderful girl.

335
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,470
Like I did earlier...?

336
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,640
What did I say?

337
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,930
But I'm relieved you're on such good terms with Takasu.

338
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,640
W-W-Wait up!

339
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,560
Ryuuji doesn't have anything to do-

340
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,100
My face was looking funny?

341
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,230
My feet, what about my feet? Wait, what am I saying?

342
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,650
Was I able to tell you I love you?

343
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,030
It's going to be okay, Aisaka.

344
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,360
It's okay.

345
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,240
What's going to be okay?!

346
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,120
You haven't understood what I was saying!

347
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,210
It'll be okay, from now on, I'm sure we'll be great friends.

348
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,870
Like I'm saying, not friends, I was confess—

349
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,170
Friends...?

350
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,500
Yes, friends.

351
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,760
Oops, we'll be late for homeroom.

352
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,470
Better hurry up, Aisaka!

353
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,690
I thought you were going to start crying.

354
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:24,360
Y-You! D-Did you see all of it?

355
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,490
I did, but I didn't mean to...

356
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,750
"Didn't mean to"? You—!

357
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,280
But what're you going to do?

358
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,710
I'm going home.

359
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,210
I see.

360
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,460
I'll make you food.

361
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,460
You haven't had breakfast, have you?

362
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,430
And did you even eat last night?

363
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,420
I'm sure you went to the convenie—

364
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,510
Stop it!

365
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:48,850
Why? If you do that again, people will start misunderstanding again.

366
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,430
I've told you you don't have to do this anymore!

367
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,230
I don't get it either.

368
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,190
But I can't leave you alone!

369
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,440
I'm telling you it's enough already!

370
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,940
You're no longer my dog!

371
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,830
I see.

372
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,320
Yes, I am not a dog.

373
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,450
I'm a dragon.

374
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:15,870
Thus, I'm able to be by your side!

375
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,540
Ais-

376
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,420
Taiga!

377
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,460
"Taiga"?

378
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,010
Since the ancient times, the dragon has been the only beast that could equally stand with a tiger.

379
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,010
I'll become a dragon.

380
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,850
And thus, as a dragon, I'll be able to be at your side, tiger.

381
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,980
There's a limit to how impudent you can be!

382
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,940
Oww...

383
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,610
Know your place already!

384
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,690
Why, you...

385
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:47,990
Hey!

386
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,740
Hurry up, I'm hungry, you know.

387
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,610
Huh?

388
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,200
And we're going to make a new plan.

389
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,410
I'm not giving up on Kitamura-kun just from that.

390
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,710
Does that mean...?

391
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,330
It doesn't matter whether you're a dog or a dragon...

392
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:06,420
Since you said you'd be at my side, you better work hard, Ryuuji.

393
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,050
Did I decide on this too quickly...?

394
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,140
Come on already!

395
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,680
Yeah, yeah.

396
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,770
<i>He said, "Taiga."</i>

397
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:35,040

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,580
