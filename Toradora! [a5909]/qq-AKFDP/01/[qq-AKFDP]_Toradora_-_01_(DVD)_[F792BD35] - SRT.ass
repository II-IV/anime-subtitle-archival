00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,720
...hell..

181
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,730
...are...

182
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:51,930
...you...

183
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,810
...doing?!

184
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,560
Forget about it.

185
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,070
Forget about...?

186
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,900
Oh, that le—

187
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,530
—tter...

188
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:07,450
I can no longer live on now that you've found out about that. I have to die!

189
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,240
Then don't try to kill me!

190
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,080
I don't want to die, so I've got to kill you!

191
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,830
Or... you could forget all about it!

192
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,210
That's impossible!

193
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:25,380
It'll be okay, I'll just hit you on the head with this. Even if I can't kill you, I can send your memories flying away.

194
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,550
Don't send them flying!

195
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,640
Listen, that letter—

196
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,260
Shut up.

197
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,010
What...?

198
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,310
<i>Shut up, shut up!</i>

199
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,310
You saw it, didn't you?! You read it, didn't you?!

200
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,150
I'm trying to tell you, I didn't-

201
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,810
No, that won't do.

202
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:44,360
So you have to forget all about that l-l-love letter!

203
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,780
<i>It was empty!</i>

204
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,370
Em...pty...?

205
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,080
Yes. There was nothing inside.

206
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,500
You're lucky you didn't turn it over to Kitamura.

207
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,920
So let's just leave this failure be and—

208
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,220
H-Hey!

209
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,270
Just how hungry are you?

210
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,320
I got tired of the convenience store.

211
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,280
Convenience store? What, don't your parents fe—

212
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:30,200
Everyone has their family issues, I guess.

213
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,990
Here.

214
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,670
If you had just quietly handed over the bag earlier, things wouldn't have ended up like this.

215
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,210
How do you intend to make up for it?!

216
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,630
It's still stuck to your face.

217
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:52,350
Hearing that from a guy who was born only to add the scent of garlic to the oil used in this fried rice...

218
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,810
Now listen here...

219
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,280
How is a love letter embarrassing?

220
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,240
You see, that's not even close to being embarrassing. Just wait.

221
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,490
Behold!

222
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,250
What's all this?

223
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,000
Do you know what that is? You don't, do you?

224
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,880
That's a list of songs I would use if I were to put on a concert for the girl I like.

225
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,220
That's a poem I wrote for her without realizing it.

226
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,350
MDs to play while I'm on a car trip with her.

227
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,680
I don't have a license, of course.

228
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,810
I have plans laid out for all seasons of the year.

229
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,440
Disgusting, isn't it?

230
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,980
Since I don't have the guts to confess to her, I just have to imagine like this.

231
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,360
It's horribly miserable, but I don't think of it as embarrassing!

232
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,990
You've got to have faith in yourself!

233
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:53,370
You've gone beyond imagining and went and took action!

234
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,120
You've got to think about the future, passionately, in high spirits!

235
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,290
"I present this to thee, Kushieda Minori."

236
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,120
Yes, just like Kushieda Minori!

237
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,460
Wha—!

238
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,040
So you like Minori?

239
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,130
How impudent.

240
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,380
Learn your place.

241
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,430
Shut up! You're not one to talk!

242
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,720
What's with you?! You said you'd forget!

243
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,430
Shut up! Goose, goosebumps!

244
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,440
I'm sorry, Inko-chan. Did we wake you?

245
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,980
What are you showing me?! How disgusting!

246
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,570
What are you saying about my precious family?!

247
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,240
I-I-I-I—

248
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,450
That's it! Are you going to present yourself to the visitor, Inko-chan?

249
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,320
Go ahead and say your name!

250
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,740
Inpo!

251
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,290
Inpo!

252
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:48,210
No, you see, Inko-chan isn't feeling well today...

253
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,130
Whoa, it's already this late!

254
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:57,550
E-Either way, we're birds of the same feather! I won't tell anyone about the letter! Can't you be okay with that?

255
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,220
No.

256
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,730
Why?! No wait, you've already gotten a meal, just leave!

257
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,690
Rather, please leave? My wacky mom is about to come home!

258
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,980
<i>No fucking way!</i>

259
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,520
<i>No fucking way!</i>

260
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,320
<i>No fucking way!</i>

261
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,030
I can't trust you.

262
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,240
And besides...

263
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:19,240
How are love letters? They're not fashionable anymore, are they?

264
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,910
Why are you fidgeting now?!

265
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:27,040
I'll give you advice on romantic relationships any time, but it's already late, so how about tomorrow...?

266
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,090
Really? You'll help me?

267
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,550
I will. I will I will I will! I'll do anything!

268
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:40,560
Anything, right? You'll obey me like a dog? You'll do anything to the extreme?

269
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,930
Yes, I will. I swear!

270
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:46,350
So, let's just end it at that, okay? Okay?

271
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,820
How did she get in through the window?

272
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,160
Well then.

273
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,610
I'll walk you home.

274
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,530
No, it's okay. It's close, and I've got this wooden sword.

275
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,790
Wait, that's just dangerous.

276
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,040
Hey, that hole...

277
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:10,250
Oh, that? I can just cover it up with some paper.

278
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:11,920
Here.

279
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,800
You can use this.

280
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:18,390
If it ends up costing money, I'll pay you later.

281
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,220
See you, Ryuuji.

282
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,720
Yeah.

283
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:28,150
Wait, did she just call me by my first name?

284
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,160
Yes, this is the Takasu residenc—

285
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,580
<i>Get the hell over here! You're—</i>

286
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:56,630
Yes?

287
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,510
You hung up, didn't you?

288
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,760
Come over where?

289
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,470
Huh?

290
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,850
The veranda, why?

291
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,480
<i>How?</i>

292
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,360
You said you'd do anything, just like a dog, right?

293
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,530
Wait, that was about yesterday's thing about Kitamura—

294
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:23,950
If you don't come, you know what will happen, don't you? I can show you what will happen if you want me to...

295
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,120
Um, you see...

296
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:31,420
Wait ten more minutes! The seasoned rice will be done in ten more minutes!

297
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,170
Three?

298
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,300
You want some too?

299
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,990
Whoa.

300
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,290
Excuse me?

301
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,710
Huh?

302
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,540
It's open?

303
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,130
What the hell is this smell?!

304
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,340
Aisaka-san, I'm coming in.

305
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,350
What an amazing smell.

306
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,190
<i>Aisaka!</i>

307
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,940
Aisaka. Aisaka! <i>Aisaka!</i>

308
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,200
Your kitchen!

309
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,320
Allow me to—!

310
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,910
Please, allow me to clean your kitchen!

311
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:55,580
What, sleeping again?

312
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,130
She looks handcrafted...

313
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,090
The sleeping Aisaka really looked like a doll.

314
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:11,560
The house had no trace of anyone really living there. It looked like it was part of someone's doll house.

315
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,770
But it was too large to be someone's doll house.

316
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,110
It'll take fifteen minutes, I guess.

317
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,450
Alright!

318
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,050
What's... this...?

319
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,600
Hey.

320
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,560
I'm still at it, but it's a lot cleaner now, isn't it?

321
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,690
It was horrid!

322
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,650
The water clogged up in the sink was rotten.

323
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:03,190
The drainage was awfully moldy and all the waste was like hell spawn.

324
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,610
And the room was full of dust...

325
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,790
Trespassing. Forced cleaning. You didn't go around marking the place, did you, dog?!

326
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,950
<i>Dog?</i>

327
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:17,540
I'll have to apologize to the other dogs. You're a mongrel of a dog.

328
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,790
Mon-grel.

329
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:22,630
What an ungrateful bitch, when other people have—!

330
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,430
Hey, where's your table prayer?

331
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:39,900
Dear god of rice and producers of this product, I thank you for this meal!

332
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,320
Oh you...

333
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,650
Hey, your nose stopped dripping.

334
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:50,070
Yeah, since the room's all clean...

335
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,240
What did you just say?

336
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,080
<i>Shut up!</i>

337
00:21:55,060 --> 00:22:05,090
Next Episode Preview: Ryuuji and Taiga

338
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,910
Disoriented agreement.

339
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:57,660
Surfacing misunderstandings.

340
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,080
The power of genes.

341
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,750
Taiga, you...

342
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,630
You're one hell of a klutz.

343
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,340
Shut up and rot.
