03:04 Taiga and Yasuko here might sound a bit awkward, but Taiga is sulking and replying to Yasuko thus. Her no longer “having anything” when Yasuko asks if something happened is because she’s sulking over “losing” Ryuuji to Ami.

03:!4 Red rice, or osekihan, is a dish used for celebrating. See above line where Ryuuji apparently should celebrate getting it on with Ami. [This thing here kinda explains it](https://web.archive.org/web/20090422154618/http://www.justhungry.com/2006/03/japanese_basics.html) since ikipedia sucks for this.

05:54 Yuri’s ranting to herself about “koi no aventure” or “season of love” as I put it. Note that to the japanese, aventure is a type of flashy clothing style where you show as much skin as possible. So “koi no aventure” might just be that she’s wanting to be flashy in love and go all out. Thus “season of love” fit.

06:21 The blackboard here has a line cut off. In order to give some freedom and yet restrict the testosterone levels in boys, girls have to wear one-piece swimsuits. I was a bit saddened by this since the promo magazine pictures for this episode has Ami in a hot bikini.

10:20 [Isoflavone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoflavone). I can’t find anywhere that says this makes your breasts bigger. Is Ryuuji tricking Yasuko into believing this since it helps prevent breast cancer? I could go on this trail of thought, but in the novels Yasuko sees this on TV and makes Ryuuji make it for her. When I remembered this my hopes of Ryuuji being a troll for once were crushed.

10:54 “That was horrible, gimme more!” If you’ve dug around at Japanese catchphrase-creating commercials, you might have heard of Aojiru. This commercial promotes vegetable juices that… taste horrible. Like, real horrible. Taiga parodies it with “mazui mou hitotsubu”, while the original is “mazui mou ippai”. She wants on more beans, while the guy in the video wants another glass. [Watch this old guy drink it on YouTube](https://web.archive.org/web/20090422154618/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM5w5ObeAmo).

14:22 “When I become a bride, I will take these with pride!” To get this, first I’ll explain the cultural background. When you become a bride in the glorious Nippon, you take something with you from home. Taiga decides that she wants the breast pads Ryuuji wants for her, and thus announces this. I could have put “When I’m wed,  I will take this with me from home.” But Taiga’s making a rhyme here: “oyome no iku toki wa, kanarazu motteiku wa”. So I made it rhyme in english too.

16:40 FAKE BREAST SPECIAL FORCE. Minorin is not amused. [I noted on this in episode 6](https://web.archive.org/web/20090422154618/http://blog.ilif.in/2008/11/09/toradora-episode-6-translation-notes/).
