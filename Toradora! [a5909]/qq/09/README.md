03:04 Yasuko has to stir the rice bran because of keeping whatever is stored in it in proper shape. This technique is called nukazuke, [read more about it on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nukazuke). Revision 2 of this note, as Cat_Megex figured it out.

04:10 I… Yeah. I spent lots of time figuring what the fuck this was, and I found it: this is a famous dance from the boyband-esque dance-heavy group [ZOO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo_(band)), whose members later founded [EXILE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile_(Japanese_band)). They’ve done both the swirly dance thing and the hands thing they scare off Ami with. [Have a look at the on YouTube](https://web.archive.org/web/20090519180629/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufmy0KxvqWE). It should be noted though, that Minorin decides she referenced [Asura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asura_(Buddhism)) and not ZOO for the last thing in the novels.

04:26 Starting this episode, Minorin’s stuck the nickname A-min on Ami. I’m not sure whether we missed this in previous episodes or not, as I found the Japanese equivalent in volume 3 of the novels too - but at least you know now.

05:06 “There’s a plum in this that makes it super plum!” I feel like I have to explain this: Minorin says something like “ume haitte, chou umeee”. She’s making a horrible pun here, where “ume” is plum, and “umee” is a casual and masculine way of describing something as tasting good. I employed the forces of one of our british QCers for this line, who came up with this phrase, which apparently only makes sense to scone munching faggots like himself. Minorin thinks the plum in the onigiri makes it super good, or super plum, as a fine lad like Kaze would say.

05:25 As Minorin changes her nickname for Ami, so does Taiga. Earlier in the episode she did the whole “stupid chihuahua” (baka chiwawa) thing - here she changes it to “stupid chi’” (bakachi) - so we did accordingly.

06:05 Taiga’s meanness towards Minori’s extreme fear for the occult is fun. I’m not going to note on how much different superstitions the Japanese have from the west, as I’m not too familiar with it, but take note of how Minorin feels she’s been “called” - i.e. the “ghost” now has “attached” itself to her by her hearing it’s voice.

06:48 They really don’t use “white knight” here - it just says “knight”. But since Ryuuji is going to be her white knight, we put white knight.

08:35 The seaweed fun begins - if you look at seaweed from some absurd angle, it apparently looks like human hair. Taiga tries to calm Minorin down but her mind already has started leaping to conclusions and the more Taiga feeds her, the more frightened she gets.

11:12 BOOM! Okay, this people were bugging me about even as episode 9 aired - how I would interpret this. I’ll elaborate on this, because this is more detailed in the novels than in the anime. First of all, Taiga has seen Ami naked, in the shower/bath. Taiga notes on how Ami’s left breast is large, and her right breast is large, and then moves her hands down to her crotch, and utters the same thing about her crotch too. Note, not her stomach, but her crotch. Yes, Ami doesn’t shave downstairs and her bush apparently is huge on the same level as her breasts.

11:55 Minorin and the seaweed superstition is back. Watch how her mind races as she draws the conclusion to the curse of the sea otter that gets stuck in seaweed. I don’t know the cultural reference here either, sadly - but it seems to me that Minorin will get anything out of the slightest scary thing.

13:03 Minorin’s calling Kitamura a heaven-sent child, or moushigo (申し子) as it is in Japanese. This refers to some kind of perfect child sent to you as an answer to your Shinto prayers, of course in reference to how much of a “perfect” guy in all aspects Kitamura is. Or is he?

14:30 GATSUN (impact) + itadakimasu = Minorin shenanigans. She has accepted the food with IMPACT and is loving it.

15:50 A simple phrase from Ryuuji can hold so much meaning that is being omitted. “You’re just really complicated” - this line is different in the novels. He’s in the novels talking about how she’s balancing on a fine line between her two sides at all times, and how it strikes him again and again how much of a weird girl she is. She’s outwards a beauty, but in truth a really malicious woman. It is though during this trail of thought that he changes his opinion of her - you can see his face expression change in the anime at this point. He concludes with that, all things aside, she is a perfectly normal sixteen-seventeen year old teenager girl, who’s just a bit complicated for her own good. Further in the novels, Ami’s all tilting her head and being enthralled by how Ryuuji is scanning her, and even starts to have this childish smile as if receiving a candy for the first time. And Ryuuji decides her really likes this part of her.

16:54 The green tea flavored and azuki flavored ice cream things. [Azuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azuki_bean) some red bean thing that is used in tons of eastern cuisines, and it is rather sweet - although I doubt it in ice cream. [Green tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_tea#Japanese_green_teas) ice cream sounds tasty, yet I’m not sure how it would taste. Ryuuji’s having a Matcha green tea flavored ice cream thing.
