01:46 Kitamura goes all weird here so I made him Yoda. Worry do not, my padawans, the seaweed with you be.

03:47 You probably are used to this by now, but Minorin’s again going all wacky with her voice and referencing <something>, probably casual variety shows with cooking.

05:08 I thought Taiga was the one to twist her tongue? “Kyusheda” -> “Takyasu-kyun”, so cute. He mispronounces her name, so she does it right back at him.

05:52 Komachi Angel is a B’z song, from the single [Taiyou no Komachi Angel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiy%C5%8D_no_Komachi_Angel). Why Minorin says it, I do not know. It might just be the song lyrics? You ask me why this is relevant, and I’ll ask you back. Both 2ch and Nico are as confused as me, so just watch it live here if you want.

09:15 Minorin gets reminded of the black and rather lively thing here, good thing her mind wanders back to the yaoi pairing at hand?

17:53 The “Manjuu Kowai” method refers to a troll from the 17th century’s [Rakugo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiy%C5%8D_no_Komachi_Angel) play by the same name. Read a translation [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20090422062830/http://ttuacjp.at.infoseek.co.jp/manjukowai.html). Summary for the lazy:
The play depics a bunch of people talking about what they are scared of, except one guy, who doesn’t say a word. Everyone gets interested in what he is scared of, and he finally claims that he gets sick of manjuus and that he is scared of them. They decide to pull a prank on him by buying all kinds of manjuu and stuffing them around him in his room. He is of course not scared of them, and munches down on them and finally claims he now is scared of a cup of tea… further dragging on the troll!
Minorin is obviously a master troll.

20:46 A [Tsuchinoko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsuchinoko) is a legendary snake from Japan said to exist, but neve confirmed to be in existance. It is about as famous as the Loch Ness monster, I guess?
