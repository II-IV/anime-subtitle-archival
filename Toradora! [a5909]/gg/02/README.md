Toradora episode 2 has proven that J.C.Staff are able to properly channel the works of Yuyuko Takemiya. Or well, somewhat, since they heavily rush through the original content. But, we didn’t want to spam the episode with text, so here’s me trying to explain some of the more peculiar things you’ll find in the episode:

First of all, Inko-chan. In the first episode, we did not really get its penis joke, where it goes “inpo” instead of “chinpo”, which was kinda supposed to be penis. That Inko-chan mis-pronounces to makes jokes is now apparent, which showed up in episode 2 too. This time, the bird goes “Timoten”, not “Timotei”, and if you’re watched [Lucky Star](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=7222), you probably are getting this joke. If not, there isn’t much to get about it, other than it becoming a huge western meme: [have som YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5KH9Z383hE).

Starting at around 03:29, there is an exchange of comments where Minori starts to misunderstand what’s going on since Taiga and Ryuuji are walking to school together. If we were to be literal here, we would have having Minori using very awkward phrases. We landed on the “companioned, commuting relationship”, where she really is saying “having a let’s-do-a-two-shot-photograph kind commuting relationship”. As Taiga points out, Minori is being weird, since “two-shot” is used for couples who are close enough to take their picture together, and also for scenes in movies where a male and female character are alone. She continues on with trying to figure the word, finally saying “Egads”. She has already been using outdated phrases, and serves us a what I could have translated as “Oi, nutter” or “I’m endlessly confused and surprised”. “Egads” felt right to her character, so we went with it. Finally, she figures what she thinks it might be: “avec”. Yeah, french, and not “two-shot” either. Having already used “companioned”, we needed a middle-ground here too: “avec” is “together”; and we thus got “togethered”.

Kitamura is being called Maruo by his classmates. This is because he really looks like Suneo Maruo from [Chibi Maruko-chan](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=479), a typical nice-guy class leader type of person. You can hear Kihara (orange-haired girl) be all giddy about it, even when Kitamura wants them to stop calling him it. I think Yuyuko really likes Maruko-chan.

Minorin is tossing the basketball with 8 fingers, no thumbs, for some odd reason. While researching this I came over the character Satonaka Satoru from the anime and manga [Dokaben](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1308). He has this pitch he does where he doesn’t use his thumb… and this in baseball. Minoris obsession with baseball blends in here as she’s trying to emulate the Satoru-ball, as it is called, with a basketball. And failed at it, too.

Ryuuji’s mom, Yasuko, is a wacky kind of person, Ryuuji even it stated in the first episode. I expected more antics from her with how she changes how she speaks, but for now, she’s finally begun referring to herself as “Yacchan”. She cuts of 1/3 of her name and adds a “cchan” to it, in order to appeal even cuter. In coming episodes, we might see her do [Shoko-tan](https://web.archive.org/web/20081012051050/http://blog.excite.co.jp/shokotan/) impressions, like in the novels.
