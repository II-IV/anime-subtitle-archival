03:51 Taiga, being the embarassed little things she is, goes out with a “OHHA~” here. History time; OHHA~ was the catchphrase of the show おはスタ (OHASUTA or Morning Star if you will), as you can see [here on YouTube](https://web.archive.org/web/20081027015859/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXTf0rkuEe0). Later, Shingo Katori from the boyband group SMAP was allowed to use it and tried to make it his catchphrase aswell. The reason for this being old is.. well, it IS old, and so outdated.

04:51 Maruo: See [episode 2 notes](https://web.archive.org/web/20081027015859/http://blog.ilif.in/2008/10/10/toradora-episode-2-translation-notes/). Taiga’s doing a funny on them calling him Maruo, which is like “ball-y”, cause of his round head. The japanese for rolling something up is “marumeru”, which has the “maru” of “maruo”. She’s being funny, see? Ha.

07:16 No, I’m not TLing this. Shut up, Haruta. Yuri-chan, stop being mean to the viewers by making Haruta speak.

08:21 Excitement festival. YES, she’s saying wakiwaki carnival, and even [NicoNico agrees it is weird](https://web.archive.org/web/20081027015859/http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm5022218).

08:50 Rub a dub dub… koda tells me this is from Simpsons. I lolled and this was originally “itadakimasu”x2, a honorable table prayer before chugging edible things down your throat. Rubber ducky psyduck koda.

09:02 Minorin is eating her tori karaage, which is fried chicken, and going TORII KARAA. This is a sort of tie-in to the next TL note, so read on…

09:43 Minorin likes brown bento boxes, because the “brown” she’s referring to is food that has been fried like say, tempura, fried chicken and so on. She’s so happy about the color she salutes the food earlier by announcing its color, BIRD COLOR, as a pun on “tori karaage” by removing the “ge” in “karaa”, which reads as カラー, which - you guessed it - means color.

11:30 48 housework styles? That’s some crazy shit there, Ryuuji. I’m not sure whether this is even worth a note, but he’s naming it after a billion different “buster” types of attacks. Like DIVINE BUSTER from Nanoha of Nanoha fame.

13:03 Do you see it? Next to SUDOH-BUCKS is.. Furukawa Bread! This is the famous CLANNAD pastry of doom from Nagisa’s mom, making a cameo in Toradora.

13:32 Sure is lots of carnivals today, Taiga.

14:47 Onigiri is rice balls that are so common in anime that I should not need to note on it. Check out [Wikipedia for more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onigiri) on this lovely dish which is simply and yet somehow so tasty.

17:03 Minorin appears! TL notes follow! Ryuuji is here using a slang phrase, “seishinteki burakura”. This is a rather fun word since it means “mental browser crash”. His mind crashed, so his mind is blown.

17:07 This is either a Lucky Star reference or a direct reference to the pastry chain Cake Viking. Konata uses the same phrase in some anime episode and I can’t be arsed to find out where. Have fun looking.

17:24 Minorin has tons of pictures and poses with them as if she was from Yu-Gi-Oh, but isn’t saying Yu-Gi-Oh, rather just “card play”. Episode one had Yu-Gi-Oh shit too, I hope this stops appearing…

21:52 Inko-chan joke, finally. Can’t have an episode without. This time the “ko” is removed from its name again, making up an “injanai”. It’s not really a pun or anything, it’s just somehow very lol since the bird speaks normally out of nowhere.
