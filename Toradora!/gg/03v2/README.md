Where to begin. This episode is again filled with popular culture references, old ones and new. None other than our lovely referencebot Minorin will be providing me with this large amount of notes for this episode.

00:31 We start off with the baseball madness from Minori. She’s the captain for the girls’ softball team, so no wonder she’s here shouting “ippatsu kamashitare” - ippatsu being slang for a homerun, and the whole chant together is pretty much something you’d sing during a baseball. And did you know this shit makes good rock music? [Have some YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9vUBt0kgqc).

00:55 Minori-time. Yeah, she’s not saying this, but this flows way better than having her state the obvious. And she really is putting it in a way that call for MINORI-TIME.

04:38 Cellphone decoration. This is so popular in Japan that it’s creepy, and the shit is more bling than any wigger medallion collection out there. No wonder she can earn money from it. What I want to point out there is the Swarovski stones, that you can by from stores [like this](https://web.archive.org/web/20081020093234/http://www.swaroshop.com/) one. Not sure how common they are outside of Japan, so now you know. Go bling your phones.

07:08 Shabu-shabu is a hot-pot kind of dish with thin slices of meat and vegetables, similar to sukiyaki, where you dip your food in sauces. Shabu-shabu is the savory version, while sukiyaki has a more sweet taste. [Read up on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabu-shabu).

07:25 Okay, first reference to popular culture. What Minorin is referencing here is the ‘96 show Silverwolf Horror Files (銀狼怪奇ファイル, ginrou kaiki file), she’s changed it to be Mysterious Files of Labour (勤労怪奇ファイル, kinrou kaiki file). The original is some horror show with a kid that almost gets killed while accidentally getting involved in a murder case, and from the shock gains another personality called Silverwolf (Ginrou) with an IQ of 220 and some shit. This split personality is some evil bastard or something too, thus the title.

09:35 Hi, Inko-chan. We know you did penis and timotei already, and this time we get POOP? The bird is doing 2/3 of the correct spelling of it’s name, but says an U instead of I, and comes out as UNKO, POOP. Yeah, thanks Unko-chan.

11:22 If you can read katakana, you can see that this sausage or what it is reads “Gyoniku”. Yet, Minorin says Gyonisa. ク looks like サ if you write crudely, so this is either a flop-up by the seiyuu or just someone writing it wrong in the script. Even Taiga and Ryuuji notice it. Gyoniku is fish meat by the way, so it sure has tons of fish oil.

18:38 Baseball-chatter is back. “piccha ga bibitteru” is literally that the pitcher’s scared. This is yet another baseball chant like the one above, but more commonly used by kids when playing softball. I remember seeing penalties being handed out from doing this chant, stop being such a rascal, Minorin.

20:13 Somewhy, you ask? Yeah, we’ve messed up the language here, since that’s exactly what Minorin is doing. On blogs, messageboards and the likes, you can see people say “nankuru naisa”, as a slang for the actual phrase; “nantoka naru sa” (it’ll work out, somehow). She’s saying “nantoka daijboubu sa”, first mixing in “daijoubu” into “nantoka naru sa”, creating “nantoka daijoubu sa” (it’ll be okay, somehow), and then converting it to “nankuru daisa”. Trying to convert the messing with the language she is doing, we ended up with, “Oh, it’ll be okay somewhy!”, messing up the language some on our own.

20:41 Second and last popular culture reference. “FIGHT! IPPATSU!” Or as we put it, “FIGHT! Chug one!” This is a reference to the really popular commercials for the Ripobitan D energy drink. [Have some YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AeGof3Kuk).
