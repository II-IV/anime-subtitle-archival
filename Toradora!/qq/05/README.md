# Translation Notes

00:00 Golden Week is a long-ass holiday in Japan. Read up on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Week_(Japan)) as I can’t be arsed to explain it in detail.

01:24 Can Vi! doesn’t really exist, but as you may find out during the episode, it’s the magazine Ami does modeling for. The text on the mag is really not interesting either. It might be referring to the existing magazine [Can! Cam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_Cam) though.

03:04 Labor girl back-jab at previous joke. Minorin is a mysterious laborer, remember [episode 3 notes](http://blog.ilif.in/2008/10/17/toradora-episode-3-translation-notes/)? It’s at 07:25.

09:02 Taiga’s confusing her hunger with her anger, or being both at once and trying to figure which one to comment on. This is a japanese play on words. The first, getting hungry, “hara ga heru”, literally means your stomach is getting lighter, while the second “hara ga tatsu” means your stomach is… standing. She has mixed up the expressions.

09:45 The above gets backed up by another funnies from the japanese crowd, when Taiga’s saying she’ll gulp down her anger. She decided to neither be hungry or angry.

14:33 The Tale of Genji. This shit is famous, so if you don’t get this, you’ll have to read up some. [Wall of text is at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_Genji). Note that I’ve attempted to translate how the teacher tries to explain how the story is written and makes sense, even with the really old japanese phrasing that is being used. The Tale of Genji is commonly used in japanese literature history classes or whatnot, I guess?

14:40 Oh Minorin, you and your crazy shit. This was very well delivered in the anime, but I laughed more in the novels. I like how they tied in the humor with that… sick design on her, from some very popular and very commonly reference horror manga artist I just can’t seem to remember,

15:11 Not an episode without Minorin references. This time, we’ve got a Yatterman reference. This really escapes me how works, but it’s something about the tandem bicycles some characters are using, involving playing some Beethoven songs in the background while it happens etc. The “oshioki da beee” as she says, is actually divine punishment.

20:09 Sailor Moon. Sailor Mercury’s name is Mizuno Ami (水野亜美), compare this to Kawashima Ami (川嶋亜美). Their first names are the same, and they are written the same way. In addition, their last names are read similarly in terms of what they mean; Mizuno = water field, Kawashima = river island. Also fun fact, Ami = “Sub-beauty”, hinting at <spoilers> that is to come.

21:22 Holy shit how popular is Ami? Putting out notices when a model stops showing up in magazines for a while is apparently normal, but what the hell, Ami?
