00:52 Early with the weird crap this time. What Minorin is ranting about here early on is a reference to the commonly known (for japanese people) “rule” that specifies that you can’t bring snacks worth more than 300 yen for school excursions. Minorin’s pointing out that the excess flab in Ami’s gut has to be worth way more than 300 yen, so she can’t bring it along. She’s also squeezing her stomach flesh so that it looks like bananas, which is why she comments on it like the excess is bananas. She also points out which points of Ami’s stomach “contains” which extremely fat consumable product.

01:05 Okay, this gets it’s own note. I’ll actually ask the readers for which show this might be referencing. Sainy Seiya? Any other random sentai show? Whichever it is, this is a typical HOLY SHIT SPECIAL MOVE type of scene, this time involving Minorin’s dieting warriors.

07:46 Here comes what’s making this episode take so much time. Ami is being forced to imitate things by Taiga, and she is listing some of them. Take note on what type of things she is being forced to imitate, as Taiga is thoroughly making her do things that in some way is hinting at people who you could say are all keeping up facades, just like Ami is.

07:46 Jackson: Obviously Michael Jackson.

07:47 Uganda: This is Uganda Tora, also known as Sato Shinichiro. Famous overweight star in the comedy band Bee Gee Four, and has done some anime voice work in Turn A Gundam. Has a very distinct way of being himself or something. [Read more here](https://web.archive.org/web/20080902030452/http://asianmediawiki.com/Uganda_Tora).

07:51 Falcon: As taken from the novels, this is Falcon. I have no idea WHICH Falcon, yet the only defining Falcon I know for the japanese is [CAPTAIN FALCON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Falcon) of the FALCON PUNCH, which is fairly popular over there.

07:52 Akechi Mitsuhide: Person relevant to japanese history. Credited for killing big-shot guy Oda Nobunaga and he did tons of other shit. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akechi_Mitsuhide).

07:53 Matsumoto Seichou: Kinda-famous author and journalist who got some award. Wrote non-fiction and historical stuff and got some of his movies animated or something. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seicho_Matsumoto).

07:55 Oda Nobunaga: Probably the most known daimyo of all japanese history. He’s the big shot everyone likes to do shit with in their anime or manga, from a superhero cheese to a tentacle rapist reincarnation Suzuran probably has seen. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oda_Nobunaga).

07:57 Dazai Osamu: Famous 20th century writer in Japan, famous for writing about fantasy and suicides. Also an hero. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osamu_Dazai).

07:59 Susano-o: One of the many gods in japanese mythology, god of sea and storms. Taiga? [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanoo).

07:59 Amaterasu: Another god, or well, goddess. Goddess of the sun! Minorin? [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaterasu).

07:59 Uzume: Ame-no-Uzume-no-mikoto, yet another goddess. Rules of dawn and revelry. Ami? [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ame-no-Uzume).

07:59 Quetzalcóatl: Aztec god of sky and creation. Seen in about every fantasy game out there as some bird. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetzalcoatl).

07:59 Matthew: … the Evangelist. You probably know him. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_the_Evangelist).

07:59 Judas: If you know Matthew, you know Judas. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Iscariot).

09:04 Mona Lisa attacking a corner at 200 kilometers an hour: Ever seen car chases, or maybe car races? Initial D? Imagine Mona Lisa driving that car with her non-expression and drifting around a corner at 200 kilometers per hour. Yeah. [Famous paiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa).

09:08 A happy ‘The Thinker’: Will this guy smile, when you can’t even see his mouth in the statue? I bet Ami managed to. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thinker).

10:26 Konjac, or konnyaku if you want, is some slippery thing the japanese make that I really don’t like how tastes. It’s like… some gel. Only thing I know of it is the comedy with it from Kanon and that it tastes like crap. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konjac).

10:26 Thread-konjac is a form of the konjac from above where you cut the shit up into threads and it still tastes like crap, but not as bad. I like it in my oden. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ito_konnyaku).

10:33 Konbu’s a weird little kelp thing that tastes weird and looks weird and Minori has somehow made it look like sushi. I guess it’s all about the mindset for dieting warriors, not about what the food actually is? [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konbu).

11:04 Ryuuji’s lunch has been reduced to a rice-only lunch, or a noriben as Taiga says. It thus only consist of rice and seaweed, very manly. Also very boring. I don’t even have Wikipedia for this, I’m in despair.

15:01 Frogs returning to frogtown. “Frog” in japanese is 蛙 (kaeru). “Going home” / “”return” in japanese is 帰る (kaeru). I tried making this pun work in english by making the frog return to frogtown.

17:40 The stalker is calling Taiga a monster, or youkai, as the original japanese is. This is a catch-all-catch-none word for any kind of mythological monster in Japan. The guy doesn’t know what the fuck, and yet thinks Taiga is one. I am inclined to agree, as she did look dumb.

23:24 Okay, this is in the preview and if you’re wondering what the fuck just happened, allow me to elaborate. Next episode is going to be the famous “lol guys it’s a beach episode” troll episode of Toradora, where they make scenes that are canon from the novels into anime. This shit will be lol, and I have high expectations for both 4chan and Animesuki on the lol factor.

But where was I, the explanation. “Water-proof, water-repellent design.” “Delicate gradation.” “One-touch installation is possible.” All of these are common slogans for camera commercials and advertisements for them in general. Taiga’s small, and probably will wear a one-piece swimsuit. Her swimsuit is water-repelling, water-proof, will have nice layers of material for her nonexistant chest and she’ll fit right in since there’s nothing to fit in anyways. Ryuuji’s being funny here in the preview by making a swimsuit commercial sound like a camera commercial.

23:31 FAKE BREAST SPECIAL FORCE. This had me laughing for a while and NicoNico exploded from it. Taiga’s making a reference to the Ginyu Force from Dragon Ball Z fame. Note how the Dragon Ball Z version is written ギニュー特戦隊 (ginyuu tokusentai) while what Taiga is saying is written 偽乳特戦隊 (ginyuu tokusentai). They’re read the same way, yet mean something completely different. 偽乳 (ginyuu) is fake breasts. The rest of it is the same. Who is it in the show that has pads? My guess is Nanako.
