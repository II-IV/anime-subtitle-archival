# Translation Notes

I usually write a little rant before all translation notes, here’s one this time too. Our episode is way behind cause of a pile of stuff stacking onto me and stuff not going our way in the crew. Fret not, we should get back on schedule the coming weeks as long as I don’t too much of my free time stolen. Onto the episode; I never felt the need to note about anything in this episode, primarily since I worked hard to make it as comprehensible as possible in English. Secondly, there are really no special gags here. Minorin is being her regular wacky self, but I felt no need to note on it as we made the English she speaks weird instead. However, there are some terms.

07:15 “Absit omen” - kuwabara kuwabara. From what I collect, this is a chant to ward off evil. It is commonly translated to “absit omen”, and somtimes it as “knock on wood” - which would be wrong in the general concensus of the term, while the Pagan term for “knock on wood” would be correct. Since Sakagami is an American fool, I am now writing this.

07:25 Thermal shirt. You all know I’m Norwegian by now, and I have no idea what a thermal shirt is in English. In Norway, we call these SUPERUNDERTØY (super-underwear). What Ryuuji is referring to is what the Japanese call a “babashatsu” - literally “old woman’s shirt”. These shirts are really warm, tight - or loose - thin - or sometimes thick - shirts that “breathe” and prevent you from sweating and giving off bodily odors, while keeping you warm. In Japan they were originally focused towards keeping you warm in cold weather, but recent days they’ve seem to become more widespread and produced for other uses, and not always entirely focused on keeping you warm. Had a real attention-boom during Japan’s WARM BIZ campaign.

07:36 “Shitty old man” - or kusojijii. Taiga is, literally, calling her dad a shitty old man. In order for this to make sense, you see Ryuuji referring to her father as “old man” in some cases, depending on which word he uses for “dad”.

08:23+ Inko-chan is a master of word play? See the above, kusojijii - shitty old man. Inko-chan now goes on with iboji - hemorrhoids. As I have previously noted, Inko-chan is being taught how to say Inko-chan, and mixes other words it hears often with it.

09:30 This really shouldn’t need pointing out - but some people wanted me to; Taigaa = Tiger. Her classmates call her タイガー, as in Tiger. Ryuuji and Minorin say 大河, as in her first name, Taiga. Ami uses 大河 too, but adds -chan to it since they’re not as close. In order to keep this naming consistency up and not just call her Taiga regardless - since we already put her as Palmtop Tiger - you’ll see “the Tiger” a lot. I am matching this up with how the convos go in the novels, so they should be fairly consistent.

11:53 Does everyone know Buddhism? No? Right. Depending on which Buddhism you look at, they believe that there are many “stages” of hell. In her fury, Taiga wants to haunt Ami when she is going through the endless cycle of birth, death and reincarnation, which the Buddhist believe in; the transmigration. So yeah, she’s being unreasonable and also very religious at the same time? Can’t have one without the other.

13:54 This is probably the only note I felt was necessary, in order to “get” more about why they detail out what Ryuuji and Taigas dad are getting. Taiga loves cheese, and would order food in the exact same way as her dad. They are really similar in this part, which is why you see Ryuuji smiling to himself here.

15:26 They have stolen towels from Yacchan’s work. What the hell?

19:12 The editor and QC team murdered my translation here for some reason, and I really don’t like them having done so. Here’s the original line from my TL script:
_One! Your class will have first priority on getting next year’s planned replacement state-of-the-art air-conditioner, providing plenty of moisture, installed in your class by the end of the month!_
I fail to see how all this possibly is being retained by the line in the script:
_One! Your class will be getting next year’s new state-of-the-art humidifying air conditioner installed!_

19:56 “Buri” -> “Teri” -> “Yaki”. [Teriyaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teriyaki) made of [amberjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amberjack). Buri teriyaki.
