00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,530

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,900
Sheesh.

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:17,160
You tossed your skirt in the laundry basket with a tissue still in its pocket, didn't you?

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,410
It was a disaster.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,630
Also, make sure that you separate your clothes based on their colors. The dark colored ones go in the orange basket-

6
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,340
Shut up! Shut up!

7
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,340
Stop nitpicking on every little thing!

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,090

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,170

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,840
Yay, yay, yay!

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,180

12
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,600

13

14

15
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,810
Yay, yay, yay!

16

Don't worry about it!

17
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,070
All right!

18
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,240

19

Second base! Yay!

27
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,650
Turning at the third base, and we have a home run!

28
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,410

29
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,870

31

Stop it with that lewd look, you disgusting dog.

32
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,310
Kushieda, about the weekend's co-ed practice...

33
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,230
Oh hey, Kitamura-kun. I was about to-

34
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,450
Hey, are you listening to me, you stupid dog?!

35
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,770
Stop doing that-

36
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,770
Wait!

37
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,020

38

39
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,040

42

A cellphone decoration? You're really dexterous with your fingers.

43
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:38,170
You could say that. I might not look it, but I'm rather crafty with my hands.

44
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,010
What's Kushieda doing?

45
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,430
All right, one down!

46

What's up with that smothered voice?

48
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,360
Um, y-you see...

49
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,660
Hey, why don't I decorate yours too, Takasu-kun?

50
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,200
You see, I'm a part-time cellphone decorator.

51
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,830
D-Decorator?

52
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,080
I'll spell out "Ryuuji" with purple Swarovski stones on yours.

53
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,590
[Ryuuji]

54
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,500
She'd do that for me...?

55
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,220
No, I-I'm all rig...

56
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,380
No, I-I'm all rig...

57
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,090

58
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,260
Please decorate ours, too.

59
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,600
I see, more orders!

60
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,310
On this paper, write down your name, the color you want, and a small drawing.

61
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,730
To give it a lovely feeling, I'll go with a large heart and the color pink.

62
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:39,820
That's lovely!

63
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,620
So she's a part-time cellphone decorator...

64
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,960
The sparkling Kushieda and her sparkling
decorations. What a wonderful combination.

65
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,090
Hey, Yacchan's not eating here since she's at the hostess club, right? Then can I have her side dish...

66
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:04,840
And she said "Ryuuji." She remembered my first name...

67
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,050
That's because I address you like that all the time.

68
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,270
But anyway, about Yacchan's side dish...

69
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,930
Oh man, I talked with her so much...

70
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,060
Taiga, was I able to talk normally with...

71
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,400
...her?

72
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,940
Listen when people are talking to you!

73
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,990
And no, you sounded really shady!

74
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,370
What about dinner, is it ready yet?

75
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,950
That hurt, you know! It's almost done.

76
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,330
Today, we're having a rice bowl dish, so as long as we have rice we'll be ok-

77
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,710
What the?!

78
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,830
What's wrong?

79
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,460
The rice cooker's broken.

80
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,720
Welcome and good evening!

81
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,510
What should I get?

82
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,020
Going all the way out to a family restaurant...

83
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,190
We didn't have any rice, but there was bread.

84
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,520
Bay while you can, mongrel.

85
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,690
Soon, you'll be kneeling your head in gratitude.

86
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,900
And here you go, two servings!

87
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,950
Huh? But we haven't ordered anyth-

88
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:10,370
What?!

89
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,040
Keep this a secret. An extra large serving of ice cream, the Taiga Special!

90
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,630
Hide it from the other customers while you eat it, okay?

91
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,420
Thanks for making it every time, Minorin.

92
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,510
"Every time"?

93
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,420
Takasu-kun doesn't like sweet things?

94
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,890
Then how about some french fries?

95
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:32,640
I'll give you a huge serving! A <i>huge</i>  serving!

convenience stores and karaoke clubs, right?

98
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,940
Yeah! And last week, I added a shabu-shabu place to the list!

99
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,230

100
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,400
And I'm still saving time for other things!

101
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,660
Being the girls' softball club's captain, I can't possibly skip club activities, after all.

102
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,160
Are you working so hard because you want something in particular?

103
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,580
Nah, I've just got the time so I gotta labor.

104
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,870
"Labor"?

105
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,750
Yes, the "Mysterious Files of Labor"!

106
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,460
The kind of labor that revives you!

107
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,720
But, wow, you two sure are close now.

108
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,100
Waitress, some cold water, please.

109
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,730
Well, enjoy your time here.

110
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:38,250
I'm pretty sure I've lost some eyesight because you've been poking my eyes all day.

111
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,880
You pitiful mongrel, drooling while checking out Minorin's uniform...

112
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,710
I was just thinking...

113
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,180
...that her smile was so bright...

114
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,140

115
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,560

117
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,770
But why is she juggling all those jobs?

118
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,320
She called it the "Mysterious Files of Labor", didn't she?

119
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,160
Could it be possible that she has a reason for earning all that money?

120
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,740
Something related to her home? Maybe she's helping her sick mom?

121
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,490
She called it laboring.

122
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,040
But even so...

123
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,460
You should stop assuming things.

124
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:26,970
Huh?

125
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:31,260
"I'm the only one who truly understands her!"

126
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,130
It'll only add on to your filth level.

127
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,100
Ew, how gross! Keep your distance from me, you're so disgusting!

128
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,730
Hey, Taiga! What's with your tone, you're so cold!

00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:50,490
Stay away from me! Since when have I <i>not</i>  been cold towards you?

130
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,990
Now that you mention it...

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,200
Hi, Inko-chan! Sorry to make you wait, it's dinner time!

I shouldn't have told you...

142
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,320
Did you say something?

143
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,080
Not bothering to prepare breakfast in order to see Minorin at the family restaurant...

144
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,040
It can't be helped, the rice cooker is still broken.

145
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,250
Then why don't we go to an electrical appliance store first?

00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,590
Another!

180
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:19,680
And some more!

181
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,930
It would be better if I-

182
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:29,600
No, it's okay. Sit down and relax with some tea. You're Mirano-chan's son, after all.

183
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,690
Why do I have to do this?

184
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,610
I ask her for some help, but only during holidays.

185
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,110
Kushieda, you better work hard!

186
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,120
Understood!

187
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,580
We've run out of workers these days, now that we're so busy.

188
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,080
You ran out of workers...?

189
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,500
Oh yeah, do you want to work here too, young lady? Being friends with Kushieda and all...

190
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,380
I'll pay you well!

191
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,260
Yes!

192
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,350
I'll work!

193
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,810
Along with her.

194
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,440
I can't keep this up!

195
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,990
Hey, don't cause a ruckus. It'll give Kushieda trouble.

196
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,860
Then help out a little!

197
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,820
Little girl, I need you to go do the deliveries!

198
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,160
Three of those beer cases.

199
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,910
With pleasure!

200
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,210
And that's it!

201
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,420
Be careful.

202
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,760
What's wrong, Taiga?

203
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,480
You...

204
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,480
You can't ride a bike?

205
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,280
Shut up!

206
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:05,410
So what if I can't ride a bike?! I'll just have to transport it like this!

207
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,160
That's wrong! You're doing it wrong!

208
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,870
You're on fire, Taiga!

209
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,620
She's ridiculous.

210
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,790
Well, if she just pushes the bike, she'll be all right.

211
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,210
Oh, right, I was going to restock the shochu.

212
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:26,970
I'll-

213
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,680
I'll help, too.

214
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,390
I'd feel bad if I wasn't doing anything.

215
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,360
Then I'll be counting on you.

216
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,570
Y-Yeah!

217
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Where's the potato shochu?

218
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,500
It's really hard to see in this darkness.

219
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,340
This place isn't used that often.

220
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,260
They don't open up this place more than once a week or so.

221
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,560
If we got locked in here, it'd be horrible.

222
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,600
It would feel almost like we were stranded or something!

223
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:21,610
That little runt, leaving it open like that.

224
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,950
Hey! There are still people inside!

225
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,700
S.O.S.! S.O.S.!

226
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,960
Calm down, Takasu-kun!

227
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,540
Kushieda?

228
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,500
It's for these times that we have school songs!

229
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,710
Huh?

230
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,750
School songs?

231
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,910
This is dumb.

232
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,620
There's no reason for me to make an effort.

233
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,790
I really can't keep this up.

234
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,710
Keep what up?

235
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:27,420
K-Kitamura-kun! W-Why are you h-h-here?

236
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,920
Self-training.

237
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,390
By the way, is that your bike?

238
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:39,270
Um, yeah... something like that.

239
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,520
You're capable of riding a bike now?

240
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,400
That's remarkable progress.

241
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,200
Um, putting aside whether I can ride a bike or not...

242
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:57,240
How did you know that I didn't know how to ride a bike?

243
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,370
That's because I was closely observing you last year.

244
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,840
Bikes are great. The world opens up before you.

245
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,760
I'll see you tomorrow.

246
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:22,600
He was observing me last year...?

247
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,030
Damnit!

248
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,410
Damnit!

249
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,170
Opening up a world in which
Kitamura-kun's not watching me...

250
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:55,260
...is meaningless!

251
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,770
Two, thr-

252
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,190
Aren't you lat- What happened, you look awful.

253
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,030
Nothing much. Where are the others?

254
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:14,070
Oh, right, where has that Kushieda run off to?

255
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,740
Not minding Ryuuji-kun...

256
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,540
That mongrel, slacking off in comfort while I'm out working!

257
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,370
What're you saying?

258
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,330
Anyway, the next delivery's three blocks away-

259
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:32,300
Ryuuji, what the hell are you up to?!

260
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:40,970
♪ The bridge that leads to the future ♫

261
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,810
♫ That bridge is a chopstick, a chopstick ♪

262
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,810
My throat's all dry.

263
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,150
Nobody noticed us even though we raised our voices...

264
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,860
Around this time, the old guy's obsessing over horse racing.

265
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,200
Right...

266
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,450
It's gotten a bit cold.

267
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,200
I'll lend you my coat, the-

268
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,330
Okay, let's warm up!

269
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:12,500
The pitcher is scared! Hey, hey, hey!

270
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,920
Who's scared? Aren't you the pitcher?

271
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,430
He's scared! Hey!

272
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:23,770
The pitcher is scared! Hey, hey, hey!

273
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,100
Wait, you're actually scared?

274
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,440
Your hand's trembling.

275
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,730
You've got it all wrong, I'm trembling from excitement!

276
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:33,980
Here I go, you'd better be ready!

277
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,780
Strike!

278
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,870
Changeover.

279
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,450
We swap places now.

280
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,540
Oh, okay.

281
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,710
You see, there's no point being afraid.

282
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,790
That's why...

283
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,170
I only need to beat up my weakness!

284
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,090
Kushieda...

285
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,390
Could it be...

286
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,100
Could it be possible?

287
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,190
Hey, Takasu-kun. Can't we get out through that window?

288
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,820
Where is he?! Where is he?! Where is he?! Where is he?! Where is he?! Where is he?!

289
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,400
WHERE IS HE?!

290
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,700
Look, Takasu-kun.

291
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:24,660
So you're in there...!

292
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:34,800
There might be more to Kushieda's cheerfulness than her simply being bright and energetic.

293
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,010
Watch out!

294
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,840
I'm sorry, Kushieda! Are you oka-

295
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,850
Whoa, your nose is bleeding!

296
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,180
Oh, it'll be okay somehow!

297
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,770
Somehow?

298
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,980
A nosebleed is the perspiration of your heart.

299
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:54,020
That aside, we're almost there!

300
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,650
Keep stacking them boxes, Takasu!

301
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,650
Y-Yes, sir!

302
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,990
I see, she was beating up her weakness, wasn't she?

303
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,200
We're going to get out of here!

304
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,160
Yeah, of course! Fight!

305
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,910
Huh?

306
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,040
When I say fight, you say...?

307
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,500
O-one more time?

308
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,880
Yeah yeah, that's it!

309
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,460
Fight!

310
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,630
O-one more time!

311
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,630
Now that I think about it,

312
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,140
she's always been gleaming with cheerfulness.

313
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,390
Even when I had just met her too.

314
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,520
Fight!

315
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,600
Even now...

316
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,770
Chug one!

317
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:36,940
She's gleaming with joy!

318
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:40,570
FOUND YOU!

319
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,360
FOUND YOU!

320
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,150
FOUND YOU!

321
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,280
FOUND YOU!

322
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,920
Taiga, how did you get in here?!

323
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,220
How? I used the ladder.

324
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,840
Yay! We can get outside now, Takasu-kun!

325
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:06,800
But...

326
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,220
Thanks, Taiga!

327
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,430
This is truly the ladder to the future!

328
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,560
Um, Minorin...

329
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,390
You get up too, Takasu-kun!

330
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,390
O-Okay.

331
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,980
Like I've been trying to say!

332
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,190
The ladder fell down when I landed on Ryuuji's face...

333
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:34,920
Next Episode Preview: The Face Back Then

334
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,310
Sealed deep within my heart.

335
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:30,180
Our precious memory that we couldn't tell anyone about.

336
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,360
Nope, I've told Takasu.

337
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,950
Ki-ta-mu-!
