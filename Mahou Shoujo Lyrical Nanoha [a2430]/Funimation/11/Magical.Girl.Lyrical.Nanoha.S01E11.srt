1
00:00:02,947 --> 00:00:06,883
It was a small incident that happened
to me, Nanoha Takamachi,

2
00:00:06,885 --> 00:00:09,725
a girl who was supposed to be
an ordinary third-grader.

3
00:00:10,822 --> 00:00:15,102
I believed in the heart of courage,
and I gained magical powers.

4
00:00:16,094 --> 00:00:19,762
The feeling that you can't twist
something you've decided...

5
00:00:19,764 --> 00:00:21,432
The feeling that you don't
want to run away...

6
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:23,423
I understand those just a little.

7
00:00:24,302 --> 00:00:28,038
That's why, right now, we'll have
our first and last serious battle.

8
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:30,149
Risking everything we have
on our magic!

9
00:00:31,476 --> 00:00:33,277
I'll tell you over and over.

10
00:00:33,278 --> 00:00:35,088
Because I want to see your smile.

11
00:00:36,748 --> 00:00:40,178
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha
is about to begin!

12
00:00:57,702 --> 00:01:01,839
Cradling my knees in
a corner of my room

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,042
I always shivered from uncertainty

14
00:01:05,043 --> 00:01:10,043
I was scared of learning the truth,
so I closed the door

15
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:17,250
I found my own place within a kind lie
and I fled inside my dreams

16
00:01:19,757 --> 00:01:24,757
I dye a sea of loneliness that
nobody knows of into a deep blue

17
00:01:27,999 --> 00:01:32,999
An intense feeling to
hide the loneliness

18
00:01:33,938 --> 00:01:38,938
Is continually injuring your heart

19
00:01:40,178 --> 00:01:44,881
The secret hidden deep
within the eyes

20
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:49,419
To the truth behind the smile
that draws me in

21
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,420
I will deliver a love so soft

22
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:59,363
Right now, a warmth that might
break upon touching it

23
00:01:59,364 --> 00:02:03,967
Parts itself from the past,
and overflows

24
00:02:03,968 --> 00:02:08,505
I'll be by your side forever

25
00:02:08,506 --> 00:02:17,566
Do not be lured into
the somber shadows

26
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,410
Mother... My mother...

27
00:02:39,437 --> 00:02:42,839
My mother was always kind.

28
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,940
My mother called out
my name so gently.

29
00:02:47,078 --> 00:02:49,478
See? These are very pretty, Alicia.

30
00:02:50,848 --> 00:02:52,082
Alicia?

31
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,917
That's not right, Mother.

32
00:02:53,918 --> 00:02:55,558
I'm Fate.

33
00:02:56,454 --> 00:02:58,594
Now, come here, Alicia.

34
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:09,641
See? You're so cute, Alicia.

35
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,290
I guess it's all right.

36
00:03:33,091 --> 00:03:36,371
Because I love my kind mother...

37
00:03:41,032 --> 00:03:46,272
Memories That Lie Beyond Time

38
00:03:50,908 --> 00:03:53,376
It looks like the battle will begin.

39
00:03:53,378 --> 00:03:54,277
Yeah.

40
00:03:54,278 --> 00:03:56,588
But this really is unusual.

41
00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:00,559
For you to allow such
a gamble, Chrono...

42
00:04:01,986 --> 00:04:06,023
Well, it's for the best if Nanoha wins.

43
00:04:06,024 --> 00:04:09,804
But the winner of this battle
doesn't really matter that much.

44
00:04:11,929 --> 00:04:15,932
While Nanoha is buying us
time with her battle,

45
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:19,503
we'll prepare for pursuit of that girl's
route in returning home, right?

46
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,141
I'm counting on you.

47
00:04:24,142 --> 00:04:25,482
So don't let her get away.

48
00:04:26,577 --> 00:04:27,867
Yeah, leave it to me!

49
00:04:29,914 --> 00:04:30,873
Oh?

50
00:04:33,317 --> 00:04:36,627
But don't you have to tell Nanoha,

51
00:04:38,056 --> 00:04:41,015
about Precia Testarossa's family,
and about that incident?

52
00:04:44,962 --> 00:04:48,098
It's best if she wins.

53
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:50,969
I don't want Nanoha to be worried
about anything right now.

54
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:05,241
Photon Lancer.

55
00:05:13,024 --> 00:05:14,364
Divine Shooter.

56
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:22,916
Fire!

57
00:05:23,434 --> 00:05:24,924
Shoot!

58
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,790
Shoot!

59
00:05:39,016 --> 00:05:40,006
Scythe Form.

60
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,340
Round Shield.

61
00:06:17,088 --> 00:06:18,138
Flash Move.

62
00:06:35,673 --> 00:06:36,903
Scythe Slash.

63
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:46,983
Fire!

64
00:07:03,534 --> 00:07:05,402
When I first met her,

65
00:07:05,403 --> 00:07:08,638
she was a novice, with nothing
but high magical power.

66
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,273
Not any more.

67
00:07:10,274 --> 00:07:11,854
She's quick, and she's tough.

68
00:07:12,743 --> 00:07:14,993
If I'm indecisive, she'll get me!

69
00:07:31,762 --> 00:07:33,022
Phalanx Shift.

70
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:46,743
Lightning Bind...

71
00:07:46,744 --> 00:07:48,879
This isn't good. Fate is serious!

72
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,814
Nanoha! I'll back you up now!

73
00:07:50,815 --> 00:07:51,985
You can't!

74
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:56,788
Miss Aruf... Yuuno...
Please, don't interfere.

75
00:07:58,189 --> 00:07:59,999
It's a duel at full strength between us.

76
00:08:00,758 --> 00:08:03,293
A battle between Fate and me!

77
00:08:03,294 --> 00:08:06,696
But that thing Fate's doing
is really bad!

78
00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:07,657
I'm fine!

79
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:10,349
Alcus Curtus Agias...

80
00:08:11,535 --> 00:08:13,403
Spears of thunder becoming a gust,

81
00:08:13,404 --> 00:08:16,139
shoot through that to which
you are guided now.

82
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,130
Paruer Zaruer Brouzel...

83
00:08:22,246 --> 00:08:24,205
Photon Lancer, Phalanx Shift!

84
00:08:27,852 --> 00:08:29,842
Hit, and destroy! Fire!

85
00:08:48,606 --> 00:08:49,739
Nanoha!

86
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,050
Fate?!

87
00:09:22,406 --> 00:09:23,707
When you're done shooting,

88
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,988
that Bind thing loses effect, right?

89
00:09:26,877 --> 00:09:28,678
This time, it's my...

90
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,759
Divine...

91
00:09:32,216 --> 00:09:33,683
.Â«.turn!

92
00:09:33,684 --> 00:09:34,584
Buster.

93
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,033
Direct hit!

94
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:52,041
But I can withstand it!

95
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:54,596
Because she withstood my attack too!

96
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:19,616
Fate!

97
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:29,939
Try taking this one.

98
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,990
A variation of the Divine Buster...

99
00:10:35,613 --> 00:10:37,283
Starlight Breaker.

100
00:10:47,992 --> 00:10:48,891
Bind?!

101
00:10:51,796 --> 00:10:54,016
This attack is me at my full strength!

102
00:10:55,332 --> 00:10:58,372
Starlight Breaker!

103
00:11:13,984 --> 00:11:16,086
What a ludicrous amount
of magical power!

104
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:18,957
Wow... I wonder if Fate is still alive?

105
00:11:42,713 --> 00:11:43,642
Fate!

106
00:12:08,606 --> 00:12:10,446
Are you awake, Fate?

107
00:12:11,942 --> 00:12:14,132
I'm sorry... Are you all right?

108
00:12:16,814 --> 00:12:18,863
I won, right?

109
00:12:21,752 --> 00:12:23,186
Yes...

110
00:12:23,187 --> 00:12:24,327
It seems so.

111
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:27,218
Put out.

112
00:12:31,495 --> 00:12:32,345
Can you fly?

113
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:41,938
All right, Nanoha,
grab the Jewel Seeds,

114
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:43,173
and then get her...

115
00:12:43,174 --> 00:12:44,223
No, she's here!

116
00:12:50,548 --> 00:12:51,418
Fate!

117
00:13:02,126 --> 00:13:04,194
Bingo! Caught her by the tail!

118
00:13:04,195 --> 00:13:05,195
All right.

119
00:13:05,196 --> 00:13:08,598
A careless material transfer
will cost lives... The coordinates?

120
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:10,619
Already determined,
and I'm sending them now!

121
00:13:11,869 --> 00:13:14,239
All armed personnel, mobilize
from the transfer ports!

122
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:18,841
Your mission is the capture
of Precia Testarossa!

123
00:13:18,842 --> 00:13:19,832
Yes, ma'am!

124
00:13:27,718 --> 00:13:29,018
Just as I thought...

125
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:31,629
I can no longer physically
bear dimensional magic.

126
00:13:32,456 --> 00:13:35,996
And, with that last one,
they discovered this location.

127
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:39,229
Fate...

128
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,780
That girl was no good after all.

129
00:13:41,932 --> 00:13:44,482
I guess it's about time to call it quits.

130
00:14:15,232 --> 00:14:17,267
Squadron Two has
completed transfer.

131
00:14:17,268 --> 00:14:19,318
Squadron One has begin infiltration.

132
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:22,739
Thank you for the hard work.

133
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,974
And... Miss Fate, was it?

134
00:14:24,975 --> 00:14:26,375
Nice to meet you.

135
00:14:34,718 --> 00:14:38,554
I'd prefer not to show her
the scene of her mother's arrest.

136
00:14:38,555 --> 00:14:41,291
Miss Nanoha, please take her
to a different room.

137
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:42,992
Okay.

138
00:14:42,993 --> 00:14:45,573
Fate, if you'd like,
you can come to my room...

139
00:14:47,264 --> 00:14:49,299
All men have entered
the throne room,

140
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,589
and have confirmed the target!

141
00:14:51,302 --> 00:14:53,569
Precia Testarossa,
you are under arrest

142
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,638
for violation of the time-space laws

143
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:58,189
and charges of attacking
a Bureau flagship!

144
00:14:58,876 --> 00:15:00,656
Disarm yourself and come here.

145
00:15:11,355 --> 00:15:12,622
Cover that side!

146
00:15:12,623 --> 00:15:13,823
There's something over here!

147
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,400
This is...

148
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:52,218
Don't come near my Alicia!

149
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:57,567
Fire!

150
00:16:02,706 --> 00:16:03,756
Shut up.

151
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,940
Look out! Block it!

152
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:25,628
This isn't good! Recall all agents!

153
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:26,529
Roger!

154
00:16:27,398 --> 00:16:29,966
Alicia?

155
00:16:29,967 --> 00:16:32,635
Coordinate lock: 012A503.

156
00:16:32,636 --> 00:16:33,069
Locked!

157
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:33,770
Transfer operation, stand by.
Locked!

158
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:34,621
Transfer operation, stand by.

159
00:16:42,646 --> 00:16:45,948
It's no good now. I have no time.

160
00:16:45,949 --> 00:16:48,418
With only nine Lost Logia,

161
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:52,169
I don't know whether or not
I will reach Alhazard.

162
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:58,862
But it's fine now. I will end it all.

163
00:16:59,997 --> 00:17:03,247
All the time spent in depression
after losing this child,

164
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:08,540
and treating a scapegoat of
a doll of her as my daughter.

165
00:17:12,175 --> 00:17:13,776
Are you listening?

166
00:17:13,777 --> 00:17:15,797
I'm talking about you, Fate.

167
00:17:16,814 --> 00:17:19,749
I went through the effort of
giving you Alicia's memories,

168
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,151
but the only resemblance
was your appearance.

169
00:17:22,152 --> 00:17:25,454
You were of no use whatsoever.

170
00:17:25,455 --> 00:17:27,475
A mere doll of mine.

171
00:17:29,193 --> 00:17:30,833
Back in that first incident...

172
00:17:31,728 --> 00:17:36,298
Precia lost her real daughter,
Alicia Testarossa.

173
00:17:37,768 --> 00:17:40,336
In the end, she was
researching the creation

174
00:17:40,337 --> 00:17:42,738
of an artificial life form
different from a familiar,

175
00:17:42,739 --> 00:17:45,399
a being that surpasses all familiars.

176
00:17:47,077 --> 00:17:49,417
And the secret of reviving the dead...

177
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,849
"Fate" is the developers' code

178
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:55,480
that she had assigned to
her research at the time.

179
00:17:57,054 --> 00:17:59,322
I'm impressed you were able
to find out that much.

180
00:17:59,323 --> 00:18:01,223
You're right. That's correct.

181
00:18:02,493 --> 00:18:05,893
But it's no good.
It didn't go well at all.

182
00:18:06,897 --> 00:18:09,617
An artificial life is nothing but a fake.

183
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:13,351
It doesn't take the place of
something that you've lost.

184
00:18:15,873 --> 00:18:19,063
Alicia smiled at me more kindly.

185
00:18:20,077 --> 00:18:23,012
Sometimes Alicia was selfish,

186
00:18:23,013 --> 00:18:26,749
but she listened well
to what I had to say.

187
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,650
Stop it!

188
00:18:28,252 --> 00:18:31,762
Alicia was always kind to me.

189
00:18:36,326 --> 00:18:37,793
Fate...

190
00:18:37,794 --> 00:18:40,694
You are, in the end, only a fake Alicia.

191
00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:44,834
I went through the effort of
giving you Alicia's memories,

192
00:18:44,835 --> 00:18:46,615
but you weren't good enough.

193
00:18:47,237 --> 00:18:49,517
Stop! Stop it!

194
00:18:51,108 --> 00:18:57,058
A doll I used to comfort myself until
I could bring Alicia back to life.

195
00:18:58,549 --> 00:19:01,183
So I don't need you anymore.

196
00:19:01,184 --> 00:19:03,553
Wherever you want to go, begone!

197
00:19:05,455 --> 00:19:07,504
Please, stop it already!

198
00:19:22,873 --> 00:19:25,875
I'll tell you one good thing, Fate...

199
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:30,876
Ever since I made you, all this time...

200
00:19:30,881 --> 00:19:32,841
I hated you!

201
00:19:44,861 --> 00:19:46,362
Fate!

202
00:19:46,363 --> 00:19:47,323
Fate...

203
00:19:47,998 --> 00:19:50,188
All agents have been retrieved.

204
00:19:51,602 --> 00:19:52,635
Big trouble!

205
00:19:52,636 --> 00:19:54,403
Please take a look at this!

206
00:19:54,404 --> 00:19:57,239
Magical responses from all over
the mansion... So many of them?!

207
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,474
What?

208
00:19:58,475 --> 00:19:59,814
What is going on here?

209
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:33,009
Magical responses from the Garden.
All of them are Class A!

210
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:36,178
Total numbers, 60.... 80...
The number is still increasing!

211
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:39,519
Precia Testarossa, what in the world
are you planning on doing?!

212
00:21:00,537 --> 00:21:04,847
I don't want you to
interrupt our journey.

213
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:11,199
We are going to depart!

214
00:21:18,288 --> 00:21:21,478
To the forgotten capital, Alhazard!

215
00:21:27,931 --> 00:21:28,891
Impossible!

216
00:21:29,266 --> 00:21:31,734
With this power,
we're going to depart,

217
00:21:31,735 --> 00:21:35,044
and take everything
back into our hands!

218
00:21:40,644 --> 00:21:43,045
It's a dimensional tremor!
Mid-size, or even bigger!

219
00:21:43,046 --> 00:21:44,380
Tremor defenses!

220
00:21:44,381 --> 00:21:46,315
Put up the distortion shields!

221
00:21:46,316 --> 00:21:48,184
Nine Jewel Seeds
have been executed.

222
00:21:48,185 --> 00:21:50,419
The dimensional tremor is
going to get even stronger!

223
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,521
Move to an area that
has a smaller affect,

224
00:21:52,522 --> 00:21:54,631
while remaining
within transfer radius!

225
00:21:55,158 --> 00:21:56,125
Roger that!

226
00:21:56,126 --> 00:21:57,593
The Radi coefficient is growing!

227
00:21:57,594 --> 00:21:59,434
At this rate, there will be
a dimensional fault!

228
00:22:02,065 --> 00:22:03,733
Alhazard...

229
00:22:03,734 --> 00:22:05,073
What idiocy!

230
00:22:05,769 --> 00:22:07,236
Chrono?!

231
00:22:07,237 --> 00:22:08,604
I'm going to go stop it!

232
00:22:08,605 --> 00:22:09,775
Open the gate!

233
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,180
The forgotten capital, Alhazard...

234
00:22:17,013 --> 00:22:20,583
The land where the forbidden secret
spells that we have lost all lie.

235
00:22:20,584 --> 00:22:23,119
What is she trying to do there?!

236
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,520
Does she think that she can bring
back the past that she has lost?!

237
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,068
No matter what magic you use,

238
00:22:39,069 --> 00:22:42,029
there is no way that you
can bring back the past!

239
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:13,946
Alicia and I are going to bring back
all of our past in Alhazard!

240
00:23:25,615 --> 00:23:26,549
Make a little wish

241
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:31,379
Even though at times
I'll trip or get lost

242
00:23:32,489 --> 00:23:42,339
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic

243
00:23:47,704 --> 00:23:52,704
Ah, going over the sea of cellophane
and over the forests

244
00:23:54,544 --> 00:23:58,214
Passing through the silver wind

245
00:23:58,215 --> 00:24:02,251
I was looking for something
neither of us had

246
00:24:02,252 --> 00:24:07,252
Ah, I was just crying inside
a diorama of a city

247
00:24:09,226 --> 00:24:14,226
Until I met that warm hand that
reached out to me that day

248
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,600
Among the swaying days,
I felt a strong gaze

249
00:24:23,773 --> 00:24:28,773
Hey, I finally, finally
found the secret key

250
00:24:32,182 --> 00:24:33,816
Make a little wish

251
00:24:33,817 --> 00:24:38,447
Collecting the lemon-colored
drops from the moon

252
00:24:39,756 --> 00:24:44,756
I want to keep a light shining
on the road that you travel down

253
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,364
Make a little wish

254
00:24:48,365 --> 00:24:53,165
I wonder if there is something
I can do even though I'm so little

255
00:24:54,204 --> 00:25:04,494
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic

256
00:25:12,522 --> 00:25:14,823
The dimensional tremor
has been set off.

257
00:25:14,824 --> 00:25:18,928
We head into the Garden of Time
to stop Precia.

258
00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:23,929
So that we don't break many worlds,
including Nanoha's world and ours...

259
00:25:24,734 --> 00:25:27,403
And at that moment, Fate...

260
00:25:27,404 --> 00:25:27,670
On the next episode of
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha:

261
00:25:27,671 --> 00:25:30,272
On the next episode of
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha:

262
00:25:30,273 --> 00:25:34,576
Episode 12:
The Time of the Sealing of Our Fates
Episode 12: The Time of
the Sealing of Our Fates

263
00:25:34,577 --> 00:25:37,737
Lyrical, magical, until
the very end, I'm sure!
