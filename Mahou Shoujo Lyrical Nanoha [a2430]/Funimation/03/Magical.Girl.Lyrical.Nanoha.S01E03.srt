1
00:00:08,061 --> 00:00:11,665
A sudden incident has befallen me,
Nanoha Takamachi,

2
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:14,326
a girl who was supposed to be
an ordinary third-grader.

3
00:00:16,337 --> 00:00:21,057
I was handed a red gem, and with it
I was given magical powers.

4
00:00:24,612 --> 00:00:28,802
Coincidences led by new meetings
start to move in silence.

5
00:00:30,752 --> 00:00:34,122
So that I don't look down on the days
where one stands up and fights...

6
00:00:37,024 --> 00:00:40,214
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha
is about to begin!

7
00:00:58,146 --> 00:01:02,082
Cradling my knees in
a corner of my room

8
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:05,452
I always shivered from uncertainty

9
00:01:05,453 --> 00:01:10,453
I was scared of learning the truth,
so I closed the door

10
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,660
I found my own place within a kind lie
and I fled inside my dreams

11
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:25,001
I dye a sea of loneliness that
nobody knows of into a deep blue

12
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,409
An intense feeling to
hide the loneliness

13
00:01:34,348 --> 00:01:39,348
Is continually injuring your heart

14
00:01:40,788 --> 00:01:45,292
The secret hidden deep
within the eyes

15
00:01:45,293 --> 00:01:49,830
To the truth behind the smile
that draws me in

16
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:54,831
I will deliver a love so soft

17
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:59,806
Right now, a warmth that might
break upon touching it

18
00:01:59,807 --> 00:02:04,377
Parts itself from the past,
and overflows

19
00:02:04,378 --> 00:02:08,914
I'll be by your side forever

20
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:18,006
Do not be lured into
the somber shadows

21
00:02:30,838 --> 00:02:33,418
Good evening, this is
Nanoha Takamachi!

22
00:02:44,018 --> 00:02:47,921
I'm usually an ordinary
third-grader, but lately,

23
00:02:47,922 --> 00:02:50,912
all sorts of things have been going on.

24
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:53,609
Stand by ready.

25
00:02:54,395 --> 00:02:56,096
Lyrical, magical...

26
00:02:56,097 --> 00:02:58,497
Jewel Seed, Serial 20...

27
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:00,977
Seal!

28
00:03:02,436 --> 00:03:03,306
Sealing.

29
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,589
Nanoha, thanks for the hard work.

30
00:03:27,962 --> 00:03:31,682
Well, I'm now working as
what you'd call a magical girl.

31
00:03:45,613 --> 00:03:47,043
Nanoha, are you all right?

32
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:51,575
I'm all right, but I'm a bit tired.

33
00:03:54,388 --> 00:03:56,118
Nanoha! Nanoha, are you all right?

34
00:03:56,824 --> 00:04:02,094
Episode 3: The City's
In a Lot of Danger?!

35
00:04:11,906 --> 00:04:14,596
Nanoha, it's morning.
You should get up soon.

36
00:04:15,576 --> 00:04:20,547
Today's Sunday, so let me
sleep in just a bit more.

37
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:21,881
Nanoha!

38
00:04:21,882 --> 00:04:25,392
I'm Nanoha Takamachi,
a third grader.

39
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,588
Thanks to an introduction
and a series of coincidences,

40
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:31,989
I met Yuuno, who is a mage
from another world.

41
00:04:32,994 --> 00:04:35,629
During the day, I'm an
ordinary grade-school girl,

42
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,198
and at night, I'm a magical girl,

43
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:41,949
searching for the Jewel Seeds,
which Yuuno is looking for.

44
00:04:52,546 --> 00:04:53,836
Confirmation.

45
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,425
It's been one week since I met Yuuno.

46
00:05:05,426 --> 00:05:08,962
We've collected a total
of five Jewel Seeds.

47
00:05:08,963 --> 00:05:14,413
I seem to be getting the hang
of this magical girl thing, but...

48
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,479
Nanoha, for today, you should
take care and rest up.

49
00:05:24,445 --> 00:05:26,012
But...

50
00:05:26,013 --> 00:05:27,714
We're taking a break today.

51
00:05:27,715 --> 00:05:30,050
You already found five for me,

52
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:32,919
so you need some rest,
or you won't last.

53
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,910
Besides, you have a promise
to keep today, right?

54
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,770
You're right.

55
00:05:39,226 --> 00:05:43,563
Then today we'll take a break
from the search for Jewel Seeds.

56
00:05:43,564 --> 00:05:44,434
Yeah.

57
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:58,011
Today, the soccer team
that my father,

58
00:05:58,012 --> 00:06:02,792
Shiro Takamachi, owns and coaches -
the Midoriya JFC - has a game.

59
00:06:04,385 --> 00:06:07,754
Arisa, Suzuka, and I
promised that we'd all

60
00:06:07,755 --> 00:06:10,655
go to the game to
cheer the players on.

61
00:06:12,026 --> 00:06:14,728
Now that a lot of the stands
are getting full,

62
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:17,230
would you like to start the game?

63
00:06:17,231 --> 00:06:18,431
Shall we?

64
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,976
Go for it! Everyone, do your best!

65
00:06:29,977 --> 00:06:32,637
This is one of the sports
on this world, right?

66
00:06:33,447 --> 00:06:36,027
Yeah, that's right. It's called soccer.

67
00:06:42,256 --> 00:06:43,690
You kick the ball with your feet,

68
00:06:43,691 --> 00:06:46,126
and you score a point when you
get it into the opponent's goal.

69
00:06:46,127 --> 00:06:49,295
Only the one in front of the goal
is allowed to use his hands.

70
00:06:49,296 --> 00:06:51,075
I see... It looks like fun.

71
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,575
Amazing goalie!

72
00:07:02,576 --> 00:07:03,426
Really!

73
00:07:06,013 --> 00:07:07,383
Get upfield, get upfield!

74
00:07:10,651 --> 00:07:14,654
Are there sports like this on the
world where you come from, Yuuno?

75
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:18,158
There are, but I was so engrossed
in research and excavation

76
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:19,938
that I didn't play much of anything.

77
00:07:21,028 --> 00:07:23,638
Just like me! I'm not
too good at sports.

78
00:07:24,298 --> 00:07:27,168
Midoriya J Sakuradai

79
00:07:28,135 --> 00:07:32,445
Game set! Midoriya JFC wins,
two to nothing!

80
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:36,825
All right!

81
00:07:40,314 --> 00:07:42,715
All right, all of you did a great job!

82
00:07:42,716 --> 00:07:45,185
That was a great game,
just like in practice!

83
00:07:45,186 --> 00:07:46,119
Yes, sir!

84
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,290
Then, to celebrate this victory,
let's have a feast!

85
00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:18,084
You know, upon a second look,

86
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:21,120
don't you think this guy's
a bit different from a ferret?

87
00:08:21,121 --> 00:08:22,789
Come to think of it,
maybe you're right?

88
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,660
The vet also said that he was
slightly different from usual.

89
00:08:28,762 --> 00:08:32,632
Well, I'm sure he's just
a slightly different ferret.

90
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:34,303
Here, Yuuno, shake!

91
00:08:37,871 --> 00:08:38,921
How cute!

92
00:08:39,773 --> 00:08:42,207
He's so smart!

93
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,228
So cute!

94
00:08:46,146 --> 00:08:47,647
Isn't he great?!

95
00:08:47,648 --> 00:08:48,581
I'm sorry, Yuuno.

96
00:08:48,582 --> 00:08:49,582
Good boy!
I'm sorry, Yuuno.

97
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:49,916
Good boy!

98
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:51,617
I'm fine...

99
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:56,289
Thanks for the meal!

100
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,930
Thank you so much!

101
00:08:58,392 --> 00:09:00,972
Everyone, today you did
a really good job!

102
00:09:01,896 --> 00:09:04,397
Let's practice hard again next week,

103
00:09:04,398 --> 00:09:06,866
and win the next tournament
just like we did today!

104
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:08,268
Yes, sir!

105
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:11,738
Then that's it for today! All of you,
be careful on your way home!

106
00:09:11,739 --> 00:09:13,673
Thank you very much!

107
00:09:13,674 --> 00:09:15,074
Good job, guys!

108
00:09:35,195 --> 00:09:36,362
Good job today!

109
00:09:36,363 --> 00:09:37,443
You too.

110
00:09:41,502 --> 00:09:43,236
That was just me, right?

111
00:09:43,237 --> 00:09:44,637
Oh, that was amusing!

112
00:09:44,638 --> 00:09:45,778
Here, Nanoha!

113
00:09:49,843 --> 00:09:53,279
Now, I guess that's it
for us today as well?

114
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,281
Yes, I think so.

115
00:09:55,282 --> 00:09:58,712
That's right. Everyone has
things to do this afternoon.

116
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,454
I'm going out with my sister.

117
00:10:01,455 --> 00:10:03,065
I'm going shopping with Papa!

118
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,926
That's great! Tell me
all about it on Monday.

119
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:08,537
Oh, you guys are
calling it a day as well?

120
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,040
Oh, Dad!

121
00:10:11,498 --> 00:10:15,234
Thank you so much
for inviting us today!

122
00:10:15,235 --> 00:10:16,985
The game was really cool!

123
00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:21,641
Thanks to both of you, Suzuka
and Arisa, for cheering us on.

124
00:10:21,642 --> 00:10:23,192
If you're going home, would
you like me to drive you?

125
00:10:23,811 --> 00:10:25,981
Oh no, I'm getting picked up.

126
00:10:26,647 --> 00:10:28,381
Same here!

127
00:10:28,382 --> 00:10:30,931
I see. What about you, Nanoha?

128
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:34,587
I'll go home and relax!

129
00:10:34,588 --> 00:10:35,637
I see.

130
00:10:36,323 --> 00:10:40,026
Your father's getting a quick bath
at home, then it's back to work.

131
00:10:40,027 --> 00:10:41,327
Would you like to
come home with me?

132
00:10:41,328 --> 00:10:42,198
Sure!

133
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:46,999
See ya later!

134
00:10:50,504 --> 00:10:52,054
See you tomorrow!

135
00:10:53,574 --> 00:10:56,442
Nanoha, did you grow taller again?

136
00:10:56,443 --> 00:10:59,612
Dad, you asked me that
just the other day!

137
00:10:59,613 --> 00:11:02,315
I don't grow that quickly!

138
00:11:02,316 --> 00:11:03,166
I see...

139
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,670
Nanoha, if you're going to bed,
at least change out of your clothes.

140
00:11:55,502 --> 00:11:58,572
You should get some rest too, Yuuno.

141
00:12:03,077 --> 00:12:06,147
I'm going to take a nap until dinner.

142
00:12:29,536 --> 00:12:33,726
Using magic when you're not used
to it must be very tiring after all.

143
00:12:35,442 --> 00:12:37,192
If only I were a bit more reliable...

144
00:12:56,363 --> 00:12:58,464
You were amazing today too.

145
00:12:58,465 --> 00:13:02,535
No, that's not true. See,
we always have good defense.

146
00:13:03,837 --> 00:13:06,087
But you were really cool!

147
00:13:12,446 --> 00:13:13,496
Oh, that's right.

148
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,700
Here.

149
00:13:19,486 --> 00:13:20,520
It's pretty!

150
00:13:20,521 --> 00:13:23,560
I think it's just a normal stone,
but since it was so pretty...

151
00:13:42,609 --> 00:13:43,509
Nanoha?!

152
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,380
Did you feel that?

153
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:07,533
What's up, Nanoha?

154
00:14:07,534 --> 00:14:09,001
Want to come in with me?

155
00:14:09,002 --> 00:14:11,604
Sorry, Dad, maybe next time!

156
00:14:11,605 --> 00:14:13,535
I'm gonna go out for a bit!

157
00:14:14,908 --> 00:14:16,928
Is that so? See you later...

158
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,100
Raging Heart, please!

159
00:14:30,557 --> 00:14:32,607
Stand by ready. Set up.

160
00:15:53,307 --> 00:15:54,807
How terrible...

161
00:15:54,808 --> 00:15:58,010
A human probably activated it.

162
00:15:58,011 --> 00:15:59,745
When someone with a strong will

163
00:15:59,746 --> 00:16:02,214
activates it by wishing hard into it,

164
00:16:02,215 --> 00:16:05,435
the Jewel Seed displays the
strongest amount of power.

165
00:16:09,623 --> 00:16:12,283
So it really was that boy that had it!

166
00:16:14,094 --> 00:16:16,344
I had noticed it, too!

167
00:16:18,665 --> 00:16:22,444
I might have been able to stop
all of this before it happened.

168
00:16:27,908 --> 00:16:28,958
Nanoha...

169
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:50,499
Nanoha?

170
00:16:50,897 --> 00:16:54,177
Yuuno, what should I do
at a time like this?

171
00:16:58,138 --> 00:16:59,128
Yuuno!

172
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:00,679
Right.

173
00:17:01,608 --> 00:17:03,747
You have to get close to it
in order to seal it.

174
00:17:04,678 --> 00:17:06,928
First, you have to find the
root area for all of this.

175
00:17:08,115 --> 00:17:10,750
But when it spreads out
to such a large area,

176
00:17:10,751 --> 00:17:12,718
how do you search for it?

177
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:14,720
So I just have to get to
the root of it all, right?

178
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:15,590
What?

179
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:21,215
Area Search.

180
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:29,769
Lyrical, magical...

181
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,080
Search for the root of the misfortune!

182
00:18:16,349 --> 00:18:17,283
I found it!

183
00:18:17,284 --> 00:18:18,274
Really?!

184
00:18:22,756 --> 00:18:24,256
I'll seal it right away!

185
00:18:24,257 --> 00:18:26,759
It's impossible from here!
You have to get closer!

186
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,220
I can do it! It's all right!

187
00:18:32,966 --> 00:18:36,235
Right, Raging Heart?

188
00:18:36,236 --> 00:18:38,170
Shooting Mode.

189
00:18:38,171 --> 00:18:39,191
Set up.

190
00:19:01,294 --> 00:19:03,164
Go and catch it!

191
00:19:21,414 --> 00:19:23,144
Stand by ready.

192
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:26,274
Lyrical, magical...

193
00:19:27,821 --> 00:19:30,130
Jewel Seed, Serial 10...

194
00:19:34,027 --> 00:19:35,017
Seal!

195
00:19:47,807 --> 00:19:48,737
Sealing.

196
00:20:33,587 --> 00:20:35,257
Receipt: No. X.

197
00:20:36,957 --> 00:20:38,297
Mode release.

198
00:20:45,165 --> 00:20:48,167
Thank you, Raging Heart.

199
00:20:48,168 --> 00:20:49,187
Good bye.

200
00:20:58,979 --> 00:21:01,169
Long-range magic
even I couldn't use...

201
00:21:02,382 --> 00:21:05,812
Just how much magical talent
does this girl have?

202
00:21:07,654 --> 00:21:10,856
We troubled all sorts
of people this time.

203
00:21:10,857 --> 00:21:11,527
What?

204
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:14,627
What are you talking about?

205
00:21:14,628 --> 00:21:16,678
Nanoha, you're doing a fine job!

206
00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:22,759
I'd noticed that he had it.

207
00:21:23,937 --> 00:21:26,486
But I thought it was
just my imagination.

208
00:21:32,245 --> 00:21:33,264
Nanoha!

209
00:21:35,882 --> 00:21:38,617
Please, don't look so sad!

210
00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:40,668
In the first place, it's all my fault,

211
00:21:41,354 --> 00:21:43,964
and you're just helping
me out, Nanoha!

212
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:47,980
Nanoha?!

213
00:21:48,695 --> 00:21:50,804
You're doing a fine job, Nanoha!

214
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:54,743
Nanoha...

215
00:21:59,172 --> 00:22:02,542
My first failure since
I became a mage...

216
00:22:14,187 --> 00:22:18,637
It's really tough for someone
to be troubled because of you.

217
00:22:19,926 --> 00:22:24,056
That's what I thought when
I decided I would help Yuuno out.

218
00:22:49,155 --> 00:22:53,575
Not just with my best, but
with everything I have...

219
00:22:55,528 --> 00:23:00,065
I decided to collect the
Jewel Seeds of my own will,

220
00:23:00,066 --> 00:23:02,676
and not just to help Yuuno out.

221
00:23:05,004 --> 00:23:08,543
So that something like this
never happens again.

222
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:26,992
Make a little wish

223
00:23:26,993 --> 00:23:31,793
Even though at times
I'll trip or get lost

224
00:23:33,066 --> 00:23:42,796
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic

225
00:23:48,148 --> 00:23:53,148
Ah, going over the sea of
cellophane and over the forests

226
00:23:55,121 --> 00:23:58,624
Passing through the silver wind

227
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:02,694
I was looking for something
neither of us had

228
00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:07,695
Ah, I was just crying
inside a diorama of a city

229
00:24:09,502 --> 00:24:14,502
Until I met that warm hand that
reached out to me that day

230
00:24:17,177 --> 00:24:22,177
Among the swaying days,
I felt a strong gaze

231
00:24:24,217 --> 00:24:29,217
Hey, I finally, finally
found the secret key

232
00:24:32,592 --> 00:24:34,259
Make a little wish

233
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:38,890
Collecting the lemon-colored
drops from the moon

234
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,200
I want to keep a light shining on
the road that you travel down

235
00:24:47,273 --> 00:24:48,774
Make a little wish

236
00:24:48,775 --> 00:24:53,605
I wonder if there is something I
can do even though I'm so little

237
00:24:54,647 --> 00:25:04,937
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic

238
00:25:12,498 --> 00:25:15,400
We all visited Suzuka's house.

239
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:19,211
She has an older sister, a maid,
and lots of cats and kitties!

240
00:25:19,873 --> 00:25:24,276
But one of the kittens seems to
be involved in some trouble?!

241
00:25:24,277 --> 00:25:27,446
And a second mage appears!

242
00:25:27,447 --> 00:25:29,581
What is her motive?

243
00:25:29,582 --> 00:25:30,215
