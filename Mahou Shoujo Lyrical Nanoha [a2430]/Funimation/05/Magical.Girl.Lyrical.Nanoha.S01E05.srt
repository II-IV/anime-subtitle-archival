1
00:00:04,786 --> 00:00:07,920
A sudden incident has befallen me,
Nanoha Takamachi,

2
00:00:07,922 --> 00:00:10,962
a girl who was supposed to be
an ordinary third-grader.

3
00:00:12,193 --> 00:00:16,503
I accepted the heart of courage,
and I gained magical powers.

4
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,759
Feelings that miss each other,
words that don't link together...

5
00:00:29,177 --> 00:00:33,807
Is fighting the only thing that I
can do to link them together?

6
00:00:36,818 --> 00:00:39,858
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha
is about to begin!

7
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:01,775
Cradling my knees in
a corner of my room

8
00:01:01,776 --> 00:01:05,144
I always shivered from uncertainty

9
00:01:05,146 --> 00:01:10,146
I was scared of learning the truth,
so I closed the door

10
00:01:12,353 --> 00:01:17,353
I found my own place within a kind lie
and I fled inside my dreams

11
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:24,861
I dye a sea of loneliness that
nobody knows of into a deep blue

12
00:01:28,102 --> 00:01:33,102
An intense feeling to
hide the loneliness

13
00:01:34,042 --> 00:01:39,042
Is continually injuring your heart

14
00:01:40,281 --> 00:01:44,985
The secret hidden deep
within the eyes

15
00:01:44,986 --> 00:01:49,523
To the truth behind the smile
that draws me in

16
00:01:49,524 --> 00:01:54,524
I will deliver a love so soft

17
00:01:54,963 --> 00:01:59,499
Right now, a warmth that might
break upon touching it

18
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,071
Parts itself from the past,
and overflows

19
00:02:04,072 --> 00:02:08,609
I'll be by your side forever

20
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:17,670
Do not be lured into
the somber shadows

21
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:32,754
I'm sure it all started
from one coincidence.

22
00:02:33,968 --> 00:02:37,871
But many coincidences
overlap each other.

23
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:41,412
I was choosing my path, being
careful not to make mistakes.

24
00:02:42,944 --> 00:02:45,904
I think that's how everyone
spends their days.

25
00:02:54,922 --> 00:02:57,142
The current days of my life may
have begun just by coincidence.

26
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:01,839
That's why I want to keep moving
ahead, without making any mistakes.

27
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:10,467
By my own will, according
to my own feelings.

28
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:19,262
Episode 5: This is a Town of Hot Water,
Uminari Hot Springs!

29
00:03:20,415 --> 00:03:21,682
Okay!

30
00:03:21,683 --> 00:03:24,523
It's vacation season all over Japan!

31
00:03:26,954 --> 00:03:31,424
Café Midoriya is always open,
but during vacation season,

32
00:03:31,426 --> 00:03:33,994
sometimes we entrust the
café to the employees

33
00:03:33,995 --> 00:03:36,805
and go off on small family vacations.

34
00:03:38,066 --> 00:03:40,816
This time, we're on a trip
with all of my friends.

35
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:49,942
My big brother, his girlfriend
Shinobu Tsukimura,

36
00:03:49,944 --> 00:03:52,814
and the maids from the Tsukimura
family, are with us as well.

37
00:03:54,182 --> 00:03:59,221
For two nights we'll be soaking
in hot springs, close to home.

38
00:04:00,088 --> 00:04:03,278
The usual Takamachi vacation plan,
to ease the fatigue of everyday life.

39
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:07,094
Look, look, so much green!

40
00:04:07,095 --> 00:04:08,128
You're so right!

41
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:09,196
It's just like the gardens in my house!

42
00:04:09,197 --> 00:04:10,464
Nanoha!
It's just like the gardens in my house!

43
00:04:10,465 --> 00:04:11,097
Nanoha!

44
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:12,031
Nanoha!

45
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:15,969
You have to unwind during
a vacation, if nowhere else!

46
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,050
I know that.

47
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:19,476
It's okay!

48
00:04:29,217 --> 00:04:32,527
That mage in black
that I met last week...

49
00:04:34,388 --> 00:04:38,227
And not having been able to find
any Jewel Seeds since then...

50
00:04:40,161 --> 00:04:42,529
I've been thinking
too much about them,

51
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,809
so Yuuno recommended that I
should take time off and rest a bit.

52
00:04:59,013 --> 00:05:00,383
So big!

53
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,121
At least for the next two days,

54
00:05:08,122 --> 00:05:10,702
I'm going to act like
all the other kids my age.

55
00:05:13,194 --> 00:05:15,654
I'm planning to play as much as I can!

56
00:05:18,065 --> 00:05:19,815
Ladies’ Bath

57
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:22,484
Sorry to keep you waiting!
Shall we go?

58
00:05:26,107 --> 00:05:29,209
Have you ever soaked
in a hot spring, Yuuno?

59
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,960
Uh... Well... I've been to
a public bath before, but...

60
00:05:36,217 --> 00:05:38,056
Hot springs are wonderful!

61
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,930
Really?

62
00:05:55,736 --> 00:05:57,137
Nanoha!

63
00:05:57,138 --> 00:05:58,397
I think, after all...

64
00:06:01,108 --> 00:06:04,211
I think I'll go to the men's bath
with Kyouya and Shiro.

65
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:07,692
It's okay! Let's go in together!

66
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:16,656
Fantastic!

67
00:06:16,657 --> 00:06:18,996
Amazing! It's so spacious!

68
00:06:20,862 --> 00:06:22,896
It is amazing!

69
00:06:22,897 --> 00:06:24,507
Really!

70
00:06:29,237 --> 00:06:32,105
Sis, let me wash your back!

71
00:06:32,106 --> 00:06:34,174
Thank you, Suzuka.

72
00:06:34,175 --> 00:06:35,675
Then I will too!

73
00:06:35,676 --> 00:06:36,606
Thanks.

74
00:06:40,147 --> 00:06:42,837
Then I'll give you a wash!

75
00:06:45,853 --> 00:06:47,487
No need to worry!

76
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:49,358
I'm really good at washing things!

77
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:03,409
Holidays like this are so nice.

78
00:07:04,272 --> 00:07:06,022
Yeah, you're right.

79
00:07:06,908 --> 00:07:11,144
o Tt e L ungsters

80
00:07:11,145 --> 00:07:13,955
And our kids are all so full of energy.

81
00:07:17,285 --> 00:07:19,425
And you too.

82
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:23,649
Yes, I guess I am.

83
00:07:28,162 --> 00:07:30,472
It took quite a while.

84
00:07:33,901 --> 00:07:37,361
I'm sure I won't be worrying you
or our kids anymore, Momoko.

85
00:07:38,606 --> 00:07:43,276
Right, from now on, Midoriya's
owner is what I'll always be.

86
00:07:43,277 --> 00:07:46,116
Yes. Thank you, honey.

87
00:08:01,262 --> 00:08:02,192
Here you go.

88
00:08:03,264 --> 00:08:04,364
Thanks.

89
00:08:04,365 --> 00:08:09,365
But Noel, you're not on duty today,
so you can relax, you know?

90
00:08:09,403 --> 00:08:12,183
Right, I am relaxing right now!

91
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:20,747
Then, big sister, Miss Shinobu,
we're going to go on ahead!

92
00:08:20,748 --> 00:08:22,015
Okay!

93
00:08:22,016 --> 00:08:26,720
I'm going to go roam around the inn
a bit with Nanoha and the others!

94
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:28,941
Okay. See you later.

95
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,431
Now, let's go, Yuuno!

96
00:08:36,664 --> 00:08:38,563
That really felt good!

97
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,534
Since we've washed off the sweat,
shall we play some ping-pong?

98
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:45,238
Ping-pong?

99
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:48,229
Oh, I wanted to go see
what souvenirs they had.

100
00:08:49,643 --> 00:08:51,311
What should we do?

101
00:08:51,312 --> 00:08:52,712
Which should we do first?

102
00:08:52,713 --> 00:08:54,022
Why not play
paper-rock-scissors to decide?

103
00:08:57,752 --> 00:09:00,061
Hi, kiddies!

104
00:09:08,996 --> 00:09:12,456
Are you the one that did the
you-know-what to my girl?

105
00:09:14,935 --> 00:09:17,834
You don't look too smart or strong.

106
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:20,999
You look like an ordinary kid.

107
00:09:24,612 --> 00:09:27,013
Nanoha, do you know her?

108
00:09:27,014 --> 00:09:28,314
No.

109
00:09:28,315 --> 00:09:32,852
It seems she doesn't know you.
Who are you?!

110
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:33,902
Uh-huh...

111
00:09:51,305 --> 00:09:52,972
Sorry, sorry!

112
00:09:52,973 --> 00:09:54,974
I guess I was thinking
of the wrong person.

113
00:09:54,975 --> 00:09:57,495
You really look like a girl I know.

114
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:01,649
Oh, I see, that's what it was.

115
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:07,459
That's such a cute ferret!

116
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:09,622
Yes!

117
00:10:09,623 --> 00:10:12,023
There, there! Pet, pet!

118
00:10:15,396 --> 00:10:18,055
For now, I'm just going to say hello.

119
00:10:23,003 --> 00:10:24,938
Let me warn you.

120
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:27,978
Kids should behave themselves
and play at home!

121
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:31,729
If you're being a bad girl,
you'll get bitten, got that?

122
00:10:37,017 --> 00:10:40,327
Well then, I think I'll
go take another bath!

123
00:10:47,862 --> 00:10:48,732
Nanoha...

124
00:10:50,164 --> 00:10:51,184
Yeah.

125
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:54,237
Nanoha...

126
00:10:55,369 --> 00:10:56,039
Yeah?

127
00:10:56,604 --> 00:10:58,771
What was that?

128
00:10:58,772 --> 00:11:01,474
Well... That was a really
strange person.

129
00:11:01,475 --> 00:11:04,135
Is she drunk this early in the day?!

130
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:06,446
She's creepy!

131
00:11:06,447 --> 00:11:06,679
Arisa...
She's creepy!

132
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,380
Arisa...

133
00:11:07,381 --> 00:11:09,816
Now, now, this is a place to relax,

134
00:11:09,817 --> 00:11:11,584
so there's all sorts of people here!

135
00:11:11,585 --> 00:11:15,335
But you should know how
to be modest! Modesty, I say!

136
00:11:28,402 --> 00:11:31,070
Oh, hello, Fate?

137
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:32,441
This is Aruf.

138
00:11:46,187 --> 00:11:48,997
I went and took a look
at that girl in white.

139
00:11:50,224 --> 00:11:52,244
I see. How was she?

140
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:55,791
Well, she's not much of anything.

141
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:58,498
She's no match for you, Fate.

142
00:11:58,499 --> 00:12:02,035
I see. I've gotten a small lead too.

143
00:12:02,036 --> 00:12:05,505
I've determined the general
location of the next Jewel Seed.

144
00:12:05,506 --> 00:12:07,315
I think we'll be able
to capture it tonight.

145
00:12:08,442 --> 00:12:10,476
Nice going, Fate!

146
00:12:10,477 --> 00:12:12,757
Nothing less from my master!

147
00:12:14,548 --> 00:12:15,718
Thanks, Aruf.

148
00:12:16,617 --> 00:12:18,484
Let's meet up again tonight.

149
00:12:18,485 --> 00:12:19,415
Sure!

150
00:12:22,823 --> 00:12:24,783
Relax, relax!

151
00:12:28,729 --> 00:12:29,579
Whoops.

152
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:39,939
Oh, no!

153
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,870
You think this will be fine?

154
00:12:48,882 --> 00:12:50,811
And they lived happily ever after.

155
00:12:59,827 --> 00:13:03,630
Oh, Falin. Are all the kids
asleep already?

156
00:13:03,631 --> 00:13:06,151
Yes, Mrs. Momoko.
They're sound asleep.

157
00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:17,610
Thank you, Falin.

158
00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:20,420
No, it's something I'm doing
because I want to.

159
00:13:34,995 --> 00:13:37,215
Yuuno, are you awake?

160
00:13:38,032 --> 00:13:38,962
Yeah.

161
00:13:42,603 --> 00:13:43,903
That woman from this afternoon...

162
00:13:43,904 --> 00:13:46,572
Does she have something to do
with that girl from the other day?

163
00:13:46,573 --> 00:13:47,674
Probably.

164
00:13:47,675 --> 00:13:51,577
Are things going to end up like
what happened the other day?

165
00:13:51,578 --> 00:13:52,507
Probably...

166
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:59,952
Nanoha, you know, I've thought
about it since that day.

167
00:13:59,953 --> 00:14:01,621
And I think, after all, I should...

168
00:14:01,622 --> 00:14:03,222
Stop!

169
00:14:03,223 --> 00:14:05,803
If you finish that sentence,
I'll get mad!

170
00:14:09,063 --> 00:14:12,065
You were going to say, "I should
do the rest from here by myself."

171
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:16,516
"I can't get you involved in this
any further, Nanoha," right?

172
00:14:17,738 --> 00:14:18,558
Yeah.

173
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,577
Collecting the Jewel Seeds...

174
00:14:24,578 --> 00:14:27,380
At first I was just
helping you out, Yuuno.

175
00:14:27,381 --> 00:14:29,716
But now it's different.

176
00:14:29,717 --> 00:14:33,287
It's something that I'm doing
because I want to do it.

177
00:14:38,692 --> 00:14:42,061
If you tell me you want to leave
me behind and do it by yourself,

178
00:14:42,062 --> 00:14:43,202
I'll get mad at you.

179
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:45,518
Yeah.

180
00:14:48,802 --> 00:14:51,070
Let's get some sleep.

181
00:14:51,071 --> 00:14:54,141
There might be something
going on again tonight.

182
00:14:54,842 --> 00:14:55,802
Yeah...

183
00:15:41,922 --> 00:15:42,922
Bingo!

184
00:15:42,923 --> 00:15:45,413
I've found it, Fate!

185
00:15:49,163 --> 00:15:50,296
Nanoha...

186
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:53,065
It's all right! Let's hurry, Yuuno!

187
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:55,146
Raging Heart, please!

188
00:15:57,704 --> 00:15:59,954
Stand by ready. Set up.

189
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,156
Wow, this is an amazing one!

190
00:16:17,157 --> 00:16:20,026
Is this what you call the power
of the Lost Logia?

191
00:16:20,027 --> 00:16:24,096
Though its condition is very
incomplete and unstable, yes.

192
00:16:24,097 --> 00:16:27,637
Why does your mom want
something like that, anyway?

193
00:16:28,802 --> 00:16:29,936
Who knows?

194
00:16:29,937 --> 00:16:33,339
I have no idea, but the
reason doesn't matter.

195
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,440
Mother wants them,
so I need to obtain them.

196
00:16:37,978 --> 00:16:39,588
Bardiche, wake up.

197
00:16:41,014 --> 00:16:42,034
Yes, sir.

198
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:53,108
Sealing form, set up.

199
00:17:23,857 --> 00:17:27,126
I'm going to seal it. Aruf, back me up.

200
00:17:27,127 --> 00:17:28,206
Sure thing.

201
00:17:32,232 --> 00:17:33,312
That's...

202
00:17:37,905 --> 00:17:38,835
That's two.

203
00:17:44,845 --> 00:17:47,685
Oh, my, my, my!

204
00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:52,485
Didn't I tell you that
kids should behave?

205
00:17:52,486 --> 00:17:54,976
What are you going to do
with that Jewel Seed?!

206
00:17:55,556 --> 00:17:57,924
It's a dangerous item!

207
00:17:57,925 --> 00:17:59,458
Who knows?

208
00:17:59,459 --> 00:18:02,261
I don't see any reason to answer that.

209
00:18:02,262 --> 00:18:06,299
Besides, I was nice
and told you, right?

210
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,340
That if you didn't behave,
you'll get bitten!

211
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,115
Just as I thought!
She's that girl's familiar!

212
00:18:23,116 --> 00:18:24,584
A familiar?

213
00:18:24,585 --> 00:18:29,221
That's right, I'm a magical
lifeform that this girl created.

214
00:18:29,222 --> 00:18:31,824
In return for living on through
the creator's magical powers,

215
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:34,695
I use my life and all my
power to protect her!

216
00:18:35,963 --> 00:18:38,513
Go home ahead of me.
I'll catch up to you soon.

217
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,620
Don't be reckless.

218
00:18:42,102 --> 00:18:43,242
Okay!

219
00:18:50,844 --> 00:18:52,864
Nanoha, please go after the girl!

220
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,750
You think I'd allow that to happen?

221
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,100
I'll make sure it happens!

222
00:19:01,555 --> 00:19:03,775
Transportation magic?! Not good!

223
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:17,845
A barrier, and a forced transfer spell...

224
00:19:18,905 --> 00:19:20,365
You have a good familiar with you.

225
00:19:21,942 --> 00:19:25,044
Yuuno isn't what you call a familiar!

226
00:19:25,045 --> 00:19:26,825
He's a dear friend of mine!

227
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,950
Well, what are you going to do?

228
00:19:35,656 --> 00:19:39,025
Isn't there a way that we can
somehow talk this out?

229
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,830
I must collect the shards of the
Lost Logia, the Jewel Seeds.

230
00:19:45,932 --> 00:19:49,101
And if you have the
same objective as I do,

231
00:19:49,102 --> 00:19:53,539
then we are enemies, who must fight
over the Jewel Seeds as a prize.

232
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,674
That's why!

233
00:19:54,675 --> 00:19:57,943
So that we don't quickly
jump to that conclusion,

234
00:19:57,944 --> 00:20:00,664
I think we need to talk
everything out first!

235
00:20:01,948 --> 00:20:03,058
Just talking it out...

236
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,290
I'm sure mere words
won't change anything.

237
00:20:08,622 --> 00:20:09,882
You wouldn't get it!

238
00:20:14,494 --> 00:20:15,783
Flier Fin.

239
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:22,731
But that doesn't mean that...

240
00:20:23,236 --> 00:20:24,537
Let's make a bet.

241
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:26,968
We'll each stake one Jewel Seed.

242
00:20:27,974 --> 00:20:29,783
Photon Lancer, get set.

243
00:20:41,154 --> 00:20:43,234
Don't just scurry and sneak away!

244
00:20:44,224 --> 00:20:46,392
What is a mage powerful enough

245
00:20:46,393 --> 00:20:48,233
to create a familiar
doing in this world?!

246
00:20:49,262 --> 00:20:53,432
And what does she know about the
Jewel Seeds... the Lost Logia?!

247
00:20:53,433 --> 00:20:54,743
Stop babbling!

248
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,091
Thunder Smasher.

249
00:21:06,546 --> 00:21:07,976
Divine Buster.

250
00:21:14,087 --> 00:21:16,255
Please, Raging Heart!

251
00:21:16,256 --> 00:21:17,246
All right.

252
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,850
Nanoha is powerful!

253
00:21:38,178 --> 00:21:40,078
But she's too soft.

254
00:21:43,116 --> 00:21:44,376
Scythe Slash.

255
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:46,819
Nanoha!

256
00:22:09,576 --> 00:22:10,596
Put out.

257
00:22:13,446 --> 00:22:16,182
Raging Heart, what are you doing?!

258
00:22:16,183 --> 00:22:18,873
I'm sure it's a good one that
cares greatly for its master.

259
00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:33,989
Let's go home, Aruf.

260
00:22:41,074 --> 00:22:43,509
Nothing less from my master!

261
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,730
See you later, kiddo!

262
00:22:47,848 --> 00:22:48,697
Wait!

263
00:22:50,684 --> 00:22:53,754
If it's at all possible,
never appear before us again.

264
00:22:54,554 --> 00:22:58,244
If there's a next time, I might
not be able to stop myself.

265
00:22:59,392 --> 00:23:00,382
Your name...

266
00:23:01,361 --> 00:23:02,671
What is your name?

267
00:23:04,231 --> 00:23:05,081
Fate.

268
00:23:05,532 --> 00:23:07,022
Fate Testarossa.

269
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,070
Um... I'm...

270
00:23:13,173 --> 00:23:14,223
Bye-bye!

271
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:26,652
Make a little wish

272
00:23:26,653 --> 00:23:31,453
Even though at times
I'll trip or get lost

273
00:23:32,592 --> 00:23:42,442
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic

274
00:23:47,807 --> 00:23:52,807
Ah, going over the sea of
cellophane and over the forests

275
00:23:54,614 --> 00:23:58,284
Passing through the silver wind

276
00:23:58,285 --> 00:24:02,354
I was looking for something
neither of us had

277
00:24:02,355 --> 00:24:07,355
Ah, I was just crying
inside a diorama of a city

278
00:24:09,162 --> 00:24:14,162
Until I met that warm hand that
reached out to me that day

279
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:21,670
Among the swaying days,
I felt a strong gaze

280
00:24:23,877 --> 00:24:28,877
Hey, I finally, finally
found the secret key

281
00:24:32,252 --> 00:24:33,919
Make a little wish

282
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,550
Collecting the lemon-colored
drops from the moon

283
00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:44,859
I want to keep a light shining on
the road that you travel down

284
00:24:46,933 --> 00:24:48,434
Make a little wish

285
00:24:48,435 --> 00:24:53,264
I wonder if there is something I
can do even though I'm so little

286
00:24:54,274 --> 00:25:04,734
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic

287
00:25:13,026 --> 00:25:15,594
Nanoha is hiding something from us.

288
00:25:15,595 --> 00:25:17,262
We can't do anything about that.

289
00:25:17,263 --> 00:25:20,499
There are things that you can't
tell even your friends about.

290
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,268
The events of the past
are coming to light.

291
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:25,270
What are the destinies
of the two magical girls

292
00:25:25,271 --> 00:25:27,806
that meet one another once again?!
