1
00:00:03,942 --> 00:00:07,877
It was a small incident that happened
to me, Nanoha Takamachi,

2
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:10,809
a girl who was supposed to be
an ordinary third-grader.

3
00:00:11,683 --> 00:00:15,753
I accepted the heart of courage,
and I gained magical powers.

4
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:19,256
We met each other in the storm.

5
00:00:19,257 --> 00:00:21,692
Feelings that cannot
touch one another.

6
00:00:21,693 --> 00:00:23,961
But even if the words don't reach,

7
00:00:23,962 --> 00:00:27,332
I felt that I wanted to share
the wishes, and the sadness.

8
00:00:28,734 --> 00:00:30,935
There is a feeling I want
to deliver to your heart,

9
00:00:30,936 --> 00:00:34,275
to the only you in this world.

10
00:00:36,408 --> 00:00:39,838
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha
is about to begin!

11
00:00:57,662 --> 00:01:01,632
Cradling my knees in
a corner of my room

12
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:04,968
I always shivered from uncertainty

13
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,970
I was scared of learning the truth,
so I closed the door

14
00:01:12,377 --> 00:01:17,377
I found my own place within a kind lie
and I fled inside my dreams

15
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:24,551
I dye a sea of loneliness that
nobody knows of into a deep blue

16
00:01:27,926 --> 00:01:32,926
An intense feeling to
hide the loneliness

17
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:38,899
Is continually injuring your heart

18
00:01:40,305 --> 00:01:44,842
The secret hidden deep
within the eyes

19
00:01:44,843 --> 00:01:49,380
To the truth behind the smile
that draws me in

20
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:54,381
I will deliver a love so soft

21
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,323
Right now, a warmth that might
break upon touching it

22
00:01:59,324 --> 00:02:03,928
Parts itself from the past,
and overflows

23
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:08,466
I'll be by your side forever

24
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:17,527
Do not be lured into
the somber shadows

25
00:02:34,426 --> 00:02:35,856
And so...

26
00:02:36,962 --> 00:02:41,531
As of 00:00 today, the entire crew's
mission will be changed

27
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:44,869
to the search for and retrieval of
the Lost Logia, the Jewel Seeds.

28
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,571
Now, concerning this case,
we have made a special exception,

29
00:02:47,572 --> 00:02:50,374
and welcome the discoverer
of the Lost Logia,

30
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,215
a barrier mage...

31
00:02:52,978 --> 00:02:55,079
Yes. I'm Yuuno Scrya.

32
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,360
And helping out his efforts,
a mage from the local world...

33
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:02,052
I'm Nanoha Takamachi!

34
00:03:02,053 --> 00:03:04,655
These two members will be
treated as temporary staff

35
00:03:04,656 --> 00:03:06,457
to help with the mission.

36
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,128
Nice to meet you all!

37
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:22,342
Episode 9:
The Decisive Battle Above the Ocean

38
00:03:28,647 --> 00:03:32,917
We will determine the locations
of the Jewel Seeds.

39
00:03:32,918 --> 00:03:35,619
When we find them, we'll
have you head to the site.

40
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,921
Okay!

41
00:03:36,922 --> 00:03:38,589
Captain, your tea.

42
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,580
Thank you.

43
00:03:59,077 --> 00:04:00,978
By the way, Nanoha,

44
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:02,746
is your school all right with this?

45
00:04:02,747 --> 00:04:04,114
Yes.

46
00:04:04,115 --> 00:04:07,075
I already gave an explanation
to my family and friends.

47
00:04:08,153 --> 00:04:10,487
And so, due to family circumstances,

48
00:04:10,488 --> 00:04:14,692
Miss Takamachi will be absent
from school for a few days.

49
00:04:14,693 --> 00:04:19,692
But she's not out due to illness,
injury, or personal tragedy,

50
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:22,752
so there's no need to worry.

51
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:26,237
While Miss Takamachi is absent,

52
00:04:26,238 --> 00:04:27,805
note-taking and
collecting hand-outs...

53
00:04:27,806 --> 00:04:29,445
Yes, I'll do it!

54
00:04:31,476 --> 00:04:34,011
Miss Arisa, I'll leave it to you.

55
00:04:34,012 --> 00:04:35,032
Okay!

56
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:40,050
Now, let's start today's homeroom!

57
00:04:40,051 --> 00:04:41,041
Rise!

58
00:04:42,854 --> 00:04:43,153
Bow!

59
00:04:43,154 --> 00:04:43,854
Nanoha...
Bow!

60
00:04:43,855 --> 00:04:44,555
Nanoha...

61
00:04:44,556 --> 00:04:45,823
I wonder if she's still cheerful?

62
00:04:45,824 --> 00:04:46,964
Be seated!

63
00:04:57,569 --> 00:04:58,569
Caught it!

64
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,303
Nanoha!

65
00:04:59,304 --> 00:05:00,323
Okay!

66
00:05:02,507 --> 00:05:03,907
Sealing Mode, set up.

67
00:05:12,217 --> 00:05:13,736
Stand by ready.

68
00:05:14,886 --> 00:05:17,121
Lyrical, magical...

69
00:05:17,122 --> 00:05:20,190
Jewel Seed, Serial VIII,

70
00:05:20,191 --> 00:05:21,258
seal!

71
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:22,459
Sealing.

72
00:05:36,675 --> 00:05:37,965
Receipt No. VIII.

73
00:05:40,812 --> 00:05:42,179
Situation has been settled.

74
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,082
Jewel Seed No. VIII
has been safely captured.

75
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,685
Good job, Nanoha, Yuuno.

76
00:05:47,686 --> 00:05:48,786
Yeah!

77
00:05:48,787 --> 00:05:50,777
I'll make a gate. Wait there.

78
00:05:51,923 --> 00:05:54,558
Both of them are rather excellent.

79
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,429
At this rate, I might
want to keep them!

80
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:04,935
This girl in black was named Fate?

81
00:06:04,936 --> 00:06:06,637
Fate Testarossa.

82
00:06:06,638 --> 00:06:09,673
The same family name as
the great mage of yore.

83
00:06:09,674 --> 00:06:11,675
Oh... is that so?

84
00:06:11,676 --> 00:06:13,811
It's a story from a long time ago.

85
00:06:13,812 --> 00:06:17,648
In the central city of Midchilda,
during a magical experiment,

86
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:22,319
a great mage created dimensional
interference, and was banished.

87
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,054
And this has something
to do with her?

88
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:26,455
Who knows? It might
not be her real name.

89
00:06:30,228 --> 00:06:32,629
It's no good after all. I can't find her.

90
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,580
Fate must be using a very
efficient jamming barrier.

91
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:39,803
The canine familiar...

92
00:06:39,804 --> 00:06:42,606
Most likely, she's
supporting her master.

93
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:45,142
Thanks to that, two of the
Jewel Seeds that we've found

94
00:06:45,143 --> 00:06:47,411
have been taken by them already.

95
00:06:47,412 --> 00:06:49,913
Do a thorough search to
make up for the loss.

96
00:06:49,914 --> 00:06:51,849
We're counting on you.

97
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:52,930
Got it.

98
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,657
Fate isn't showing up.

99
00:07:00,658 --> 00:07:04,638
Yeah. She seems to be collecting
different Jewel Seeds.

100
00:07:05,997 --> 00:07:07,047
Yeah...

101
00:07:17,776 --> 00:07:20,466
It's no good, Fate. Looks like a dud.

102
00:07:21,746 --> 00:07:22,616
I see.

103
00:07:23,314 --> 00:07:26,784
After all, it's pretty hard
to search in hiding,

104
00:07:26,785 --> 00:07:28,835
so that they can't find us.

105
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:32,501
But we should do our best
for just a little longer.

106
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:46,200
And, on the tenth day after
we boarded the Arthra...

107
00:07:50,942 --> 00:07:55,542
We've obtained three Jewel Seeds,
VIII, IX, and XII.

108
00:07:56,948 --> 00:08:01,988
And Fate and Aruf found themselves
two more, serials II and V.

109
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,488
Another six...

110
00:08:12,764 --> 00:08:16,733
The last six... We haven't
seen them around yet.

111
00:08:16,734 --> 00:08:19,837
We have expanded the search area
to cover more than just land.

112
00:08:19,838 --> 00:08:22,873
Since we are near an ocean,
they might have sunk into it.

113
00:08:22,874 --> 00:08:26,444
Amy is searching for them,
along with that girl in black.

114
00:08:27,712 --> 00:08:28,582
I see.

115
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:39,095
We came up empty-handed
again today.

116
00:08:40,725 --> 00:08:43,927
It might take a long time
to find them all.

117
00:08:43,928 --> 00:08:45,768
Nanoha, I'm sorry.

118
00:08:46,764 --> 00:08:48,198
Aren't you lonely?

119
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:50,901
Not really. I'm not lonely at all.

120
00:08:50,902 --> 00:08:52,870
I'm here with you, Yuuno.

121
00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:55,272
I'm more or less okay
being by myself too.

122
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:58,742
When I was little, I was all alone a lot.

123
00:08:58,743 --> 00:09:01,879
Back when I was really little,

124
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,481
Dad got into a huge accident at work,

125
00:09:04,482 --> 00:09:07,411
and for a while, he couldn't
move out of bed.

126
00:09:10,221 --> 00:09:12,523
He had just opened up the cafÃ©,

127
00:09:12,524 --> 00:09:14,758
so it wasn't as popular
as it is today, either.

128
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:17,889
So Mom and big brother
were always really busy.

129
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:22,430
Big sister was always
taking care of Dad.

130
00:09:23,801 --> 00:09:28,251
So until recently, I was all alone
at my house a lot.

131
00:09:33,945 --> 00:09:35,585
That's why I'm kind of used to it.

132
00:09:36,381 --> 00:09:37,371
I see.

133
00:09:38,116 --> 00:09:43,116
Come to think of it, I don't know
much about your family, Yuuno.

134
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:46,790
Yeah, I was all alone to begin with.

135
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:47,824
Really?

136
00:09:47,825 --> 00:09:49,893
I didn't have parents,

137
00:09:49,894 --> 00:09:52,396
but everyone in the clan
took care of me.

138
00:09:52,397 --> 00:09:56,533
So everyone in the
Scrya clan is my family.

139
00:09:56,534 --> 00:09:57,614
I see...

140
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:06,810
Yuuno, when everything
is taken care of,

141
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:09,813
let's talk a lot more
about all sorts of things.

142
00:10:09,814 --> 00:10:12,093
Yeah, when everything
is taken care of.

143
00:10:24,996 --> 00:10:26,964
When everything is taken care of...

144
00:10:26,965 --> 00:10:29,515
When the Jewel Seed
problem is solved...

145
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:33,208
Right... I'm sure that we...

146
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:37,841
Emergency!

147
00:10:37,842 --> 00:10:39,209
A large magical reaction
has been spotted

148
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,110
above the ocean within
the search area!

149
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:46,112
What are those kids doing?!

150
00:11:04,435 --> 00:11:07,045
Alcus Curtas Agias...

151
00:11:08,006 --> 00:11:11,696
Swift glimmering thunder,
fall under my guidance now.

152
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:15,261
Paruer Zaruer Brouzel...

153
00:11:25,556 --> 00:11:28,425
The Jewel Seeds are
probably under the ocean.

154
00:11:28,426 --> 00:11:31,428
So your plan to pour a stream of
electrical magic into the ocean,

155
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:34,564
to force an execution to
determine their location,

156
00:11:34,565 --> 00:11:36,633
isn't a mistake...

157
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:38,714
But Fate!

158
00:11:39,671 --> 00:11:42,706
To pound is lightning,
to echo is thunder.

159
00:11:42,707 --> 00:11:44,727
Alcus Curtas Agias...

160
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:21,745
Found them...

161
00:12:21,746 --> 00:12:23,006
The last six!

162
00:12:23,948 --> 00:12:28,552
Pouring in this much magic, and
sealing them all on top of that...

163
00:12:28,553 --> 00:12:30,687
Even with Fate's magical powers,

164
00:12:30,688 --> 00:12:32,088
we have to be past the limit!

165
00:12:33,357 --> 00:12:36,626
Aruf, please set up a spatial barrier
and back me up.

166
00:12:36,627 --> 00:12:38,406
Sure, leave it to me!

167
00:12:40,998 --> 00:12:44,000
So no matter who comes,
no matter what happens,

168
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:45,731
I'll protect her for sure!

169
00:12:53,044 --> 00:12:55,264
Let's go, Bardiche. We'll do our best.

170
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:25,475
What's she's doing is
so unreasonable, it's disgusting.

171
00:13:25,476 --> 00:13:27,144
It's quite reckless.

172
00:13:27,145 --> 00:13:28,845
She's sure to ruin herself doing that.

173
00:13:29,347 --> 00:13:32,776
It's beyond the limits of how much
magical power one person can emit!

174
00:13:35,153 --> 00:13:36,003
Fate!

175
00:13:38,523 --> 00:13:40,713
I'llhurry over to the site!

176
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:43,126
That won't be necessary.

177
00:13:43,127 --> 00:13:44,936
Leave her alone, and
she will ruin herself.

178
00:13:50,134 --> 00:13:52,169
Even if she doesn't ruin herself,

179
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,138
we can smite her when
all her power has been spent.

180
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:56,039
But...

181
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,175
We should prepare
to capture her now.

182
00:13:58,176 --> 00:13:59,026
Roger.

183
00:14:07,118 --> 00:14:08,818
Fate! Fate!

184
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:27,103
We must always make the
best choice for the situation.

185
00:14:27,104 --> 00:14:30,807
Even if it seems very cruel to you,
that's the reality.

186
00:14:30,808 --> 00:14:31,948
But...

187
00:14:37,415 --> 00:14:38,285
Go.

188
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:41,454
Nanoha, go.

189
00:14:44,755 --> 00:14:47,791
I'll open the gate, so go and get her...

190
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:49,426
But Yuuno!

191
00:14:49,427 --> 00:14:52,796
The fact that I want to talk to Fate

192
00:14:52,797 --> 00:14:54,227
has nothing to do with you!

193
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:57,400
It may have nothing to do with me.

194
00:14:57,401 --> 00:15:02,138
But I want to be of help to you,
if you're in trouble.

195
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,509
Just like how you were for me.

196
00:15:13,284 --> 00:15:14,364
You're...

197
00:15:30,301 --> 00:15:31,434
I'm sorry.

198
00:15:31,435 --> 00:15:33,536
Nanoha Takamachi is going
to disobey orders,

199
00:15:33,537 --> 00:15:35,057
and take action on her own!

200
00:15:36,574 --> 00:15:38,883
Transport to a location
within that girl's barrier!

201
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,457
Let's go, Raising Heart!

202
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,294
Winds to the sky,
stars to the heavens.

203
00:15:57,295 --> 00:15:59,396
Glimmering light to these arms...

204
00:15:59,397 --> 00:16:01,631
And the unyielding soul to this heart!

205
00:16:01,632 --> 00:16:05,268
Raising Heart, set up!

206
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:06,579
Stand by ready.

207
00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:24,833
Don't get in Fate's way!

208
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:32,951
You're wrong! We're not here
to fight against you!

209
00:16:34,231 --> 00:16:35,341
Yuuno?!

210
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:38,554
That's absurd!
What are you two doing?!

211
00:16:39,503 --> 00:16:43,239
I'm sorry. I'll apologize properly
later for disobeying orders.

212
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,970
But I can't leave her alone!

213
00:16:45,977 --> 00:16:48,812
I'm sure that she's all on her own!

214
00:16:48,813 --> 00:16:50,613
It's lonely, being all on your own.

215
00:16:50,614 --> 00:16:52,424
I understand that, even just a tiny bit!

216
00:16:54,452 --> 00:16:56,653
We have to stop the Jewel Seeds first,

217
00:16:56,654 --> 00:16:58,054
or we'll be in a bad situation!

218
00:17:03,828 --> 00:17:06,818
So for now, support their sealing.

219
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:19,149
Fate!

220
00:17:20,277 --> 00:17:23,146
Help me. Let's stop the Jewel Seeds.

221
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:36,099
Power charge.

222
00:17:37,294 --> 00:17:39,024
Supply complete.

223
00:17:43,467 --> 00:17:45,307
We'll split it evenly into halves!

224
00:18:01,986 --> 00:18:04,320
Yuuno and Aruf are stopping it for us.

225
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:06,021
So now's our chance!

226
00:18:07,491 --> 00:18:10,527
When I say ready,
let's both seal it in one shot!

227
00:18:10,528 --> 00:18:11,668
Shooting Mode.

228
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,911
When I was all alone,
and feeling lonely,

229
00:18:27,912 --> 00:18:30,080
the one thing that I wanted
people to do most

230
00:18:30,081 --> 00:18:32,482
wasn't to ask me if I was all right,

231
00:18:32,483 --> 00:18:34,473
or to be nice to me.

232
00:18:42,993 --> 00:18:44,832
Sealing Form, set up.

233
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,490
Bardiche?

234
00:18:57,575 --> 00:19:00,076
Divine Buster, full power.

235
00:19:00,077 --> 00:19:01,377
You can do it, right?

236
00:19:01,378 --> 00:19:03,187
All right, my master.

237
00:19:20,397 --> 00:19:21,627
Ready, set...

238
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:24,777
Thunder...

239
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:30,219
Divine...

240
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:36,679
Rage!

241
00:19:42,386 --> 00:19:43,876
Buster!

242
00:20:08,145 --> 00:20:11,447
The sealing of all six Jewel Seeds
has been confirmed.

243
00:20:11,448 --> 00:20:13,438
What an irresponsible action.

244
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:16,649
But it's still amazing!

245
00:20:30,568 --> 00:20:32,437
To share the same feelings...

246
00:20:33,504 --> 00:20:37,254
To split the loneliness,
the sadness in half...

247
00:20:42,713 --> 00:20:45,173
So that's it. I finally understand.

248
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,110
I want to share with her.

249
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:56,698
I want to be friends with you.

250
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:13,843
Dimensional interference?!

251
00:21:13,844 --> 00:21:16,179
A magical attack is
headed towards our ship

252
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,648
and the combat air zone
from another dimension!

253
00:21:18,649 --> 00:21:19,698
Impact in six!

254
00:21:33,697 --> 00:21:34,776
Mother?!

255
00:21:40,504 --> 00:21:41,353
Fate?!

256
00:21:54,518 --> 00:21:55,808
Don't get...

257
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,560
..in our way!

258
00:22:04,161 --> 00:22:05,531
There's only three?!

259
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,152
They're escaping! Capture them!

260
00:22:29,153 --> 00:22:30,019
It's no good!

261
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,240
The lightning strike has stopped
the flincher from functioning!

262
00:22:46,637 --> 00:22:48,971
Twenty-five seconds until
all functions are restored!

263
00:22:48,972 --> 00:22:50,112
We can't keep up with them!

264
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:53,876
Put up anti-magic defense until
all functions have been restored.

265
00:22:53,877 --> 00:22:55,044
Prepare for the next attack!

266
00:22:55,045 --> 00:22:56,355
Yes, ma'am!

267
00:22:57,614 --> 00:22:58,748
And also,

268
00:22:58,749 --> 00:23:01,769
we will retrieve Nanoha,
Yuuno, and Chrono.

269
00:23:25,576 --> 00:23:26,709
Make a little wish

270
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:31,370
Even though at times
I'll trip or get lost

271
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:42,349
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic

272
00:23:47,698 --> 00:23:52,698
Ah, going over the sea of cellophane
and over the forests

273
00:23:54,671 --> 00:23:58,207
Passing through the silver wind

274
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:02,245
I was looking for something
neither of us had

275
00:24:02,246 --> 00:24:07,246
Ah, I was just crying inside
a diorama of a city

276
00:24:09,052 --> 00:24:14,052
Until I met that warm hand that
reached out to me that day

277
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,760
Among the swaying days,
I felt a strong gaze

278
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:28,767
Hey, I finally, finally
found the secret key

279
00:24:32,142 --> 00:24:33,810
Make a little wish

280
00:24:33,811 --> 00:24:38,441
Collecting the lemon-colored
drops from the moon

281
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:44,750
I want to keep a light shining
on the road that you travel down

282
00:24:46,824 --> 00:24:48,357
Make a little wish

283
00:24:48,358 --> 00:24:53,158
I wonder if there is something
I can do even though I'm so little

284
00:24:54,198 --> 00:25:04,488
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic

285
00:25:14,451 --> 00:25:16,919
The situation is reaching its final turn!

286
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,188
Each hold their own
feelings in their heart,

287
00:25:19,189 --> 00:25:21,824
in order to withstand the final storm.

288
00:25:21,825 --> 00:25:24,755
And I also tell Fate how I really feel.

289
