1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,872
It was a small incident that happened
to me, Nanoha Takamachi,

2
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:09,774
a girl who was supposed to be
an ordinary third-grader.

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:14,790
I believed in the heart of courage,
and I gained magical powers.

4
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:19,953
Even if your feelings break,
even if your wishes are far away,

5
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:22,944
don't forget the kindness that
has always been at your side.

6
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,993
There has been a heart
that supported you,

7
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:29,514
and there is someone that
is waiting for you to smile.

8
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:34,125
With true feelings, make a wish.

9
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,529
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha
is about to begin!

10
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:00,526
Cradling my knees in
a corner of my room

11
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:04,062
I always shivered from uncertainty

12
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:09,064
I was scared of learning the truth,
so I closed the door

13
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:16,105
I found my own place within a kind lie
and I fled inside my dreams

14
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:23,445
I dye a sea of loneliness that
nobody knows of into a deep blue

15
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:32,021
An intense feeling to
hide the loneliness

16
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,960
Is continually injuring your heart

17
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:43,735
The secret hidden deep
within the eyes

18
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:48,274
To the truth behind the smile
that draws me in

19
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:53,275
I will deliver a love so soft

20
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:58,250
Right now, a warmth that might
break upon touching it

21
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:02,988
Parts itself from the past,
and overflows

22
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,360
I'll be by your side forever

23
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:16,421
Do not be lured into
the somber shadows

24
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:28,548
A dimensional tremor has started,

25
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:31,384
and its magnitude is
gradually increasing!

26
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:33,519
If the magnitude continues
to increase at this rate,

27
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,423
we estimate the creation of
a dimensional fault in thirty minutes!

28
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:42,361
The Garden's reactors are Lost Logia
of the same type as the Jewel Seeds!

29
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,831
She's engaged them,
fully aware that they might

30
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,022
run out of control, to supply her
the output that she lacks!

31
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:51,616
She meant this to be a one-way trip
from the very beginning!

32
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,513
Chrono, where are you going?

33
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,216
I'm going to head to the scene!

34
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:05,118
I have to stop the cause of it all!

35
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:06,786
I'll go with you!

36
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:07,897
Me too!

37
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,423
All right.

38
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,658
Aruf, you stay by Fate's side.

39
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,160
Right!

40
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:15,161
Let's go!

41
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:16,762
Yeah!

42
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:20,198
Chrono, Miss Nanoha, Yuuno!

43
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,201
I'm going to head on-site as well!

44
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,138
I will trust you all with the arrest
of Precia Testarossa!

45
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:26,369
Roger!

46
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:38,787
The Time of the Sealing of Our Fates

47
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:11,918
There's lots of them.

48
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,585
This is only the entrance.

49
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,388
There are many more inside.

50
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,224
Chrono, what are they?

51
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:21,385
They're nothing but machines
that attack nearby targets.

52
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,629
I see.

53
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,969
Then there's nothing to worry about.

54
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:30,407
You don't need to waste time
on opponents of this level.

55
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,913
Stinger Snipe.

56
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:45,604
So quick!

57
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:48,561
Snipe Shot!

58
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,616
Break Impulse.

59
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,682
Don't just stand there! Let's go!

60
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:17,763
Okay!

61
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,137
That hole... Be careful of anywhere
that has black spaces!

62
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,366
The imaginary number plane.

63
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:36,527
It's a space where no magic
can be executed!

64
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:40,873
Flying magic will also be deleted.

65
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:44,243
If you fall in, you'll fall to the bottom
of the gravitational pull,

66
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:46,212
and never be able to
get yourself out of it!

67
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,023
I'll be careful!

68
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:59,325
We're going to split up here!

69
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:02,328
You two, seal the reactor
on the top floor!

70
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:03,896
What about you, Chrono?

71
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,798
I'm going to head over to Precia.

72
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,989
That's my job, after all.

73
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,737
I'lll make you a path right now!
When I do...

74
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:12,638
Yeah!

75
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,347
Blaze Cannon.

76
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,618
Chrono, be careful!

77
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,324
I will be going as well!

78
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:33,926
Put up a distortion shield
within the Garden,

79
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,977
and hold back the progress
of the dimensional tremor!

80
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:43,602
I'm worried about those kids,

81
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,108
so I'm going to go
help them out a little too.

82
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,410
I'll be back soon.

83
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,280
And when everything is all done...

84
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,282
It doesn't matter how slowly,

85
00:06:56,283 --> 00:07:00,686
but I want you to turn back to
the real Fate that I love so much.

86
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:05,377
From now on, you're free to use
all the time you have for yourself.

87
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:36,786
Mother didn't smile at me once,
to the very end.

88
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:44,156
The only reason I wanted to live on
was for Mother to accept me.

89
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,834
No matter how much
she claimed I lacked,

90
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,825
no matter what horrible
things she did to me.

91
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,053
Still, I wanted her to smile.

92
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:00,146
Even after she threw me
aside so clearly,

93
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,077
I am still clinging to Mother.

94
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,244
Aruf...

95
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:13,094
Aruf, you've been at my side
for all this time.

96
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:16,529
I'm sure you were deeply saddened

97
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,020
when I didn't listen to
what you had to say.

98
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:25,589
That girl in the white outfit that
I clashed with so many times...

99
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,375
The first person who
looked at me straight on,

100
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,426
and treated me as an equal.

101
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,126
I saw her many times,
I fought her many times,

102
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:39,915
and she called out my name
so many times.

103
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,535
Over and over...

104
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:54,871
The only reason I wanted to live on
was for Mother to accept me!

105
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:59,059
I had thought that there was
no other reason for me to live!

106
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,390
I thought that I wouldn't be able
to live on if I couldn't do it!

107
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:13,411
It's not good to just throw it out.

108
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:19,405
And it's even worse to just
keep running away from it.

109
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:41,375
Nothing with me... between us...
has even begun?

110
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,767
Is that so, Bardiche?

111
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:58,488
Perhaps I haven't even really started?

112
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,355
Get set.

113
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,608
That's right.

114
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,559
You've been at my side for
all this time too, Bardiche!

115
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,586
You don't want it to end
like this either, right?

116
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:21,607
Yes, sir.

117
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:41,941
I'm not sure if I can do it well,
but let's try our best together.

118
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:46,942
You taught me to escape
from the clear skies

119
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,083
The quiet wish that
wells up in my heart

120
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:52,818
Recovery.

121
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,320
Let's get ourselves
back into our hands

122
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,555
Nothing between us has even begun.

123
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,057
Nothing between us has even begun.

124
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:03,058
On the other end of the sky
as I look up, your gaze

125
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:05,097
Gets hit by the rain
of caring and disappears

126
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:08,334
That is why, in order for me
to begin my true self,

127
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,069
That is why, in order for me
to begin my true self,

128
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,938
Let me down, it doesn't stop

129
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:13,138
I have to put an end to
what I have been until now!

130
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,208
I have to put an end to
what I have been until now!

131
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:17,610
Shake up, realizing for the first time,
entrusting, take a shot

132
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:20,846
Looking around, you were there

133
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:25,017
The reason why I can fight
without hesitation

134
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:29,888
Is so that I can bloom
in wondrous colors

135
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,757
To look straight at my weak heart

136
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:34,693
Dammit! There are too many enemies!

137
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,654
To look straight at my weak heart

138
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,098
It would be nice if that was all.

139
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:40,032
It would be nice if that was all.

140
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,133
You...

141
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:45,604
Whichever way I turn, which way
to walk headed for where

142
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:45,638
I have to do something!

143
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,139
I have to do something!

144
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,643
I just stood there, unable to decide
on my own path to take

145
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:51,744
Nanoha!

146
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:53,245
I just stood there, unable to decide
on my own path to take

147
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:54,847
Without losing hope
in the distant future

148
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:55,948
Nanoha!

149
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:59,785
Without losing hope
in the distant future

150
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:00,352
Thunder Rage.

151
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:01,353
Thunder Rage.

152
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:05,357
Unbreakable courage
hidden in the clouds

153
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:09,061
I have drive, call it awake

154
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,195
Get set.

155
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:10,295
Get set.

156
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:10,896
Take off, shaken, woken up,
asked, pave the way

157
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,297
Thunder...

158
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:12,931
Take off, shaken, woken up,
asked, pave the way

159
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,266
Rage!

160
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:14,600
Take off, shaken, woken up,
asked, pave the way

161
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:17,703
I will go with you, without worries

162
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:19,672
Why did you keep hesitating?

163
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:20,673
Fate?!

164
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:21,740
Why did you keep hesitating?

165
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:26,741
So that I can win a clear victory

166
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,750
Let's grab countless
wishes in our hands

167
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,718
It's a big one... The barrier is strong.

168
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:35,087
It's a big one... The barrier is strong.

169
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,488
Yeah. And that thing on its back!

170
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,026
But if the two of us are together...

171
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,001
Yeah! Yeah, yeah!

172
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:50,169
Let's go, Bardiche!

173
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,670
Get set.

174
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:54,281
Us too, Raising Heart!

175
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,401
Stand by ready.

176
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:03,144
Strongly, gently,
give wind to the wings

177
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:05,384
Thunder...

178
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:06,952
Thunder...

179
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,688
Shake up, realizing for the first time,
entrusting, take a shot

180
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:10,089
There is nothing that I can lose

181
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,924
Smasher!

182
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:12,791
There is nothing that I can lose

183
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,260
Shaken, woken up,
asked, pave the way

184
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,762
Divine Buster!

185
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:20,265
Divine Buster!

186
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,934
So that I can win a clear victory

187
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,769
Let's grab countless
wishes in our hands

188
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,437
Here we go!

189
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:28,458
Let's grab countless
wishes in our hands

190
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,187
You're here!

191
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,788
But you didn't make it in time!

192
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,749
Right, Alicia?

193
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,031
Oh, Alicia...

194
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,526
Fate!

195
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:24,963
Fate!

196
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,184
Fate! Fate!

197
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,344
Aruf...

198
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,713
I'm sorry I made you worry.

199
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,374
I'll end it with my own hands,

200
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,885
and after that,
I'll begin who I really am.

201
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:56,677
Just a little bit more...

202
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,943
We can head to the reactor
from that elevator.

203
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:12,784
Okay, thanks!

204
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:17,003
Fate, are you going to
head over to your mom?

205
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,810
I, um, I can't really put it
into words well...

206
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,358
Good luck.

207
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,341
Thanks.

208
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,923
Right now, Chrono is
headed there on his own.

209
00:15:57,924 --> 00:15:59,892
If we don't hurry,
we might not make it in time!

210
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:00,743
Fate!

211
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:05,684
Amy!

212
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:10,202
Nanoha and Yuuno have
entered the reactor!

213
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:12,571
Fate and Aruf are headed
to the bottom floor!

214
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:15,007
It's all right! I'm sure we can do it!

215
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:15,968
Yeah!

216
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,332
I'll take care of defense.

217
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,201
Nanoha, concentrate on the sealing!

218
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:45,892
Yeah. Just like always, right?

219
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,800
Yuuno, you've always been together
with me, and protected me.

220
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:56,054
Sealing Mode.

221
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:01,920
That's why I can fight!

222
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:04,201
Because I have that
warmth at my back!

223
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:16,902
Let's go!

224
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:19,973
Divine Shooter, full power!

225
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,376
Shoot!

226
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,086
Precia Testarossa...

227
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:46,965
This is the end.

228
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,156
I am suppressing the
dimensional tremor.

229
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,305
The reactor will be
sealed away in due time,

230
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:55,966
and there is an Enforcer
headed towards you.

231
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:00,746
The forgotten capital, Alhazard,

232
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,115
and all the secret spells that lie there,

233
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:06,186
their existence is only a vague myth!

234
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,954
That's not true!

235
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:11,675
The path to Alhazard lies in
the gap between dimensions!

236
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,527
When time and space are shattered,

237
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:18,730
the glimmers that fall into their gap...

238
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,951
The path surely lies there!

239
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:24,415
A gamble that has such
a slim chance of winning...

240
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:35,409
What in the world do you
want to do by going there?

241
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:40,566
Bring back the lost time and take back
the mistakes you made?

242
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:45,497
That's right!

243
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:48,726
I'm going to bring back into my hands

244
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:53,889
the past and the future
for Alicia and I!

245
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,367
I'm going to bring it back.

246
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,140
This wasn't how it
was supposed to be.

247
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,811
Everything in the world...

248
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:14,820
This world is always full of things

249
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,281
that weren't supposed to be this way!

250
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:22,654
From the past, for all time,
for anyone, that's how it is!

251
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,236
Everyone is free to run away
from or stand up against

252
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:34,806
the reality that wasn't how
it was supposed to be!

253
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:37,609
But, nowhere, nobody has the right

254
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:42,090
to rope innocent people into
your selfish depression!

255
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,580
Mother!

256
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,648
What did you come here for?

257
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:59,748
Begone. I have no more use for you.

258
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,097
I came here because I wanted
to say something to you.

259
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:11,876
L.

260
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:19,668
I am not Alicia Testarossa!

261
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,776
I may be just a doll
that you have created.

262
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:49,177
But, I, Fate Testarossa,

263
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:54,415
am your daughter, that you
brought to life and raised!

264
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,231
So what?!

265
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:09,272
Are you telling me to think of you
as a daughter after all this?

266
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:14,153
If you so wish.

267
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,279
If you so wish,

268
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,416
I will protect you from
anyone in this world,

269
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:27,026
and from anything that goes on.

270
00:21:30,223 --> 00:21:33,003
Not because I am your daughter.

271
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:38,177
But because you are my mother!

272
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,072
How stupid.

273
00:21:58,684 --> 00:21:59,764
Not good!

274
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,459
Captain, it's no good!

275
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,528
The Garden is going to fall apart!
Please come back!

276
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:14,766
Destruction of this caliber won't
cause a dimensional fault!

277
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,768
Chrono, all of you should escape now!

278
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:19,139
There isn't much time before
that place is destroyed!

279
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:22,340
Roger that!

280
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,630
Fate Testarossa!

281
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:26,301
Fate!

282
00:22:30,283 --> 00:22:33,122
I am going to head to Alhazard!

283
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,621
And I will bring everything back!

284
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:40,402
My past, my future, and my
one and only happiness!

285
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:46,231
Mother!

286
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:47,162
Fate!

287
00:22:56,742 --> 00:23:00,312
Let us go together, Alicia.

288
00:23:00,313 --> 00:23:02,923
This time, so that we don't
part from one another...

289
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,316
Fate!

290
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:13,836
Please, everyone!
Hurry up and escape!

291
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:25,437
Make a little wish

292
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:30,238
Even though at times
I'll trip or get lost

293
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:41,226
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic

294
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:51,592
Ah, going over the sea of cellophane
and over the forests

295
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:57,068
Passing through the silver wind

296
00:23:57,069 --> 00:24:01,306
I was looking for something
neither of us had

297
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:06,307
Ah, I was just crying inside
a diorama of a city

298
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:12,947
Until I met that warm hand that
reached out to me that day

299
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:20,488
Among the swaying days,
I felt a strong gaze

300
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:27,661
Hey, I finally, finally
found the secret key

301
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,704
Make a little wish

302
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:37,335
Collecting the lemon-colored
drops from the moon

303
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:43,644
I want to keep a light shining
on the road that you travel down

304
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:47,385
Make a little wish

305
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:52,076
I wonder if there is something
I can do even though I'm so little

306
00:24:53,092 --> 00:25:03,382
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic

307
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:15,947
The incident has finally
come to an end.

308
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:18,988
Finally, the ending that arrives,
and the time of parting.

309
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:25,688
But an ending is always
the beginning of something else.
