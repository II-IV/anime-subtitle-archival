1
00:00:07,204 --> 00:00:10,640
A sudden incident has befallen me,
Nanoha Takamachi,

2
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:13,391
a girl who was supposed to be
an ordinary third-grader.

3
00:00:14,578 --> 00:00:18,968
I was handed a red gem, and with it
I was given magical powers.

4
00:00:20,418 --> 00:00:24,668
Coincidences led by new meetings
now emit light, and begin to move.

5
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:29,981
Feelings that intertwine,
and the story that begins...

6
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:34,809
The start of the days where magic
and ordinary life are in parallel.

7
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:40,304
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha
is about to begin!

8
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,225
Cradling my knees in
a corner of my room

9
00:01:02,226 --> 00:01:05,595
I always shivered from uncertainty

10
00:01:05,596 --> 00:01:10,596
I was scared of learning the truth,
so I closed the door

11
00:01:12,803 --> 00:01:17,803
I found my own place within a kind lie
and I fled inside my dreams

12
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:25,311
I dye a sea of loneliness that
nobody knows of into a deep blue

13
00:01:28,552 --> 00:01:33,552
An intense feeling to
hide the loneliness

14
00:01:34,525 --> 00:01:39,525
Is continually injuring your heart

15
00:01:40,765 --> 00:01:45,435
The secret hidden
deep within the eyes

16
00:01:45,436 --> 00:01:49,973
To the truth behind the smile
that draws me in

17
00:01:49,974 --> 00:01:54,974
I will deliver a love so soft

18
00:01:55,446 --> 00:01:59,949
Right now, a warmth that might
break upon touching it

19
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,554
Parts itself from the past,
and overflows

20
00:02:04,555 --> 00:02:09,091
I'll be by your side forever

21
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:18,153
Do not be lured into
the somber shadows

22
00:02:29,046 --> 00:02:31,266
You're kidding. What is this?!

23
00:02:41,592 --> 00:02:43,232
What?!

24
00:02:43,694 --> 00:02:48,914
Episode 2: My Magical
Incantation is Lyrical?

25
00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:56,071
What is this?

26
00:02:57,441 --> 00:02:58,401
It's coming!

27
00:03:07,685 --> 00:03:09,115
Protection.

28
00:03:28,372 --> 00:03:31,107
Our powers, called programs,
are magical equations

29
00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:33,609
that are embedded into executors.

30
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:38,881
The caster's mental energy is
needed to execute those equations.

31
00:03:42,186 --> 00:03:47,186
And that is a thought entity,
created under an ominous power.

32
00:03:47,191 --> 00:03:50,192
To stop its activity, you need
to seal it with that staff,

33
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:52,184
and turn it back into its original form.

34
00:03:53,097 --> 00:03:56,432
I don't really get it.
What should I do?

35
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:58,701
Just like what you did earlier,
basic movements

36
00:03:58,702 --> 00:04:02,472
such as attacking and defending will
happen just by wishing for them.

37
00:04:02,473 --> 00:04:05,007
However, to use magic that
requires a higher level of power,

38
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:06,809
you need spells.

39
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:07,911
Spells?

40
00:04:07,912 --> 00:04:09,312
Open your heart.

41
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,660
Your own spell should come
to mind within your heart.

42
00:04:31,802 --> 00:04:32,942
Protection.

43
00:04:38,809 --> 00:04:40,559
Lyrical, magical...

44
00:04:41,645 --> 00:04:44,080
What needs to be sealed away
is the ominous container,

45
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:45,071
the Jewel Seed!

46
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,609
Seal the Jewel Seed!

47
00:04:49,987 --> 00:04:51,888
Sealing Mode.

48
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:52,879
Set up.

49
00:05:07,905 --> 00:05:09,364
Stand by, ready.

50
00:05:10,507 --> 00:05:12,208
Lyrical, magical...

51
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:14,639
Jewel Seed, Serial 21...

52
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,110
Seal!

53
00:05:17,848 --> 00:05:18,898
Sealing.

54
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,440
This is a Jewel Seed.

55
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:43,909
Touch it with Raging Heart.

56
00:05:48,812 --> 00:05:50,452
Receipt: No. XXI.

57
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:06,996
Hey...

58
00:06:06,997 --> 00:06:08,698
Is it over?

59
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,534
Yes, all thanks to you.

60
00:06:11,535 --> 00:06:12,525
Thank you so much.

61
00:06:14,972 --> 00:06:17,342
Hold on! Are you all right?! Hey!

62
00:06:21,312 --> 00:06:23,646
Maybe...

63
00:06:23,647 --> 00:06:27,216
It's not such a good idea
for me to stay here?

64
00:06:27,217 --> 00:06:29,585
For now...

65
00:06:29,586 --> 00:06:31,666
I'm sorry!

66
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:48,191
I'm sorry.

67
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,430
Did I wake you up?

68
00:06:51,742 --> 00:06:53,710
Sorry for being so rough.

69
00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:55,021
Are you hurt?

70
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:58,879
My wounds are fine. They've
almost completely healed already.

71
00:07:04,788 --> 00:07:08,624
No kidding. Most of the
wounds are gone.

72
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:09,726
That's amazing.

73
00:07:09,727 --> 00:07:11,060
Because you came to help me,

74
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:13,340
I was able to use my remaining
magic power to heal.

75
00:07:13,897 --> 00:07:16,699
I don't really get it, but okay.

76
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,599
Hey, can I introduce myself?

77
00:07:19,336 --> 00:07:20,403
Sure.

78
00:07:20,404 --> 00:07:21,771
Ahem.

79
00:07:21,772 --> 00:07:23,806
I'm Nanoha Takamachi.

80
00:07:23,807 --> 00:07:25,675
I'm in third grade.

81
00:07:25,676 --> 00:07:29,546
My family and my close friends
all call me Nanoha!

82
00:07:30,848 --> 00:07:32,815
I'm Yuuno Scrya.

83
00:07:32,816 --> 00:07:36,155
Scrya is my clan name,
so Yuuno would be my name.

84
00:07:36,954 --> 00:07:39,564
Yuuno? That's a cute name.

85
00:07:41,658 --> 00:07:43,528
I'm sorry, I got you...

86
00:07:45,062 --> 00:07:46,082
Nanoha.

87
00:07:48,065 --> 00:07:51,067
I got you, Nanoha,
involved in all of this.

88
00:07:51,068 --> 00:07:52,738
Well, that's...

89
00:07:54,938 --> 00:07:57,640
Well, I think I'm okay!

90
00:07:57,641 --> 00:07:58,808
Oh, that's right!

91
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:02,211
Since you're hurt, Yuuno,
you can't relax here.

92
00:08:02,212 --> 00:08:04,714
For now, let's go to my house.

93
00:08:04,715 --> 00:08:07,325
We'll figure out the rest there, okay?

94
00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:18,197
Welcome back.

95
00:08:19,997 --> 00:08:22,732
Big brother...

96
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:25,701
Where did you wander off to, so late?

97
00:08:25,702 --> 00:08:29,205
Um, well, um, uh...

98
00:08:29,206 --> 00:08:31,374
My, it's so cute!

99
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,342
Big sister?!

100
00:08:33,342 --> 00:08:35,344
Oh, it doesn't seem to be so cheerful.

101
00:08:35,345 --> 00:08:38,748
Nanoha, did you go visit there
because you were worried about it?

102
00:08:38,749 --> 00:08:40,349
Well, um...

103
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,852
I understand how you feel.

104
00:08:42,852 --> 00:08:45,721
But you still can't run off
without telling anyone.

105
00:08:45,722 --> 00:08:47,824
Come on, it's all right.

106
00:08:47,825 --> 00:08:50,693
She made it back safe and sound.

107
00:08:50,694 --> 00:08:52,395
Besides, Nanoha, you're a good girl,

108
00:08:52,396 --> 00:08:54,730
so you won't do anything
like this again, right?

109
00:08:54,731 --> 00:08:56,766
Well, um... Big brother...

110
00:08:56,767 --> 00:09:00,427
I'm sorry I made you worry by leaving
the house without telling anyone.

111
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:02,004
Right.

112
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:03,875
Okay, that settles everything!

113
00:09:09,213 --> 00:09:11,848
This is a very cute little animal!

114
00:09:11,849 --> 00:09:16,285
Wouldn't Mom roll around
in panic because it's so cute?

115
00:09:16,286 --> 00:09:18,476
I won't deny that possibility.

116
00:09:45,849 --> 00:09:47,689
Morning, Yuuno.

117
00:09:48,785 --> 00:09:50,245
Er... Good morning.

118
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:55,525
Well, for starters, kudos on
the hard work last night.

119
00:09:55,526 --> 00:09:57,695
Likewise.

120
00:10:00,264 --> 00:10:03,634
Last night, when I showed
Yuuno to Dad and Mom...

121
00:10:05,135 --> 00:10:07,103
It's so cute!

122
00:10:07,104 --> 00:10:09,238
He's adorable! He's just too adorable!

123
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:11,507
Mom, take it easy!
He's adorable! He's just too adorable!

124
00:10:11,508 --> 00:10:12,108
He's adorable! He's just too adorable!

125
00:10:12,109 --> 00:10:12,975
This is a rather wise-looking weasel.
He's adorable! He's just too adorable!

126
00:10:12,976 --> 00:10:15,411
This is a rather wise-looking weasel.

127
00:10:15,412 --> 00:10:17,380
It's a ferret, Dad.

128
00:10:17,381 --> 00:10:19,782
Can it do any tricks?

129
00:10:19,783 --> 00:10:21,043
Here, shake.

130
00:10:25,956 --> 00:10:28,257
It's really intelligent!

131
00:10:28,258 --> 00:10:30,560
And so, the family was in a frenzy.

132
00:10:30,561 --> 00:10:35,561
Afterwards, we were running around
deciding on things like Yuuno's food,

133
00:10:35,966 --> 00:10:38,626
so I didn't get to talk
to him much last night.

134
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,938
Are you used to calling me
by my name now?

135
00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:43,579
Right, Nanoha.

136
00:10:44,074 --> 00:10:47,843
The only conversation I got in
was to call me by my name,

137
00:10:47,844 --> 00:10:50,154
and talk to me like a friend.

138
00:10:52,082 --> 00:10:55,184
Okay, I have to go to school now.

139
00:10:55,185 --> 00:10:56,994
But I'd like to hear more
when I get home.

140
00:10:58,355 --> 00:11:01,785
That's all right. We can have a
conversation even if we're apart.

141
00:11:04,194 --> 00:11:06,884
Nanoha, you're already a mage.

142
00:11:11,201 --> 00:11:14,036
It's like when you called for me.

143
00:11:14,037 --> 00:11:14,937
Right.

144
00:11:15,572 --> 00:11:19,382
Keep Raging Heart with you,
and talk to me within your heart.

145
00:11:21,044 --> 00:11:22,124
Let's see...

146
00:11:24,448 --> 00:11:25,848
Like this?

147
00:11:25,849 --> 00:11:27,689
Right. Isn'tit easy?

148
00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:31,187
You're right!

149
00:11:31,188 --> 00:11:33,148
I'll talk to you when
you have free time.

150
00:11:33,957 --> 00:11:37,937
About me, about magic,
about the Jewel Seeds...

151
00:11:53,143 --> 00:11:54,663
Lyrical Nanoha!

152
00:11:58,115 --> 00:11:59,382
Good morning!

153
00:11:59,383 --> 00:12:01,603
Nanoha! Did you hear about
what happened last night?

154
00:12:02,953 --> 00:12:03,986
Last night?

155
00:12:03,987 --> 00:12:05,988
Apparently there was a car accident

156
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:08,391
at the veterinary clinic that
we went to yesterday,

157
00:12:08,392 --> 00:12:10,926
and one of the walls got destroyed.

158
00:12:10,927 --> 00:12:13,663
I'm worried about whether
that ferret is still okay.

159
00:12:13,664 --> 00:12:14,484
Yeah...

160
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:18,145
Well, about that...

161
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:23,005
I see! So he's fine,
and at Nanoha's house now.

162
00:12:23,006 --> 00:12:25,241
But that was some coincidence.

163
00:12:25,242 --> 00:12:29,245
Coming across him in the streets
after it ran away from the clinic!

164
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:30,146
Right?

165
00:12:31,682 --> 00:12:34,016
I'm not lying, I'm not lying!

166
00:12:34,017 --> 00:12:36,267
I just fudged the truth a tiny bit.

167
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,993
Oh, and it seems like that ferret
wasn't anyone's pet,

168
00:12:43,994 --> 00:12:46,996
so we'll be taking care
of him for a while.

169
00:12:46,997 --> 00:12:48,367
I see!

170
00:12:48,665 --> 00:12:52,334
We've gotta give him a name.
Did you already decide on one?

171
00:12:52,335 --> 00:12:55,071
Yeah, he's named Yuuno.

172
00:12:55,072 --> 00:12:56,605
Yuuno?

173
00:12:56,606 --> 00:12:58,307
Yeah, Yuuno.

174
00:12:58,308 --> 00:12:59,298
I see.

175
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,178
As I said in a previous lesson,

176
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:04,647
a kanji is made up of a
foundation and an annex.

177
00:13:04,648 --> 00:13:06,182
By combining the two parts together,

178
00:13:06,183 --> 00:13:08,050
a kanji can have different meanings,

179
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:09,051
even though it is only one character.

180
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,321
That is because a foundation
has its own meaning,

181
00:13:12,322 --> 00:13:14,523
and the annex has its
own meaning as well.

182
00:13:14,524 --> 00:13:14,990
and the annex has its
own meaning as well.

183
00:13:14,991 --> 00:13:18,094
Examples of foundations are: the
ninben which stands for a human,

184
00:13:18,095 --> 00:13:22,998
the sanzui which represents water,
and the kihen which stands for a tree.

185
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:24,699
Now, here's a little quiz.

186
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:31,541
The Jewel Seeds are ancient
treasures in our world.

187
00:13:34,344 --> 00:13:39,344
They originally were magical stones
that granted wishes for their holders,

188
00:13:39,382 --> 00:13:41,984
but their execution
of power is unstable.

189
00:13:41,985 --> 00:13:44,153
Just like last night, they go
out of control on their own.

190
00:13:44,154 --> 00:13:47,814
They can harm their environment
in their search for a valid user.

191
00:13:53,764 --> 00:13:57,233
Sometimes they go out of
control using the powers

192
00:13:57,234 --> 00:14:00,803
of mistaken executions by people or
animals that randomly find them.

193
00:14:00,804 --> 00:14:03,994
Why are such dangerous things
sitting around in my neighborhood?

194
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,805
It's all my fault.

195
00:14:08,678 --> 00:14:11,838
Back where I came from, my job
is to excavate ancient ruins.

196
00:14:12,783 --> 00:14:16,652
And one day, I found them
in an ancient monument.

197
00:14:16,653 --> 00:14:20,389
I had asked the research group
to hold onto them.

198
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,158
However, the time-space
transporter carrying them

199
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,529
met either an accident or
some kind of artificial tragedy.

200
00:14:34,404 --> 00:14:38,504
Twenty-one Jewel Seeds were
dispersed all over this world.

201
00:14:40,143 --> 00:14:42,803
So far, I've been able to find only two.

202
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,520
So there's nineteen more?

203
00:14:47,117 --> 00:14:47,937
Rise!

204
00:14:52,556 --> 00:14:55,686
Isn't the balsam getting
much bigger now?

205
00:14:56,526 --> 00:14:57,986
How many centimeters tall is it?

206
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,265
Wait? Hold on a second.

207
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:05,100
Listening to that story,

208
00:15:05,101 --> 00:15:10,101
the Jewel Seeds getting dispersed
wasn't really your fault at all, Yuuno.

209
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:14,643
But I was the one that found them,

210
00:15:14,644 --> 00:15:16,212
so I have to find them all,

211
00:15:16,213 --> 00:15:18,762
and return them to the
place where they belong.

212
00:15:20,317 --> 00:15:21,784
Just a little...

213
00:15:21,785 --> 00:15:26,125
Just a little, I think I understand
how you feel, Yuuno.

214
00:15:27,757 --> 00:15:30,306
Yuuno, you take things very seriously.

215
00:15:32,462 --> 00:15:34,096
Oh, that's right.

216
00:15:34,097 --> 00:15:37,533
Did you put up signs saying these
plants are under observation?

217
00:15:37,534 --> 00:15:39,902
It would be quite the problem
if someone plucked them out,

218
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:41,363
thinking they were weeds!

219
00:15:42,873 --> 00:15:44,540
Oh, and of course, make sure to

220
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:47,610
write your name and the date
you planted the seed on the sign.

221
00:15:47,611 --> 00:15:48,811
Well...

222
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:53,812
I'm sorry I roped you into it
last night by having to save me.

223
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:57,253
But all I want from here on
is a little bit of time to rest,

224
00:15:57,254 --> 00:15:59,804
until my magical powers
are back to full strength.

225
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,523
A week...

226
00:16:01,524 --> 00:16:04,293
No, five days should be enough
to get my powers back,

227
00:16:04,294 --> 00:16:05,284
so until then...

228
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,910
When they come back,
what will you do?

229
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:13,333
I'll go on my search for the
Jewel Seeds again, alone.

230
00:16:14,704 --> 00:16:16,438
I won't allow that.

231
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:18,173
You won't allow it?!

232
00:16:18,174 --> 00:16:21,577
It's impossible for me to help you
during school and cram school,

233
00:16:21,578 --> 00:16:24,280
but other than that, I can help.

234
00:16:24,281 --> 00:16:27,300
But there will be dangerous times,
just like last night.

235
00:16:33,924 --> 00:16:36,191
I mean, I've gotten
to know you already,

236
00:16:36,192 --> 00:16:38,260
and I've heard your story.

237
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:39,895
I can't just let you go.

238
00:16:39,896 --> 00:16:43,933
Besides, if something like last night
were to happen here often,

239
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:46,334
it would trouble everyone
around us, right?

240
00:16:47,637 --> 00:16:52,207
Yuuno, you're all alone and have
nobody around to help you, right?

241
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:55,747
It's lonely to be all by yourself.
So let me help you.

242
00:16:59,883 --> 00:17:02,251
If someone needs your help,

243
00:17:02,252 --> 00:17:05,220
and you have the power
to help them out,

244
00:17:05,221 --> 00:17:07,690
you shouldn't debate
whether to help or not.

245
00:17:07,691 --> 00:17:09,621
That's what Dad taught me.

246
00:17:15,365 --> 00:17:17,065
Yuuno, you're in trouble,

247
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,660
and I can help you out, right?
With the power of magic.

248
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:27,409
Yeah...

249
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,690
I'm not sure if I can be
a proper mage or not, but...

250
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,520
You're already a mage, Nanoha.

251
00:17:36,286 --> 00:17:39,288
I think you have much more
talent for it than I do.

252
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:40,556
Really?

253
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:43,359
I'm not really sure about that myself,

254
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,290
but for starters, please
teach me all sorts of things.

255
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:46,879
Bye-bye!

256
00:17:48,264 --> 00:17:50,043
I'll do my best!

257
00:17:51,768 --> 00:17:53,908
Yeah... Thanks.

258
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:57,706
Okay, I'm almost home now!

259
00:17:57,707 --> 00:18:00,197
For now, how about we have
some snacks together?

260
00:18:00,844 --> 00:18:02,924
Sure. Thanks.

261
00:18:04,314 --> 00:18:06,394
I wonder what today's snack will be?

262
00:18:18,261 --> 00:18:19,828
Excuse me...

263
00:18:19,829 --> 00:18:21,897
Yuuno, that thing just now...

264
00:18:21,898 --> 00:18:24,500
A new Jewel Seed has been executed!

265
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:25,968
It's really close by!

266
00:18:25,969 --> 00:18:27,302
What should I do?

267
00:18:27,303 --> 00:18:30,406
Let's head over there together.
Please help me.

268
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:31,367
Okay.

269
00:18:48,425 --> 00:18:50,426
Nanoha! Raging Heart!

270
00:18:50,427 --> 00:18:52,097
Okay!

271
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:04,115
It's already taken in one
of the local creatures.

272
00:19:05,408 --> 00:19:06,428
What's going to happen?!

273
00:19:10,447 --> 00:19:12,496
It will be tougher, because
it has a physical body!

274
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,393
It'll be all right, I think.

275
00:19:16,886 --> 00:19:17,755
Nanoha!

276
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,145
Boot up the Raging Heart!

277
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,748
How do I boot it?

278
00:19:26,463 --> 00:19:29,465
Start at "I am the one who has been
given a mission!" The boot password!

279
00:19:29,466 --> 00:19:30,226
What?!

280
00:19:32,035 --> 00:19:34,903
I can't remember such a long spell!

281
00:19:34,904 --> 00:19:36,972
I'll tell you again, so repeat after me!

282
00:19:36,973 --> 00:19:37,933
Got it!

283
00:19:50,753 --> 00:19:52,592
Raging Heart?

284
00:19:54,424 --> 00:19:56,358
Stand by ready.

285
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,228
Set up.

286
00:20:09,005 --> 00:20:11,965
She booted up the Raging Heart
without a password?!

287
00:20:15,612 --> 00:20:17,132
Nanoha, the protective armor!

288
00:20:18,748 --> 00:20:20,268
Barrier Jacket.

289
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:31,757
Nanoha!

290
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,863
Protect condition: all green.

291
00:21:00,456 --> 00:21:02,356
No damage dealt from that blow?

292
00:21:03,226 --> 00:21:07,196
Just as I thought, this girl has
an amazing amount of talent.

293
00:21:07,197 --> 00:21:10,599
Ouch... but it didn't hurt
enough to make me say it.

294
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,469
Let's see. I need to do
that sealing thing, right?

295
00:21:14,637 --> 00:21:17,506
Raging Heart, please?

296
00:21:17,507 --> 00:21:18,774
All right.

297
00:21:18,775 --> 00:21:20,825
Sealing Mode, set up.

298
00:21:36,593 --> 00:21:38,233
Stand by ready.

299
00:21:39,128 --> 00:21:40,896
Lyrical, magical...

300
00:21:40,897 --> 00:21:43,177
Jewel Seed, Serial 16...

301
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:45,497
Seal!

302
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,306
Sealing.

303
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:11,899
Receipt: No. XVI.

304
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,564
Is this good enough?

305
00:22:15,565 --> 00:22:18,225
Yeabh, it couldn't have
been any better.

306
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:31,900
What? Did I trip and hit
my head or something?

307
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:44,251
I guess this is where you say,
"Thanks for the hard work"?

308
00:22:45,094 --> 00:22:47,344
Yeah, that's right.

309
00:22:48,097 --> 00:22:52,167
The first long day after I,
Nanoha Takamachi,

310
00:22:52,168 --> 00:22:54,568
became a mage is about to end.

311
00:22:55,571 --> 00:23:00,208
About my new friend Yuuno...
About magic...

312
00:23:00,209 --> 00:23:03,145
About being uncertain, and
what I don't understand...

313
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:05,286
All in all, there are lots of things.

314
00:23:06,015 --> 00:23:08,295
Come to think of it, I'm starving.

315
00:23:10,586 --> 00:23:14,276
For now, I think I just have to
do my best in all sorts of things.

316
00:23:26,135 --> 00:23:27,102
Make a little wish

317
00:23:27,103 --> 00:23:31,933
Even though at times
I'll trip or get lost

318
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:42,891
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic

319
00:23:48,257 --> 00:23:53,257
Ah, going over the sea of
cellophane and over the forests

320
00:23:55,064 --> 00:23:58,767
Passing through the silver wind

321
00:23:58,768 --> 00:24:02,804
I was looking for something
neither of us had

322
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:07,805
Ah, I was just crying
inside a diorama of a city

323
00:24:09,612 --> 00:24:14,612
Until I met that warm hand that
reached out to me that day

324
00:24:17,153 --> 00:24:22,153
Among the swaying days,
I felt a strong gaze

325
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:29,360
Hey, I finally, finally
found the secret key

326
00:24:32,735 --> 00:24:34,403
Make a little wish

327
00:24:34,404 --> 00:24:39,004
Collecting the lemon-colored
drops from the moon

328
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:45,309
I want to keep a light shining on
the road that you travel down

329
00:24:47,383 --> 00:24:48,917
Make a little wish

330
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:53,717
I wonder if there is something I
can do even though I'm so little

331
00:24:54,757 --> 00:25:05,197
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic

332
00:25:13,476 --> 00:25:17,879
This and that as a mage,
such and such as a magical girl...

333
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,851
I, Nanoha Takamachi, will do
my best with lots of energy!

334
00:25:22,852 --> 00:25:25,187
But problems are piled up
like a mountain!

335
00:25:25,188 --> 00:25:27,456
Next up is an incident so big
it involves the entire city?!

336
00:25:27,457 --> 00:25:29,424
Geez, it's so tough!
