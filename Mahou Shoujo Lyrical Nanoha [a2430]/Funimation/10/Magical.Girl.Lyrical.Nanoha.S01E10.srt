1
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:06,005
It was a small incident that happened
to me, Nanoha Takamachi,

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,616
a girl who was supposed to be
an ordinary third-grader.

3
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:13,757
I accepted the heart of courage,
and I gained magical powers.

4
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:18,017
We've seen each other, and
came into contact many times,

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,888
yet we still know nothing
about each other.

6
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:24,936
I want to hear the answer...
I want to share...

7
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:28,206
That is why I decided
to face her straight on.

8
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,997
Getting rid of all doubts,

9
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:33,928
believing only in the magic
that dwells in my heart.

10
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:38,819
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha
is about to begin.

11
00:00:56,557 --> 00:01:00,493
Cradling my knees in
a corner of my room

12
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:04,062
I always shivered from uncertainty

13
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:09,064
I was scared of learning the truth,
so I closed the door

14
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:16,105
I found my own place within a kind lie
and I fled inside my dreams

15
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:23,412
I dye a sea of loneliness that
nobody knows of into a deep blue

16
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:31,987
An intense feeling to
hide the loneliness

17
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,960
Is continually injuring your heart

18
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:43,735
The secret hidden deep
within the eyes

19
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:48,241
To the truth behind the smile
that draws me in

20
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:53,242
I will deliver a love so soft

21
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:58,217
Right now, a warmth that might
break upon touching it

22
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:02,988
Parts itself from the past,
and overflows

23
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,360
I'll be by your side forever

24
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:16,421
Do not be lured into
the somber shadows

25
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:36,194
All three of you, come back.

26
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,157
Roger.

27
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,060
Now...

28
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:43,029
Nanoha and Yuuno,

29
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,231
you'll both receive a very stern
lecture directly from me.

30
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:50,472
Everybody's Separate Heart-felt Vows

31
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:01,147
Following all instructions and
orders is a necessary rule

32
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,483
to protect an organization,
not just individuals.

33
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:07,186
Selfish decisions and actions
may have put not only you,

34
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:11,323
but everyone else around you
in danger as well.

35
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,259
You understand that, right?

36
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,192
Yes, ma'am...

37
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,162
Normally I would put a very
heavy punishment on you.

38
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:20,533
But as a result of what you did,
we have gained a little as well.

39
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,664
So, for this one time,
I will let it pass by.

40
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:26,449
However...

41
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,408
There will be no next time.

42
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,409
Understood?

43
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,277
Yes, ma'am.

44
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,079
We're very sorry.

45
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,182
Now, the problem is
what goes on from here.

46
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:40,519
Chrono, do you have any ideas
on the cause of all this?

47
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:41,454
Yes.

48
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,456
Amy, bring it up on the monitors!

49
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:44,507
Gotcha!

50
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:49,595
Oh...

51
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,596
That's right.

52
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:55,597
A mage from Midchilda,
just like us. Precia Testarossa.

53
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,772
Her specialty was development of
energy for interdimensional travel.

54
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:02,642
She was a grand mage, yet was exiled

55
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:05,073
due to causing an accident
through illegal research.

56
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:09,713
The wavelength of the magical attack
just now matches the data on file.

57
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:13,684
And that girl Fate is, most likely...

58
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:15,738
Fate...

59
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,779
Back then, she said "Mother"...

60
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:23,876
Mother?

61
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,943
Parent and child, huh...

62
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,366
Um...

63
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:34,851
She didn't look like she was
surprised so much as scared.

64
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,411
Amy!

65
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:42,215
Can you give me a bit more
detailed data on Lady Precia?

66
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:43,449
Where she went in exile,

67
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,219
her family makeup,
anything that you can find.

68
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,240
Aye aye. I'll look for them right away.

69
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,775
This is Fate's mother...

70
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,743
You had such a great chance
in front of you,

71
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,312
yet all you did was
stand there in a daze.

72
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,043
I'm sorry...

73
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,220
How horrible, Fate.

74
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:24,351
Do you really want to make
your mother that sad?

75
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,947
I want to be friends.

76
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,274
Precia Testarossa...

77
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:43,809
According to Mid history,
she was head of Sector 3

78
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,647
of the Central Technology
Development Office 26 years ago.

79
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,882
However, at the time,
she was developing

80
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:53,363
a dimension travel energy motor
called the Hudra,

81
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:57,791
where she conducted an experiment
using illegal materials, and failed.

82
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:04,664
Because it resulted in
a mid-size dimensional tremor,

83
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:07,325
she was forced to leave Central,
and was relocated to a rural branch.

84
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,703
There seems to have been
much debate about it.

85
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,571
She argued that only
the result was a failure,

86
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,002
and that there were no illegalities
in the experimental materials.

87
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:17,810
After being relocated to the outskirts,

88
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:21,514
she was involved in tech research
for several years.

89
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,974
After a while, she ended up missing...

90
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,287
And nothing ever since.

91
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:31,524
What about her family, and her
activities when she went missing?

92
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:34,864
All data concerning those questions
has been completely erased.

93
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,333
We're contacting headquarters now
to have them looked over.

94
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:42,301
How much time will it take?

95
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,112
I believe it will be in
the next day or two.

96
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,973
Neither Lady Precia
nor Fate should be able

97
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:52,104
to move around too much after
emitting so much magical power.

98
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,740
We have to use that time to
strengthen the Arthra's shields, too.

99
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:02,288
It's best that you two rest for a while.

100
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,923
Oh, but...

101
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,458
Especially you, Nanoha.

102
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:09,428
It's not good for you to be absent
from school for too long.

103
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,530
I will allow you to go home
for the time being.

104
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,499
It's better for you to
put in an appearance,

105
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,310
for both your family
and your schoolmates.

106
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,299
Yes, ma'am.

107
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,183
Fate! Fate!

108
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:30,965
Fate... Fate...

109
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:40,235
Only nine...

110
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,829
I can cause a dimensional
tremor with this many,

111
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,050
but I can't reach Alhazard.

112
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,342
I don't have much time left.

113
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,153
Neither for me, nor for Alicia...

114
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:43,022
You're her mother, and that girl
is your daughter, right?!

115
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,157
She's doing her best right now,

116
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,626
she's honestly trying so hard...

117
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:50,257
How can you be so cruel to her?!

118
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:08,881
She's terrible at making
a good familiar.

119
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,817
Too many excessive emotions...

120
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:16,522
Fate... Your daughter wants you
to smile so much,

121
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:19,683
wants you to be a kind person again,
and does so much...

122
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:26,065
You're in my way.

123
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,266
Begone!

124
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,880
It doesn't matter where.
I have to teleport!

125
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,248
I'm sorry, Fate...

126
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,739
Just for a little while, wait for me!

127
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:00,699
Fate...

128
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,600
Wake up, Fate.

129
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,671
Yes, Mother.

130
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:09,141
The number of Jewel Seeds
you have brought is nine.

131
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,143
This isn't enough.

132
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,212
I need at least five more.

133
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,114
If possible, even more than that.

134
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,215
Hurry and get them for your mother.

135
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,425
Yes...

136
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,489
Aruf?

137
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,360
Oh...

138
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,626
That girl ran away.

139
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,646
She said she was scared,
and had had enough.

140
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:34,533
If you need one, I'll get you
a better familiar.

141
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:38,737
Don't forget that your one
true ally is your mother.

142
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,198
Got that, Fate?

143
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:45,446
Yes, Mother.

144
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:52,151
And that's how it's been
for the past ten days.

145
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,920
Oh, I see!

146
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,522
Mrs. Lindy...

147
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,657
It's either a really great cover-up,

148
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,559
or a complete lie...

149
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,727
Amazing.

150
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:04,063
I can't tell them the truth.

151
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:07,434
Please say that it's me caring
enough to not worry your family.

152
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:12,605
However, Miss Nanoha
is an excellent child.

153
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:15,774
I really would like my child
to be more like her.

154
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,911
Oh, my... That's going too far!

155
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:21,780
My Chrono isn't good at
being kind to others.

156
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:22,948
Nanoha...

157
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,584
You can stay home for at least
the next day or two, right?

158
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:26,585
Yeah.

159
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:31,156
Arisa and Suzuka have been worried
too. Have you contacted them yet?

160
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,847
Yeah, I sent them e-mail a while ago.

161
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:44,626
And... send!

162
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,809
Miss Arisa, did you receive
some good news?

163
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,270
Not really. Just an ordinary e-mail.

164
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,059
Samejima, stop the car for a second!

165
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:13,932
It really was a big dog.

166
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:17,903
It's hunrt, as well.
The wounds look severe.

167
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,105
But it's still alive.

168
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,740
Samejima!

169
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,081
Understood.

170
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:28,664
Fate...

171
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,477
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha.

172
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,804
Oh, are you awake now?

173
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:00,713
This girl... I've seen her somewhere.

174
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:02,948
You're built really tough.

175
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,885
You were hurt so bad, but they said
your life wasn't in danger.

176
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:10,226
I'll take care of you until your
wounds are all healed up.

177
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:12,928
So rest easy.

178
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,953
It's that girl's friend.

179
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,779
Here. It's soft dog food.
Can you eat it?

180
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:39,072
There's nothing to worry about
if you have that much appetite.

181
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,236
After you eat, take your time,
rest, and get better soon.

182
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,759
Nanoha!

183
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,460
I'm so glad you're doing well!

184
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,921
Yeah! Thanks, Suzuka.

185
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:55,258
I'm sorry to you too, Arisa.
I made you worry.

186
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,553
Well, I'm glad you're doing okay.

187
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,276
I see... You have to go again.

188
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:05,377
Yeah...

189
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:06,608
That must be tough.

190
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,349
But it's all right!

191
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,600
What about after school? Will you
be able to play with us a little?

192
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:16,522
Yeah, it's okay.

193
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,323
Then, wanna come to my place?

194
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,058
I bought a few new games.

195
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,519
Oh, really?

196
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:25,764
That's right... Last night, I picked up
a dog that was hurt.

197
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:26,832
A dog?

198
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:31,336
Yeah. It's really big, with orange fur,

199
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:35,257
and on its forehead is
a red stone, like this.

200
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:46,752
Just as I thought...

201
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:47,653
It's you, Miss Aruf.

202
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:49,988
Is that you?

203
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,791
Those wounds...
What happened to you?

204
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:54,282
And what about Fate?

205
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,864
Oh, no, it's lost its energy.

206
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:00,933
What's wrong?
Are you doing all right?

207
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,684
Maybe its wounds hurt.

208
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:06,405
Maybe we should leave it alone?

209
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,366
Yeah.

210
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:09,808
Yuuno!

211
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,777
Hey, that's dangerous.

212
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,768
It's okay. Yuuno will be all right.

213
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:15,981
Nanoha...

214
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:19,084
I'll hear what she has to say.

215
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,053
Nanoha, you go with
Arisa and Suzuka.

216
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:21,854
Okay.

217
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,455
Then how about some tea?

218
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,157
I have a couple really
tasty tea snacks.

219
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,225
Yeah!

220
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:27,686
I'm looking forward to that!

221
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,564
What in the world happened?

222
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,995
Something happened
between you two?

223
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,605
The fact that you're here means that

224
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,608
the guys from the Bureau
are watching us now, right?

225
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,749
Yes.

226
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:48,013
Chrono Harlaown of the Time-Space
Administration Bureau here.

227
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,148
It seems like the situation
is very complex.

228
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,852
If you speak honestly, I will make
sure it doesn't work against you.

229
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:57,693
About you, and about your
master, Fate Testarossa.

230
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,049
I'll tell you everything.

231
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,465
But you have to promise me
that you will save Fate!

232
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,546
She hasn't done anything wrong!

233
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:10,569
I promise.

234
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,170
Amy, the recorder.

235
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,371
Already recording.

236
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:21,142
Fate's mother, Precia Testarossa,
is the cause of it all.

237
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:22,904
Hero takes 28 points of damage.

238
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:26,184
What you got a few minutes ago...
Correct. Here!

239
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,619
Which one?

240
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,955
Nanoha, did you hear that?

241
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:32,124
Yeah. I heard it all.

242
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,993
The conditions that you
have described to us...

243
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,262
And examining her familiar
Aruf's testimony,

244
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:39,631
as well as her current
physical condition...

245
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:43,101
It looks like there are no lies
or contradictions in her story.

246
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:45,203
What's going to happen now?

247
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:48,073
We're going to capture
Precia Testarossa.

248
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:50,609
Just the fact that she
attacked the Arthra

249
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,345
is more than enough reason
for us to arrest her.

250
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,448
So, as soon as we get orders
from the Captain,

251
00:16:56,449 --> 00:17:00,285
we will be forced to change our
mission to the arrest of Precia.

252
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,776
What will you do then,
Nanoha Takamachi?

253
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:06,094
L.

254
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:10,095
I want to save Fate.

255
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:14,266
Miss Aruf's feelings, and my own will.

256
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:18,937
A sad look on Fate's face
somehow makes me sad as well.

257
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:21,928
That's why I want to save her,
from all the sad things.

258
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:26,144
Besides, I told her that I wanted
to be friends with her.

259
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,105
I haven't heard her answer yet.

260
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,917
I understand.

261
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:36,421
We're also thankful to have your
magical powers on our side.

262
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:40,025
We'll leave everything concerning
Fate Testarossa up to you, Nanoha.

263
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,196
Is that all right?

264
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:45,964
Nanoha... was it?

265
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:49,685
I don't have the right to
ask you, but please...

266
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,043
Save Fate!

267
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,690
She really is all alone right now.

268
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:01,154
Yeah. It'll be all right. Leave it to me!

269
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,120
You're late, Nanoha!

270
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:11,251
Come on, we've been waiting for you
to enter the new dungeon!

271
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,259
Sorry, sorry!

272
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,561
Wow, this looks so cool!

273
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:20,332
As planned, our return to the Arthra
is set for tomorrow morning.

274
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:24,036
In the event that you
encounter Fate before then...

275
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:25,967
Yeah... It'll be all right.

276
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,209
I got really into that one!

277
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,646
After all, it's more fun when
you're with us, Nanoha.

278
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:35,907
Thanks.

279
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:39,217
I'm sure everything
will be over very soon.

280
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,678
And then everything will be all right.

281
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,049
Nanoha...

282
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:47,526
Hey, did you get over it, just a little?

283
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:51,596
Um, well... I don't know...

284
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,365
I was worried.

285
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:56,301
Actually, the reason why I was mad

286
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,071
wasn't because you were
hiding something from me,

287
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:01,540
or because you were always
thinking about something.

288
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:05,021
It was because you looked
troubled and confused.

289
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,579
And every so often...

290
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,782
You looked like you were
going to go somewhere,

291
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:13,392
and never come back
to see us ever again.

292
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,208
I won't be going anywhere.

293
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:27,299
You're my friends.

294
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,110
I wouldn't go anywhere!

295
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,059
I see.

296
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:38,043
Right.

297
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,594
I won't go anywhere.

298
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,413
I'lll make sure to
come back right here.

299
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,421
It's just that for a short time,

300
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,762
I'm going to spend my time
differently than usual.

301
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,659
So that in the future, I can live
a straightforward life as myself.

302
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:02,642
A small journey so that
I won't regret anything.

303
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:16,968
You're looking better now.

304
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,218
Are your worries gone now?

305
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,389
Dad?

306
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:25,490
You knew that I was
worried about something?

307
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,225
Of course I did.

308
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,476
I am your father, after all.

309
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:34,633
You're going to take off early
in the morning tomorrow, right?

310
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:38,236
Yeah. I'm sorry to trouble you.

311
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,106
Well, you're a strong girl, Nanoha.

312
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:43,708
I'm not all that worried.

313
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,049
Make sure to do your best!

314
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:48,143
Yeah!

315
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:59,625
Uminari city, residential district
Takamachi residence, 5:27AM

316
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:06,094
Nanoha!

317
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:22,114
Uminari Seaside Park, 5:55AM

318
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:33,625
It's all right if it's here, right?

319
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,846
Please come out, Fate!

320
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,470
Scythe Form.

321
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:03,421
Fate, let's stop all this now.

322
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:07,225
You shouldn't listen to what
that woman tells you!

323
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:11,263
Fate, you'll end up more and more
miserable if you keep going.

324
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:12,724
So please, Fate!

325
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:16,705
But still...

326
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,366
I'm still her daughter.

327
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,089
It's not good enough
to just throw it away.

328
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:40,392
And it's even worse if
I were to run away.

329
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:43,113
I'm sure it all started
with the Jewel Seeds.

330
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:48,900
So, both of us should risk every
Jewel Seed that we have!

331
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:50,071
Put out.

332
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:53,418
Put out.

333
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:57,976
That's where it starts.

334
00:22:57,977 --> 00:22:59,347
Where it all starts.

335
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,356
Nothing between us has even started.

336
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:14,787
So to start our true selves...

337
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,863
Let's begin...

338
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,084
Our first and last serious battle!

339
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:25,437
Make a little wish

340
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:30,238
Even though at times
I'll trip or get lost

341
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:41,194
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic

342
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,559
Ah, going over the sea of cellophane
and over the forests

343
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:57,068
Passing through the silver wind

344
00:23:57,069 --> 00:24:01,106
I was looking for something
neither of us had

345
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:06,107
Ah, I was just crying inside
a diorama of a city

346
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:12,913
Until I met that warm hand that
reached out to me that day

347
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:20,454
Among the swaying days,
I felt a strong gaze

348
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:27,661
Hey, I finally, finally
found the secret key

349
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,704
Make a little wish

350
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:37,304
Collecting the lemon-colored
drops from the moon

351
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:43,611
I want to keep a light shining
on the road that you travel down

352
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:47,385
Make a little wish
