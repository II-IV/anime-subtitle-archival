1
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:04,813
Under these vast skies,

2
00:00:05,406 --> 00:00:08,065
there are thousands - tens
of thousands of people.

3
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:11,978
All sorts of people live their lives,

4
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:13,318
harboring desires and
emotions of all sorts.

5
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:18,658
Those emotions sometimes touch one
another, and clash with one another.

6
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:25,124
But still, a few of them are sure
to bond to each other,

7
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,705
and can communicate
with one another.

8
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:32,842
Such a story is about to begin, one
of new introductions and contacts.

9
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:38,472
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha
is about to begin!

10
00:00:56,523 --> 00:01:00,460
Cradling my knees in
a corner of my room

11
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:03,997
I always shivered from uncertainty

12
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:08,997
I was scared of learning the truth,
so I closed the door

13
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:16,038
I found my own place within a kind lie
and I fled inside my dreams

14
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:23,379
I dye a sea of loneliness that
nobody knows of into a deep blue

15
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:31,954
An intense feeling to
hide the loneliness

16
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:37,726
Is continually injuring your heart

17
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:43,669
The secret hidden deep
within the eyes

18
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:48,207
To the truth behind the
smile that draws me in

19
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:53,208
I will deliver a love so soft

20
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:58,184
Right now, a warmth that might
break upon touching it

21
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:02,755
Parts itself from the past,
and overflows

22
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:07,326
I'll be by your side forever

23
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:16,387
Do not be lured into
the somber shadows

24
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:12,625
Ancient resonance, turn into light!

25
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:15,056
Put those that are unforgiven
inside the ring of sealing!

26
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,466
Jewel Seed, Seal!

27
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:39,935
I let it get away...

28
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,971
I have to go after it...

29
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:48,691
Someone...

30
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,050
Listen to my voice...

31
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,272
Lend me your powers!

32
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:57,658
Magical... powers...

33
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:18,459
Episode 1: Is This What You Call
A Mysterious Encounter?

34
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,989
That was a pretty strange
dream I just had.

35
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,160
I'm Nanoha Takamachi.

36
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,295
I'm a third grader at Seisho
Elementary, a private school.

37
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,996
I'm a third grader at Seisho
Elementary, a private school.

38
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:03,006
And in the Takamachi family,
I'm the youngest of three children.

39
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:05,671
Good morning!

40
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,252
Oh, Nanoha! Good morning!

41
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:09,508
Good morning, Nanoha.

42
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,310
Here, take these, please.

43
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,131
Okay.

44
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,396
These two are my father and mother.

45
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,384
You woke up all on your own!

46
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:19,435
Such a good girl.

47
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,590
This is Shiro Takamachi, my father.

48
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,590
He's the owner of Midoriya,

49
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,325
a café located across the street
from the train station,

50
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,026
and the main pillar of our household.

51
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,042
Breakfast is almost ready.

52
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,288
And my mother, Momoko Takamachi.

53
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:37,570
S I e Midoriya cafe 1ot

54
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:40,501
So beautiful and kind...
I love my mother!

55
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,277
By the way, Midoriya is located in
the middle of the shopping strip,

56
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:46,345
across the street from
the train station.

57
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,856
It prides itself on cakes, cream
puffs, and house-roasted coffee.

58
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,352
It's a favorite after-school
hangout for schoolgirls,

59
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,083
as well as for all the ladies
of the neighborhood.

60
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,020
Where's big brother and big sister?

61
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:00,663
They might be over at the dojo.

62
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:09,931
Big brother, big sister, good morning!
It's time for breakfast!

63
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:11,537
Morning.

64
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,639
Oh, Nanoha. Good morning.

65
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,370
Here.

66
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:16,309
Thanks.

67
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,240
These two are my older siblings.

68
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,007
Then that's it for this morning, Miyuki.

69
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:25,959
My big brother, Kyouya Takamachi,
is a freshman in college.

70
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,954
He's a swordsman following
in my dad's footsteps,

71
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,565
and acts as coach to my sister.

72
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,785
Okay. Then we'll continue once
I'm done with school for the day.

73
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:39,399
And my sister, Miyuki Takamachi,
is in 11th grade.

74
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,968
It's tasty as ever this morning!

75
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,271
Especially these scrambled eggs!

76
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:48,040
Really? I topped it with
tomatoes and cheese,

77
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,031
and a hint of basil to add to the flavor!

78
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:54,714
You're all really fortunate to have
such a great chef for a mother!

79
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:55,648
Do you guys understand that?

80
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,950
We get it. Right, Nanoha?

81
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:58,851
Yeah.

82
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:01,072
Oh, stop it, honey!

83
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,460
The parents of the Takamachi family
still act like newlyweds.

84
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,234
Miyuki, your ribbon is all twisted up.

85
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,030
Really?

86
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,598
Here, let me fix it.

87
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,435
And my big brother and big sister
get along really well...

88
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:20,973
But in such a loving family,

89
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:24,784
I think I'm a bit of
a third wheel at times.

90
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:32,418
Good morning!

91
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:33,649
Nanoha!

92
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,689
Nanoha! Over here!

93
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,469
Suzuka! Arisa!

94
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,059
Morning.

95
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,694
Good morning, Nanoha.

96
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:42,455
Good morning.

97
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,907
Arisa Bannings and Suzuka Tsukimura

98
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,658
have been in my class
since first grade.

99
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,037
And this year, the three of us go
to the same cram school too.

100
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:11,782
Just as I had you research, there
are many stores in this city.

101
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:16,028
Actually seeing and hearing
the behavior and cleverness

102
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,063
of all the people who
work in such stores

103
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:20,174
must have been a very
educational experience for you.

104
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:25,504
Just like this, there are various jobs
in all sorts of places,

105
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,135
so what kind of jobs would you
like to hold when you grow up?

106
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:32,035
It might be a good idea to
start thinking about that now.

107
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,257
Rise!

108
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:44,166
My future, huh...

109
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,994
Arisa, Suzuka,

110
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,630
you two have a good idea
of what you'll be, right?

111
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:55,568
Both Mom and Dad run a company,

112
00:08:55,569 --> 00:09:00,406
so I have to study a lot so
I can properly take over.

113
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,547
I like machines,

114
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:07,998
so I'm considering an
engineering specialty.

115
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,851
I see. Both of you are amazing.

116
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:14,952
Saherit Caré Mideriya?

117
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:19,983
That's one of the visions
of my future, but...

118
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:24,257
I have a feeling that there's
something else that I want to do,

119
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,591
but it's not really clear
what exactly that thing is.

120
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:31,804
I don't have any special
traits or talents.

121
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:32,795
You idiot!

122
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:36,075
Don't say that about yourself!

123
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,109
That's right.

124
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,079
I'm sure there is something
that only you can do, Nanoha.

125
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,447
In the first place,

126
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:44,683
your math and science grades
are better than mine!

127
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:49,134
So which mouth is blabbering that
she has no talents at all, huh?!

128
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,126
But I'm not good at Japanese,

129
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,906
and I'm terrible in physical education!

130
00:09:56,496 --> 00:10:00,336
Both of you, stop it... Come on...
Come on, already!

131
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,605
Something I can do...

132
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,915
Something only I can do?

133
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:15,080
You were amazing in
dodge-ball today, Suzuka.

134
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,949
Yeah, she was really awesome!

135
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,530
Oh, not at all...

136
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:20,726
Be quiet!

137
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:23,956
Over here!

138
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,567
Cutting through here is a shortcut!

139
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:28,843
Really?

140
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,329
The path is a bit rough, though.

141
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:52,456
This is the place I saw
in my dream last night.

142
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,920
Something wrong?

143
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:55,791
Nanoha?

144
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,657
No, it's nothing.

145
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,825
Sorry, sorry.

146
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:00,826
Are you all right?

147
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,027
Yeah.

148
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:02,878
Then let's go.

149
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:04,617
That's impossible.

150
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,799
Nanoha!

151
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,620
Yeah!

152
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:13,442
Help me!

153
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,610
Nanoha?

154
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:20,045
Did you hear something just now?

155
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,180
Something?

156
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,991
Like a voice.

157
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:24,817
Not really.

158
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:26,428
I don't think I heard anything.

159
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:35,531
Help me!

160
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,963
Nanoha!

161
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:38,924
Nanoha?!

162
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,630
I think it was from over here.

163
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:11,288
What's wrong, Nanoha?!
Running off so suddenly!

164
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,099
Look, an animal.

165
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,834
It looks like it's hurt.

166
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,585
Yeah... What should we do?

167
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:21,607
What should we do?
Maybe a hospital for starters?

168
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:22,675
You mean a veterinarian's office!

169
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:26,378
Was there a vet's office around here?

170
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,914
Let's see... Around here...

171
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,905
Wait, I'll try calling home.

172
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,971
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha!

173
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:40,392
Nanoha!

174
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:40,826
Nanoha!

175
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:41,360
Nanoha!

176
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:42,728
Hey, Nanoha!

177
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,569
Okay, I'm coming right over!

178
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,638
The wounds weren't that bad,

179
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,719
but it seems to be
very weak right now.

180
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,944
Maybe it's been on its own for a while.

181
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,780
Thank you so much, Doctor!

182
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,981
Thank you very much!

183
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,673
Oh, you're welcome!

184
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:12,029
Doctor, this is a ferret, right?

185
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,227
I wonder if it was someone's pet?

186
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,296
Is it a ferret?

187
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,298
It's a strange breed if it is.

188
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,334
And on the collar...

189
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,175
Is this a gem?

190
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:27,913
It woke up!

191
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,521
It's looking...

192
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:43,605
Nanoha, it's looking at you.

193
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:45,516
Yeah...

194
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,542
Um... um...

195
00:13:57,737 --> 00:14:00,706
It's best to let it rest for a while,

196
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:03,016
so I'll take care of it
here until tomorrow.

197
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:07,452
Yes, please do!

198
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:11,784
So come by again tomorrow
to see how it's doing, okay?

199
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:12,985
Yes, we will!

200
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,420
Oh no, it's time for cram school!

201
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,355
You're right!

202
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,786
Then, Doctor, excuse us...
We'll be back tomorrow!

203
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,689
Well, let's start with an application
of what we learned last time.

204
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,660
Starting from the top of
page 47 of the textbook.

205
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:31,870
Let's look at the sample problem.

206
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,237
What should we do with this guy? -N
Let's look at the sample problem.

207
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:32,905
What should we do with this guy? -N

208
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:33,472
What should we do with this guy? -N
The sample problem says 3945.

209
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:36,308
The sample problem says 3945.

210
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:36,809
We have dogs running around
in our backyard... -A
The sample problem says 3945.

211
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,010
We have dogs running around
in our backyard... -A

212
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:38,977
We have dogs running around
in our backyard... -A
Both the numerator and denominator
can be divided by three.

213
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,746
Both the numerator and denominator
can be divided by three.

214
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:41,747
So it can be reduced to 1315.

215
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,081
We have cats in our house too. -S
So it can be reduced to 1315.

216
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:43,752
We have cats in our house too. -S

217
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:47,152
We handle food as our business,

218
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:49,813
so raising pets is basically
out of the question.

219
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,890
Then let's have the answer to
this question answered by...

220
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,633
Okay, %29, Miss Takamachi.

221
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:57,763
Okay!

222
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,132
Problem 3, on page 47!

223
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:03,101
Let's see... Let's see...

224
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,037
5742!

225
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,088
Yes, that's correct.

226
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,175
Some people stop here, thinking
they've solved the problem,

227
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,109
Good going!
Some people stop here, thinking
they've solved the problem,

228
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,443
Nice!
Some people stop here, thinking
they've solved the problem,

229
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:12,044
Nice!
but in this case...

230
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:12,714
but in this case...

231
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,592
I'll talk to my family to see
if we can do something.

232
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,224
And so, that's the reason
why I was wondering

233
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:28,325
if we can take care of
that ferret for a while.

234
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:30,749
A ferret, huh?

235
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,579
By the way, what's a ferret?

236
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,673
It's an animal related
to a weasel, Dad.

237
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:43,041
It's an animal that's been popular
as a pet for quite a while now.

238
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,210
Ferrets are small critters, right?

239
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,031
You know about them?

240
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,614
It was about this big.

241
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,849
If it's for a short while...

242
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,385
If you keep it in a cage,
and take proper care of it,

243
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:54,953
I don't mind.

244
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,555
Kyouya, Miyuki, what do you think?

245
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,306
I don't have any problems with it.

246
00:15:58,892 --> 00:15:59,912
Neither do I.

247
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:02,861
And that's that.

248
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:03,682
Isn't that nice?

249
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,221
Yeah! Thank you!

250
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,968
Now, eat up before it gets cold.

251
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,036
Okay!

252
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:12,871
Momoko, can you pass me the salad?

253
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:14,006
Sure, here you go.

254
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:14,506
Me too.

255
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:15,040
Coming!
Me too.

256
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:15,421
Coming!

257
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:21,013
Arisa, Suzuka,

258
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:24,549
I have permission to raise
the little guy in our house.

259
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:29,240
Let's go pick it up together after
school tomorrow. --Nanoha

260
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,876
And... sent!

261
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,904
Can you hear me?

262
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:48,275
Can you hear my voice?

263
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:54,514
The same voice as last night's
dream, and this afternoon...

264
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,175
Please listen to me.

265
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:03,735
You can hear my voice.

266
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,760
Please, lend me just
a small bit of your powers!

267
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,658
Is the little guy talking to me?

268
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,847
Please, come to me!

269
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,597
Time is... Danger is now...

270
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,728
Please reach her!

271
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:48,803
Makihara Veterinary

272
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:02,977
That sound again?!

273
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:28,650
That was...

274
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,270
What?! What in the
world is going on?!

275
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,922
You came for me?

276
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,358
It talked!

277
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:10,382
Well... I really don't know
what's going on here.

278
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,493
What in the world was that?
What's going on?!

279
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,487
You have talent.

280
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:19,091
Please, lend me just
a small bit of your powers.

281
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:20,492
Talent?

282
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,028
I came here from a different world,

283
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,759
in order to search for
a certain something.

284
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,991
But I might not be able to fulfill
that wish with my powers alone.

285
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:33,038
So, I know this will
be a burden for you,

286
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,969
but I want people with
talent to help me out.

287
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,459
I will reward you. I will make sure to!

288
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:42,022
I want you to use
the powers that I have!

289
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,792
My powers.... The powers of magic!

290
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:47,601
Magic?

291
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,297
I will make sure to reward you!

292
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,468
This is no time to be talking
about rewards and stuff!

293
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:06,838
What should I do?!

294
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:07,629
Take this!

295
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:11,676
It's warm.

296
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:15,180
Hold it, close your eyes,
and open your heart.

297
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:16,931
Repeat after me.

298
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:23,235
Okay? Here goes!

299
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,050
Yeah.

300
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,840
I am the one who has
been given a mission.

301
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,305
I am the one who has
been given a mission.

302
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,254
Under the contract,
release those powers.

303
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:42,216
Um... Under the contract,
release those powers.

304
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,646
Winds to the sky,
stars to the heavens.

305
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:49,927
Winds to the sky,
stars to the heavens.

306
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,919
And the unyielding soul...

307
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,850
And the unyielding soul...

308
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,001
To this heart!

309
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,221
Magic to these hands!

310
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:08,064
Raging Heart, set up!

311
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,200
Stand by ready. Set up.

312
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:26,914
What magical power!

313
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,188
Calm down and imagine,

314
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:32,999
a magical wand that will
control your powers,

315
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:37,262
and a sturdy armor
that will protect you!

316
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:39,864
You say that, but everything
being so sudden...

317
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,205
Let's see... let's see...

318
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:49,694
I think this will do for now!

319
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:00,071
Success!

320
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,629
What? What? You're kidding!

321
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,534
What is all this?!

322
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:21,212
What?!

323
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:25,270
Make a little wish

324
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:30,101
Even though at times
I'll trip or get lost

325
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:41,077
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic

326
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:51,425
Ah, going over the sea of
cellophane and over the forests

327
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,935
Passing through the silver wind

328
00:23:56,936 --> 00:24:00,972
I was looking for something
neither of us had

329
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:05,973
Ah, I was just crying
inside a diorama of a city

330
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:12,780
Until I met that warm hand that
reached out to me that day

331
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:20,321
Among the swaying days,
I felt a strong gaze

332
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:27,495
Hey, I finally, finally
found the secret key

333
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:32,537
Make a little wish

334
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:37,168
Collecting the lemon-colored
drops from the moon

335
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:43,477
I want to keep a light shining on
the road that you travel down

336
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:47,085
Make a little wish

337
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:51,886
I wonder if there is something I
can do even though I'm so little

338
00:24:52,925 --> 00:25:03,215
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic

339
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,077
I'm Nanoha Takamachi.

340
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:16,614
I thought I was an
ordinary third grader,

341
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,516
but by some stroke of luck
or strange destiny,

342
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,052
I've been assigned as a magical girl!

343
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,087
What kind of fate awaits me now?

344
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:26,391
And this ferret, whose name
I haven't even asked,

345
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:28,262
is it all right for me to
raise it at my house?!
