1
00:00:03,835 --> 00:00:07,939
It was a small incident that happened
to me, Nanoha Takamachi,

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,870
a girl who was supposed to be
an ordinary third-grader.

3
00:00:11,877 --> 00:00:15,947
I accepted the heart of courage,
and I gained magical powers.

4
00:00:17,182 --> 00:00:19,317
Destiny starts to move once again,

5
00:00:19,318 --> 00:00:20,718
thanks to yet another
new introduction.

6
00:00:21,753 --> 00:00:23,887
A small light shining on one's feelings

7
00:00:23,889 --> 00:00:26,424
while walking through
the forest of hesitation

8
00:00:26,425 --> 00:00:28,855
is most likely found in one's heart.

9
00:00:29,594 --> 00:00:32,296
Because I decided to believe,
and move forward,

10
00:00:32,296 --> 00:00:35,137
even if I am headed towards
a shadowed sky.

11
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:40,102
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha
is about to begin!

12
00:00:58,223 --> 00:01:02,360
Cradling my knees in
a corner of my room

13
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:05,562
I always shivered from uncertainty

14
00:01:05,564 --> 00:01:10,564
I was scared of learning the truth,
so I closed the door

15
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:17,771
I found my own place within a kind lie
and I fled inside my dreams

16
00:01:20,278 --> 00:01:25,278
I dye a sea of loneliness that
nobody knows of into a deep blue

17
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,520
An intense feeling to
hide the loneliness

18
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:39,459
Is continually injuring your heart

19
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:45,402
The secret hidden deep
within the eyes

20
00:01:45,404 --> 00:01:49,940
To the truth behind the smile
that draws me in

21
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:54,941
I will deliver a love so soft

22
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,884
Right now, a warmth that might
break upon touching it

23
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:04,488
Parts itself from the past,
and overflows

24
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:09,025
I'll be by your side forever

25
00:02:09,026 --> 00:02:18,087
Do not be lured into
the somber shadows

26
00:02:32,717 --> 00:02:35,937
The battle between the two
has already started on-site.

27
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:40,219
The Lost Logia in the
center of it is Class A+.

28
00:02:41,059 --> 00:02:42,560
Its mannerisms are quite unstable.

29
00:02:42,561 --> 00:02:44,521
It's showing signs of an
indiscriminate attack.

30
00:02:45,697 --> 00:02:48,499
A taboo item that meddles
with time and space...

31
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,900
We must hurry in its collection.

32
00:02:50,902 --> 00:02:53,302
Enforcer Chrono Harlaown,
can you head out?

33
00:02:54,339 --> 00:02:56,607
I have determined the
transfer coordinates.

34
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:58,642
I can go at any time, given the orders.

35
00:02:58,643 --> 00:02:59,844
Then, Chrono,

36
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:03,013
stop the battle on-site immediately,

37
00:03:03,014 --> 00:03:05,082
collect the Lost Logia,

38
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,484
and get a detailed report
from both combatants!

39
00:03:07,486 --> 00:03:08,826
Roger that, Captain!

40
00:03:12,891 --> 00:03:14,291
Oh, and be careful!

41
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,670
Okay... I'll be going now.

42
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:35,345
Episode 8:
There's a Really Big Crisis?

43
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,590
Stop!

44
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:01,851
Combat here is too dangerous.

45
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:07,178
Time-Space Administration
Bureau Enforcer,

46
00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:08,469
Chrono Harlaown.

47
00:04:09,447 --> 00:04:11,287
Would you tell me the
details of this case?

48
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:15,282
Time-Space Administration Bureau?

49
00:04:17,956 --> 00:04:19,796
First off, both of you,
stow your weapons.

50
00:04:23,695 --> 00:04:25,745
If you were to continue fighting...

51
00:04:38,109 --> 00:04:40,479
Fate, we're going to retreat!
Step away!

52
00:05:03,735 --> 00:05:04,695
Fate!

53
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,530
Fate!

54
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:17,580
No!

55
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,630
Stop! Don't shoot!

56
00:05:21,853 --> 00:05:24,253
We're gonna get outta here, Fate.
Hold on tight!

57
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:44,508
The fighting has stopped.

58
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:46,777
One of the two combatants
has escaped.

59
00:05:46,778 --> 00:05:48,178
Pursuit?

60
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:51,369
They are fleeing using multiple
teleports. We can't keep up.

61
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:53,367
I see.

62
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:02,593
Well, the battle was stopped quickly,

63
00:06:02,594 --> 00:06:04,704
and we've finished
securing the Lost Logia,

64
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:07,131
so I will say that was good enough.

65
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:09,242
And we'll be able to hear
about the situation.

66
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:14,905
Chrono, well done.

67
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:17,806
I'm sorry. I let one of them get away.

68
00:06:19,144 --> 00:06:20,678
It's all right.

69
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:23,580
You know, I'd like to hear
some of the story,

70
00:06:23,581 --> 00:06:27,217
so can you guide those kids
aboard the Arthra?

71
00:06:27,218 --> 00:06:29,388
Roger that. I'll return immediately.

72
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:46,070
Yuuno...

73
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:48,872
Yuuno, what in the world is this?

74
00:06:48,873 --> 00:06:50,574
This is inside a dimensional transport

75
00:06:50,575 --> 00:06:52,776
owned by the Time-Space
Administration Bureau.

76
00:06:52,777 --> 00:06:56,814
Well, to put it simply, it's a ship
that can freely move

77
00:06:56,815 --> 00:06:59,275
through the many dimensions
that exist in this world.

78
00:07:00,318 --> 00:07:03,248
I don't think that's really simple.

79
00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:05,723
Let's see...

80
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:08,058
Other than the world
that you live in, Nanoha,

81
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:10,361
there are many other worlds,

82
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:12,412
and my world is one of them.

83
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:15,866
This ship can cross
between those worlds.

84
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:19,269
And it's them, the Time-Space
Administration Bureau,

85
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,072
that controls events that
affect those worlds.

86
00:07:22,073 --> 00:07:23,183
I see.

87
00:07:28,346 --> 00:07:31,506
You must be uncomfortable wearing
that outfit for such a long time.

88
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:35,361
You can release your
barrier jacket and device.

89
00:07:36,354 --> 00:07:37,688
I see.

90
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:40,059
You're right. Then...

91
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:48,799
And you... I think it's okay for you
to return to your normal form.

92
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,435
Yeah... Come to think of it,
that makes sense.

93
00:07:51,436 --> 00:07:53,746
I've been in this form all this time,
so I had forgotten.

94
00:08:05,283 --> 00:08:08,413
It's been a while since you've
seen me in this form, Nanoha.

95
00:08:13,758 --> 00:08:15,597
What?!

96
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:19,029
Nanoha?

97
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,898
Yuuno... Yuuno...

98
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:22,900
Um, well, what...

99
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:24,861
But... You're kidding!

100
00:08:26,971 --> 00:08:30,941
Are you two having
a difference of opinion?

101
00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:33,444
Hey, Nanoha?

102
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:37,481
When we first met,
wasn't I in this form?

103
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:41,261
No, no! You were a ferret all along!

104
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:53,363
That's right, that's true!

105
00:08:53,364 --> 00:08:54,865
Sorry about that.

106
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:57,000
I haven't shown you this form yet!

107
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:58,936
Right? You haven't, right?

108
00:08:58,937 --> 00:09:00,577
You surprised me...

109
00:09:01,973 --> 00:09:03,522
Er, can I have a moment?

110
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:06,709
I am not aware of
what's going on here,

111
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:09,213
but the Captain's waiting on us,

112
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:11,782
and if it's at all possible,
we'd like to hear your story quickly.

113
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:13,817
Oh... Sure...

114
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:15,118
I'm sorry.

115
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,489
This way, then.

116
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:21,908
Captain, I have brought them here.

117
00:09:34,739 --> 00:09:36,106
You must be tired!

118
00:09:36,107 --> 00:09:39,387
Well, both of you, please,
over here. Relax!

119
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,250
Please.

120
00:09:44,782 --> 00:09:45,632
Okay...

121
00:09:47,318 --> 00:09:49,488
I see, that's how it was.

122
00:09:50,421 --> 00:09:51,989
The Lost Logia...

123
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,680
You were the one that
unearthed the Jewel Seeds.

124
00:09:56,394 --> 00:09:59,029
That's why I was trying
to collect them.

125
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,397
How admirable.

126
00:10:00,398 --> 00:10:02,508
But, at the same time, very reckless!

127
00:10:05,503 --> 00:10:08,939
Um... What exactly
are the Lost Logia?

128
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,508
They're legacies from
the lost worlds...

129
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:13,911
But you don't understand
that, do you?

130
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:15,022
Let's see...

131
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:20,784
In the dimensional universe,
there are many worlds.

132
00:10:20,785 --> 00:10:23,954
Each a world born unto its own,
and growing on its own.

133
00:10:23,955 --> 00:10:27,875
Among them, very rarely, there
are worlds that evolve too much.

134
00:10:29,394 --> 00:10:32,596
Technology and science... when
their evolution proves too great,

135
00:10:32,597 --> 00:10:35,432
they destroy their own world.

136
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:37,167
And what's left over afterwards

137
00:10:37,168 --> 00:10:40,128
are dangerous legacies of
the lost world's technology.

138
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:47,529
We generically call
such things Lost Logia.

139
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:52,282
How to use them is unclear,

140
00:10:52,283 --> 00:10:54,952
but depending on how they're used,
they can destroy a world,

141
00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:58,221
or even the dimensional
universe itself.

142
00:10:58,222 --> 00:10:59,682
Dangerous pieces of technology.

143
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:02,292
Items that need to be stored

144
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:05,923
in suitable locations, following
proper procedures...

145
00:11:06,965 --> 00:11:10,968
The Lost Logia you are
searching for, the Jewel Seeds,

146
00:11:10,969 --> 00:11:13,579
are energy crystals that
interact with the dimensions.

147
00:11:14,272 --> 00:11:18,041
If you collect a few and execute them
in a certain manner,

148
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:20,377
you can create a dimensional tremor
within the spatial area,

149
00:11:20,378 --> 00:11:23,478
and, in the worst case, even
a severance of dimensions.

150
00:11:24,248 --> 00:11:25,949
The tremor and explosion

151
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:29,286
that occurred when you clashed
with that black-clad mage...

152
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:30,867
That was a dimensional tremor.

153
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:40,464
Just one Jewel Seed executing

154
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:43,266
at a tiny fraction, one ten thousandth,
of full strength

155
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:45,469
had that much effect on the world.

156
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,973
It's impossible to gauge the effect
several of them might have together.

157
00:11:49,974 --> 00:11:51,975
I heard about that once.

158
00:11:51,976 --> 00:11:54,344
Back in the year 462
under the old calendar,

159
00:11:54,345 --> 00:11:56,980
when there was
a severance of dimensions...

160
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:59,916
Yeah, that was a horrible incident.

161
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:03,520
Many neighboring parallel
worlds fell to ruin.

162
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:05,361
A tragedy that left its mark on history.

163
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:29,699
We can't let it happen again.

164
00:12:35,953 --> 00:12:39,956
From here on, the retrieval of
the Lost Logia, the Jewel Seeds,

165
00:12:39,957 --> 00:12:42,297
will be performed by the
Time-Space Administration Bureau.

166
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:45,929
You guys should just
forget this incident,

167
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,364
return to your respective worlds,

168
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:48,945
and go back to your normal lives.

169
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:52,169
But... That's so...

170
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,471
This case concerns interaction
between dimensions.

171
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:57,407
It's far worse than one where
a civilian could meddle.

172
00:12:57,408 --> 00:12:58,475
But...

173
00:12:58,476 --> 00:13:02,345
Well, I'm sure you can't straighten
out your feelings so suddenly.

174
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:04,681
Take your time, sleep on it tonight,

175
00:13:04,682 --> 00:13:06,149
talk it out between you two,

176
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,618
and we'll discuss it again afterwards.

177
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:11,019
I'll see you out. Is where
I found you all right?

178
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:15,168
Sure.

179
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,631
Should we go home for now?

180
00:13:21,632 --> 00:13:23,333
Yeah.

181
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:26,169
Um... are you about my age?

182
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,219
Yeah, probably.

183
00:13:29,073 --> 00:13:32,409
Well... you're not mad at me, are you?

184
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,378
I didn't mean to end up
this way, but...

185
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:37,279
It looked like I was keeping
it a secret from you.

186
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:39,516
Oh, not at all.

187
00:13:39,517 --> 00:13:42,419
I was surprised, but that was it.

188
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,760
I'm sorry. Thanks.

189
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:48,398
But for now...

190
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,135
I think it's better for me to be
in this form for everyday stuff.

191
00:13:58,136 --> 00:14:00,036
Yeah, you're right.

192
00:14:00,037 --> 00:14:03,507
Let's have dinner, and
then think it out properly.

193
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:05,348
What to do from here...

194
00:14:23,394 --> 00:14:25,061
So amazing!

195
00:14:25,062 --> 00:14:28,165
Both of them are AAA class mages.

196
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,216
Yeah...

197
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:34,204
This girl in the white outfit is cute.
She seems like your type, Chrono.

198
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:35,739
Amy!

199
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,108
That stuff doesn't matter right now!

200
00:14:38,109 --> 00:14:42,078
This girl's average magical
power is 1.27 million.

201
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,681
The girl in the black outfit
has 1.43 million.

202
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:47,722
Their maximum execution power
is more than triple that.

203
00:14:48,486 --> 00:14:52,122
If it's just about magical power,
they out-power you, Chrono.

204
00:14:52,123 --> 00:14:55,225
Magic is not about the quantity
of your magical power.

205
00:14:55,226 --> 00:14:57,194
You need adaptation
to suit the situation,

206
00:14:57,195 --> 00:15:00,197
and decision-making skills
to use them properly!

207
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:03,133
Of course, I trust you on that front.

208
00:15:03,134 --> 00:15:05,794
Chrono, you're the
Arthra's trump card!

209
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:11,998
Captain...

210
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,615
Oh, the data for those two.

211
00:15:18,616 --> 00:15:19,406
Yes.

212
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:26,389
Certainly, these are amazing girls.

213
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:30,160
If this much magical power
was poured into a Lost Logia,

214
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:32,529
I can understand why
a dimensional tremor would occur.

215
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:36,566
Now we know the reason why
those kids, Nanoha and Yuuno,

216
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:39,536
are collecting the Jewel Seeds.

217
00:15:39,537 --> 00:15:42,572
But I wonder what the
black-clad girl's reasons are?

218
00:15:42,573 --> 00:15:44,913
She seemed to be rather
desperate about it.

219
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,430
Perhaps she has a very strong motive.

220
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,857
Motive, huh...

221
00:15:54,252 --> 00:15:56,031
She's still a young child, right?

222
00:15:56,754 --> 00:15:58,488
If she has been leading a normal life,

223
00:15:58,489 --> 00:16:01,359
I'm sure she's young enough to
want to be spoiled by her mom.

224
00:16:16,741 --> 00:16:17,874
You can't!

225
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,143
If the Time-Space Administration
Bureau has stepped in,

226
00:16:20,144 --> 00:16:21,694
we can't do anything about it!

227
00:16:22,413 --> 00:16:25,133
Let's make a run for it.
The two of us, somewhere...

228
00:16:26,217 --> 00:16:28,385
We can't do that.

229
00:16:28,386 --> 00:16:29,386
But!

230
00:16:29,387 --> 00:16:31,187
It would have been fine
if he was a wimp,

231
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:33,490
but that was a first-class mage!

232
00:16:33,491 --> 00:16:35,258
If he starts a serious investigation,

233
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:38,528
we don't know how long we have
before he finds us here.

234
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:41,564
That old hag, your mom,

235
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:44,267
keeps muttering things
that make no sense,

236
00:16:44,268 --> 00:16:46,378
and she keeps doing
horrible things to you, Fate.

237
00:16:47,838 --> 00:16:50,807
Don't say bad things about Mother.

238
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:52,208
I will too!

239
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:54,959
Because I'm worried about you, Fate!

240
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,914
When you're sad,

241
00:16:57,915 --> 00:17:01,184
my heart hurts so much that
it's like being torn apart!

242
00:17:01,185 --> 00:17:04,854
When you're crying, my eyes
and the back of my nose sting,

243
00:17:04,855 --> 00:17:07,190
and I can't do anything about it!

244
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:11,231
I don't like it when you're crying
or grieving over something!

245
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:19,665
Our spirits are linked together,
just a little, Aruf.

246
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,004
I'm sorry.

247
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:22,605
If it's hurting you,

248
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:25,445
I won't feel sad anymore,
and I won't cry again.

249
00:17:28,445 --> 00:17:33,446
All I want is for you to
smile and be happy, Fate!

250
00:17:33,918 --> 00:17:37,487
Why... Why won't you
understand that?

251
00:17:37,488 --> 00:17:39,008
Thank you, Aruf.

252
00:17:39,623 --> 00:17:43,633
But I want to fulfill Mother's wishes.

253
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:49,032
It's not just for Mother.
I'm sure it's for myself as well.

254
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:51,253
So, just a little bit longer...

255
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:53,999
It's only a little more until the end.

256
00:17:54,605 --> 00:17:56,415
Will you do your best with me?

257
00:17:58,576 --> 00:18:00,643
Promise me.

258
00:18:00,644 --> 00:18:03,013
That you're not just
following her orders.

259
00:18:03,014 --> 00:18:07,283
That you'll be doing your best
for yourself, for your sake.

260
00:18:07,284 --> 00:18:10,414
If you can promise that,
I'll protect you no matter what.

261
00:18:27,271 --> 00:18:28,438
And so...

262
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:31,509
Both Nanoha and I would like
to assist your operations.

263
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,310
Assist, huh?

264
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:38,348
Leaving me aside, I believe
that Nanoha's magical powers

265
00:18:38,349 --> 00:18:41,384
can be a useful combat
force from your end.

266
00:18:41,385 --> 00:18:44,754
Collecting the Jewel Seeds,
fighting those girls...

267
00:18:44,755 --> 00:18:48,185
In either case, I'm sure we
can be very useful to you.

268
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,028
You've thought it out quite well.

269
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:53,863
In that case, I guess
it will be all right.

270
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:55,398
Moth...

271
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:56,833
Captain?!

272
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:58,768
Let's have them help us.

273
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:01,869
We would like to save our
own trump card as well.

274
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,210
Right, Enforcer Chrono?

275
00:19:05,476 --> 00:19:06,466
Yes, ma'am...

276
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:12,348
I have two conditions.

277
00:19:12,349 --> 00:19:14,084
Both of you need to be
under the custody of

278
00:19:14,085 --> 00:19:17,087
the Time-Space Administration
Bureau during this period.

279
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:19,398
That, and you must obey
every order given to you.

280
00:19:20,424 --> 00:19:21,564
Got it?

281
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,600
Understood.

282
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:33,676
Nanoha, it's been decided.

283
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,849
Thank you, Yuuno.

284
00:19:37,641 --> 00:19:40,610
Now, then... Momoko, Nanoha,

285
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:43,947
we're going to go out to the hill
in the backyard for a little bit.

286
00:19:43,948 --> 00:19:45,949
Sure. Practicing again tonight?

287
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,850
Yeah.

288
00:19:46,851 --> 00:19:48,384
Be careful!

289
00:19:48,385 --> 00:19:49,452
Right.

290
00:19:49,453 --> 00:19:50,386
Okay, let's go.

291
00:19:50,387 --> 00:19:51,121
Sure!

292
00:19:51,122 --> 00:19:51,387
It's been a while,
Sure!

293
00:19:51,388 --> 00:19:52,489
It's been a while,

294
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,860
so I'm going to give you a work-out!

295
00:19:55,392 --> 00:19:57,427
Hey, wait!

296
00:19:57,428 --> 00:19:58,728
I'm going to come watch!

297
00:19:58,729 --> 00:19:59,963
If you're coming, hurry up!

298
00:19:59,964 --> 00:20:01,833
Okay! Just a second...

299
00:20:03,934 --> 00:20:05,684
Miyuki, you haven't changed a bit.

300
00:20:09,607 --> 00:20:11,417
Okay, that should be it.

301
00:20:12,743 --> 00:20:13,592
Yeah.

302
00:20:14,411 --> 00:20:17,691
Now then, what is this important
thing you have to tell me about?

303
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:20,277
Yeah...

304
00:20:24,522 --> 00:20:28,124
What I told Mom was basically
everything that has happened

305
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,926
from when I met Yuuno until today.

306
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:33,663
But I couldn't tell her about the magic
or what Yuuno looks like,

307
00:20:33,664 --> 00:20:36,099
so I told her what I could,

308
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,939
and that I have to leave for a while
to do what I need to do.

309
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,670
It might be dangerous,

310
00:20:46,911 --> 00:20:49,579
but it's something I started
with a dear friend,

311
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,749
and I want to do it until the very end.

312
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,710
Right.

313
00:20:54,752 --> 00:20:57,331
I might make you all worry.

314
00:20:58,422 --> 00:21:02,058
But of course, I'm always
worried about you!

315
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:05,899
I'm your mother, Nanoha,
so I worry about you a lot.

316
00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:10,200
But...

317
00:21:10,201 --> 00:21:13,169
If you were still trying to decide
on which path to take,

318
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:16,506
I would say that you shouldn't
do anything dangerous.

319
00:21:16,507 --> 00:21:19,442
But you've already made up
your mind, right?

320
00:21:19,443 --> 00:21:23,913
To properly finish what you
started with your friend.

321
00:21:23,914 --> 00:21:28,044
To talk things out once more
with that girl you met.

322
00:21:29,553 --> 00:21:30,520
Yeah.

323
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:31,921
Then take care.

324
00:21:32,623 --> 00:21:34,203
So that you won't regret it.

325
00:21:34,925 --> 00:21:38,495
I'll convince your father
and brother for you.

326
00:21:40,531 --> 00:21:42,261
Thank you, Mom!

327
00:22:11,128 --> 00:22:13,129
I can't turn back now.

328
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,164
This is the path I chose for myself.

329
00:22:15,165 --> 00:22:17,185
This is what I really want to do.

330
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,248
Hurry...

331
00:23:05,249 --> 00:23:07,329
Hurry up, Fate.

332
00:23:11,622 --> 00:23:14,290
The promised land...

333
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:16,726
Alhazard is waiting for me.

334
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:20,067
The land of my... our... salvation.

335
00:23:26,136 --> 00:23:27,070
Make a little wish

336
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:31,870
Even though at times
I'll trip or get lost

337
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:42,860
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic

338
00:23:48,225 --> 00:23:53,225
Ah, going over the sea of cellophane
and over the forests

339
00:23:55,032 --> 00:23:58,701
Passing through the silver wind

340
00:23:58,702 --> 00:24:02,772
I was looking for something
neither of us had

341
00:24:02,773 --> 00:24:07,773
Ah, I was just crying inside
a diorama of a city

342
00:24:09,747 --> 00:24:14,747
Until I met that warm hand that
reached out to me that day

343
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:22,121
Among the swaying days,
I felt a strong gaze

344
00:24:24,294 --> 00:24:29,294
Hey, I finally, finally
found the secret key

345
00:24:32,703 --> 00:24:34,337
Make a little wish

346
00:24:34,338 --> 00:24:38,968
Collecting the lemon-colored
drops from the moon

347
00:24:40,277 --> 00:24:45,277
I want to keep a light shining
on the road that you travel down

348
00:24:47,351 --> 00:24:48,851
Make a little wish

349
00:24:48,852 --> 00:24:53,682
I wonder if there is something
I can do even though I'm so little

350
00:24:54,725 --> 00:25:05,014
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic

351
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:16,412
The flagship of the Time-Space
