1
00:00:04,602 --> 00:00:08,738
It was a small incident that happened
to me, Nanoha Takamachi,

2
00:00:08,739 --> 00:00:11,779
a girl who was supposed to be
an ordinary third-grader.

3
00:00:12,843 --> 00:00:16,823
I believed in the heart of courage,
and I gained magical powers.

4
00:00:18,316 --> 00:00:21,336
I wished for a very small feeling
to reach its destination.

5
00:00:22,653 --> 00:00:26,622
The beginning of the journey
must always be so sad,

6
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:29,554
but I'm sure the feelings
have gotten across.

7
00:00:30,962 --> 00:00:34,682
So I'm sure goodbye is
the word that begins something.

8
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:40,044
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha
is about to begin!

9
00:00:58,322 --> 00:01:02,258
Cradling my knees in
a corner of my room

10
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:05,628
I always shivered from uncertainty

11
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:10,629
I was scared of learning the truth,
so I closed the door

12
00:01:12,837 --> 00:01:17,837
I found my own place within a kind lie
and I fled inside my dreams

13
00:01:20,344 --> 00:01:25,344
I dye a sea of loneliness that
nobody knows of into a deep blue

14
00:01:28,586 --> 00:01:33,586
An intense feeling to
hide the loneliness

15
00:01:34,525 --> 00:01:39,525
Is continually injuring your heart

16
00:01:40,798 --> 00:01:45,467
The secret hidden deep
within the eyes

17
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:50,039
To the truth behind the smile
that draws me in

18
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:55,041
I will deliver a love so soft

19
00:01:55,446 --> 00:01:59,982
Right now, a warmth that might
break upon touching it

20
00:01:59,984 --> 00:02:04,554
Parts itself from the past,
and overflows

21
00:02:04,555 --> 00:02:09,292
I'll be by your side forever

22
00:02:09,293 --> 00:02:18,203
Do not be lured into
the somber shadows

23
00:02:30,648 --> 00:02:33,048
Please, everyone!
Hurry up and escape!

24
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:42,131
Fate!

25
00:02:44,562 --> 00:02:45,582
Fate!

26
00:02:51,802 --> 00:02:54,202
Fate! Fate!

27
00:02:59,343 --> 00:03:00,393
Fate!

28
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:05,346
Fly! Over here!

29
00:03:50,995 --> 00:03:54,975
Call My Name

30
00:04:08,145 --> 00:04:10,195
Looks like the earthquake is over.

31
00:04:11,415 --> 00:04:12,495
You're right!

32
00:04:15,853 --> 00:04:17,487
The Garden's destruction is complete.

33
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:20,089
Everything has been absorbed
into the imaginary number plane.

34
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:23,426
The dimensional tremor is ending.
There are no dimensional faults.

35
00:04:23,427 --> 00:04:24,494
Roger.

36
00:04:24,495 --> 00:04:26,129
Escaping at Speed Three.

37
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,740
Returning to our patrol course.

38
00:04:35,105 --> 00:04:36,906
Where's Fate?

39
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:38,942
She's in the brig with Aruf.

40
00:04:38,943 --> 00:04:41,945
Since she is a key witness
in this incident...

41
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:44,547
I'm sorry, but she will be
detained for a while.

42
00:04:44,548 --> 00:04:46,516
But that's... Ouch!

43
00:04:46,517 --> 00:04:47,917
Nanoha, stay still!

44
00:04:49,453 --> 00:04:53,022
This incident was a major case,
where one mistaken step

45
00:04:53,023 --> 00:04:56,492
might have caused the creation
of a dimensional faulit.

46
00:04:56,493 --> 00:04:58,795
The Time-Space Administration
Bureau has to be very careful

47
00:04:58,796 --> 00:05:01,464
about the treatment
of all involved parties.

48
00:05:01,465 --> 00:05:02,864
You understand that, right?

49
00:05:04,602 --> 00:05:05,568
Yeah.

50
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:07,503
Amy, do it over!

51
00:05:07,504 --> 00:05:08,374
Darn.

52
00:05:21,885 --> 00:05:24,375
And so, all sorts of things
came to an end.

53
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:28,625
From the day that I met
Yuuno until today...

54
00:05:28,626 --> 00:05:31,405
Now that everything's over, it seems
like it all happened in an instant.

55
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:35,164
We spent several days
aboard the Arthra,

56
00:05:35,165 --> 00:05:38,968
until the aftershocks of the
dimensional tremor subsided.

57
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:40,109
Rice bowl...

58
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:00,409
Since then...

59
00:06:02,793 --> 00:06:07,664
You demonstrated outstanding
service in the resolution of this case.

60
00:06:07,665 --> 00:06:09,565
Even if it's a bit informal,

61
00:06:09,566 --> 00:06:11,876
I'd like to award you for
your distinguished service.

62
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,938
Miss Nanoha Takamachi,
and Mr. Yuuno Scrya,

63
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:20,987
thank you!

64
00:06:37,594 --> 00:06:41,297
Chrono, what's going
to happen to Fate now?

65
00:06:41,298 --> 00:06:44,834
Though she had her reasons,
it's an undeniable fact

66
00:06:44,835 --> 00:06:47,794
that she was part of a conspiracy
in meddling with the dimensions.

67
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,007
It's a serious crime.

68
00:06:51,008 --> 00:06:53,376
Usually, you get locked up for
several centuries, if not more.

69
00:06:53,377 --> 00:06:54,677
That can't be!

70
00:06:54,678 --> 00:06:55,668
However!

71
00:06:57,147 --> 00:07:00,650
The situation is rather special,
and it's clear that

72
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:03,841
she wasn't party to the dimensional
crimes of her own will.

73
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:09,959
What we have left is to figure out

74
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,628
how to get the higher-ups
to understand those facts.

75
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:15,198
But I'm pretty confident
on that score,

76
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,100
so you don't have to worry at all.

77
00:07:17,101 --> 00:07:18,768
Chrono...

78
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:21,604
The Time-Space Administration
Bureau isn't a group

79
00:07:21,605 --> 00:07:25,408
of cold-hearted people who'd pin
a crime on a girl who knew nothing,

80
00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:28,429
and was just doing her best
to grant her mother's wish.

81
00:07:32,983 --> 00:07:36,285
Chrono... Can it be that you're
actually a really kind person?

82
00:07:36,286 --> 00:07:37,216
What...

83
00:07:40,924 --> 00:07:43,793
That was just stating
the obvious as an Enforcer!

84
00:07:43,794 --> 00:07:45,494
There were no personal
feelings involved!

85
00:07:46,697 --> 00:07:48,865
You don't have to be embarrassed.

86
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:50,666
I'm not embarrassed!

87
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:53,006
What?! Don't laugh!

88
00:07:54,705 --> 00:07:57,874
The dimensional tremor aftershocks
will be subsiding soon.

89
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:02,065
I think we can get back to your
world by tomorrow, Miss Nanoha.

90
00:08:02,913 --> 00:08:04,280
That's great!

91
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:09,152
However, the route to Midchilda
hasn't stabilized quite yet.

92
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:11,387
It looks like that will take some time.

93
00:08:11,388 --> 00:08:12,755
I see.

94
00:08:12,756 --> 00:08:15,024
A few months, maybe half a year...

95
00:08:15,025 --> 00:08:19,162
It looks like it will take that long
before we can cruise safely.

96
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:20,797
I see.

97
00:08:20,798 --> 00:08:23,132
Well, my clan is full of people

98
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:26,402
who wander all over the world
in search of archaeological ruins,

99
00:08:26,403 --> 00:08:29,939
so there really isn't a definite
necessity for me to hurry back.

100
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,010
But I can't really have you host me
on this ship for that long...

101
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,713
Then you can stay at my house,
like you have been!

102
00:08:37,714 --> 00:08:39,048
Is that all right, Nanoha?

103
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:40,016
Yeah!

104
00:08:40,017 --> 00:08:41,818
As long as you're fine with it, Yuuno.

105
00:08:41,818 --> 00:08:43,052
Then, well...

106
00:08:43,053 --> 00:08:46,055
Um, please take good care of me!

107
00:08:46,056 --> 00:08:46,956
Sure!

108
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,195
Geez, it's because you slept so much!

109
00:08:52,196 --> 00:08:55,164
But I was pulling so many all-nighters!

110
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:56,474
I'm still sleepy.

111
00:08:58,068 --> 00:09:01,704
The place called Alhazard
that she was aiming for...

112
00:09:01,705 --> 00:09:03,406
You know of it, right, Yuuno?

113
00:09:03,407 --> 00:09:05,842
Yes, I've heard of it before.

114
00:09:05,843 --> 00:09:09,479
They say it existed in previous
centuries, by the old calendar.

115
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,983
The land where many spells that
have been lost now still rest.

116
00:09:13,984 --> 00:09:15,017
But they also say

117
00:09:15,018 --> 00:09:18,821
that it fell into a dimensional fault
long ago, and fell to ruins.

118
00:09:18,822 --> 00:09:19,962
Hey there!

119
00:09:20,891 --> 00:09:24,327
They say that there is no wish
you can leave ungranted

120
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:28,464
using the powers of the
secret spells of Alhazard,

121
00:09:28,465 --> 00:09:30,900
with all sorts of magic
in its ultimate state.

122
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:35,261
Magic that can turn back time and
space, and even rewrite the past.

123
00:09:36,406 --> 00:09:40,042
Magic that can bring back to the living
a life that has been lost.

124
00:09:40,043 --> 00:09:42,011
Those were the things
she wanted, right?

125
00:09:42,012 --> 00:09:42,979
Yes...

126
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,749
But everyone who learns
magic knows for a fact

127
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:51,254
that turning back time and
raising the dead is impossible.

128
00:09:51,255 --> 00:09:54,156
That is why, seeking
both of those ideals,

129
00:09:54,157 --> 00:09:57,860
she could only rely on
such a fairy-tale legend.

130
00:09:57,861 --> 00:09:59,929
She had no choice but to rely on it.

131
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:04,930
But a mage of that level was
risking her life in that search.

132
00:10:05,135 --> 00:10:10,175
Perhaps she really had found
the path to Alhazard.

133
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:13,622
Though there's no way
for us to know now.

134
00:10:19,182 --> 00:10:22,985
I'm sorry, this mealtime story
has gotten quite long.

135
00:10:22,986 --> 00:10:24,820
Let's finish our meals
before they get cold.

136
00:10:24,821 --> 00:10:29,158
I'm sure this will be your last meal
aboard the Arthra, Nanoha.

137
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,092
Yeah...

138
00:10:30,093 --> 00:10:31,961
If parting ways makes you lonely,

139
00:10:31,962 --> 00:10:34,530
you should honestly just
come out and say it.

140
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:36,566
Chrono, you're so shy!

141
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:37,867
What?!

142
00:10:37,868 --> 00:10:41,871
Nanoha, you can always
come by and visit us, okay?

143
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:43,873
Yes! Thank you very much!

144
00:10:43,874 --> 00:10:47,310
Amy! The Arthra is not a playground!

145
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:49,478
Well now, it's all right.

146
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:53,015
When our mission is to patrol,
we're always full of idle time!

147
00:10:53,016 --> 00:10:54,976
Ca... Captain! You as well?!

148
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,460
And the morning where Yuuno
and I were going home...

149
00:11:01,992 --> 00:11:05,027
Well... Thank you so much for
everything you did this time.

150
00:11:05,028 --> 00:11:06,608
We appreciated your support.

151
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,639
I'll inform you of Fate's treatment
when it's been decided.

152
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,842
It's all right, I'll make sure that
nothing bad happens to her.

153
00:11:19,843 --> 00:11:22,011
Yeah... Thanks.

154
00:11:22,012 --> 00:11:25,581
Yuuno, when you want to
go back, please contact us.

155
00:11:25,582 --> 00:11:27,149
I'll let you use our gate.

156
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,140
Yes! Thank you very much!

157
00:11:30,354 --> 00:11:32,989
Then, I guess we're
about ready to go?

158
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,557
Yes!

159
00:11:34,558 --> 00:11:35,488
Then...

160
00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:40,594
I'll see you again, Chrono,
Miss Amy, Miss Lindy!

161
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:00,449
Should we go home now, Yuuno?

162
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,440
Sure.

163
00:12:09,926 --> 00:12:11,126
I'm home!

164
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:15,464
Nanoha!

165
00:12:15,465 --> 00:12:18,455
And what comes back
is my everyday life.

166
00:12:20,003 --> 00:12:21,470
It's the same as it had always been,

167
00:12:21,471 --> 00:12:22,371
but adding everything
that has happened,

168
00:12:22,372 --> 00:12:23,305
Mom, I'm hungry!
but adding everything
that has happened,

169
00:12:23,306 --> 00:12:24,573
Mom, I'm hungry!
everyday life is just a little bit
different from before.

170
00:12:24,574 --> 00:12:26,003
everyday life is just a little bit
different from before.

171
00:12:27,244 --> 00:12:28,174
Welcome home.

172
00:12:29,646 --> 00:12:31,080
Were you a good girl?

173
00:12:31,081 --> 00:12:31,931
Yeah!

174
00:12:38,221 --> 00:12:39,288
Nanoha!

175
00:12:39,289 --> 00:12:40,369
Nanoha!

176
00:12:44,194 --> 00:12:46,623
I'm home! I came back!

177
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:52,935
The time that you're
engrossed in something,

178
00:12:52,936 --> 00:12:56,416
after it's all over, seems like
a fleeting moment...

179
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:06,647
But in my heart,
it surely remains true.

180
00:13:07,984 --> 00:13:11,904
How we met... How desperate
I was... All sorts of things.

181
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,205
It's been a while since
I slept in my own bed!

182
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:32,074
Yuuno, you should rest up tonight too!

183
00:13:32,075 --> 00:13:33,275
Right.

184
00:13:33,276 --> 00:13:35,856
Thanks for all the hard work,
Raising Heart!

185
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:56,071
Thank you for all the
hard work, Nanoha.

186
00:14:04,508 --> 00:14:07,548
The one thing that's
still on my mind...

187
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:12,618
About that girl with the gentle eyes,
that must surely be very kind.

188
00:14:28,064 --> 00:14:29,174
Several days later...

189
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:54,759
Incoming Call: Time-Space
Administration Bureau

190
00:14:56,193 --> 00:14:57,803
Yes, this is Nanoha!

191
00:15:01,398 --> 00:15:03,499
Really?!

192
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,101
Yeabh, it's been officially decided on
a few moments ago.

193
00:15:06,102 --> 00:15:08,838
Fate will be transferred
over to headquarters,

194
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:11,709
and there she will face
questioning and a trial.

195
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:16,745
Fate will probably - no, almost
definitely - be innocent.

196
00:15:16,746 --> 00:15:17,813
Everything will be all right.

197
00:15:17,814 --> 00:15:21,417
Because Chrono was working
overtime to gather all the evidence.

198
00:15:21,418 --> 00:15:25,154
Amy! You don't have to mention
unnecessary information like that!

199
00:15:25,155 --> 00:15:26,855
Thank you, Chrono!

200
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:32,795
The questioning, trial, and everything
else will take quite a bit of time.

201
00:15:32,796 --> 00:15:34,396
But, before that...

202
00:15:34,397 --> 00:15:35,431
Yeah...

203
00:15:35,432 --> 00:15:36,732
Yeah!

204
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:38,500
I'll be right there!

205
00:15:38,501 --> 00:15:39,430
Yeah!

206
00:15:40,637 --> 00:15:41,946
What's up, Nanoha?

207
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:47,142
Fate is going to be transferred
to headquarters for a while.

208
00:15:47,143 --> 00:15:50,913
But before that, I can see her
for just a little bit!

209
00:15:50,914 --> 00:15:52,147
I see.

210
00:15:52,148 --> 00:15:54,518
She's saying that
she wants to see me!

211
00:16:21,544 --> 00:16:23,384
Fate!

212
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:37,626
There isn't much time, but
sit down and have a talk for a while.

213
00:16:37,627 --> 00:16:39,117
We'll be over there.

214
00:16:40,196 --> 00:16:41,126
Thanks!

215
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:44,009
Thank you.

216
00:17:12,595 --> 00:17:15,731
There were so many things
I wanted to talk to you about.

217
00:17:15,732 --> 00:17:17,266
But it's funny.

218
00:17:17,267 --> 00:17:20,803
When I saw your face, Fate,
I forgot all of them.

219
00:17:20,804 --> 00:17:24,440
L.. Let's see...

220
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:26,631
I can't put it into words well, either.

221
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:30,071
But I was really happy.

222
00:17:31,781 --> 00:17:33,591
That you looked at me
so straight-forwardly.

223
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:37,897
Yeah! I thought that it would be
great if we could be friends!

224
00:17:39,322 --> 00:17:42,782
But today, you have to head out
right after this, right?

225
00:17:45,028 --> 00:17:48,128
That's true. It will be
a pretty long trip.

226
00:17:49,532 --> 00:17:51,052
But I can see you again, right?

227
00:17:56,673 --> 00:18:00,803
It's a bit sad, but I can finally
begin to be my own self.

228
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:05,889
I had you come here so that
I could give you an answer.

229
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,590
The words that you told me...
That you wanted to be my friend.

230
00:18:14,591 --> 00:18:15,991
Yeah, yeah!

231
00:18:15,992 --> 00:18:18,922
If it's possible for me...
if you're okay with me...

232
00:18:19,996 --> 00:18:22,926
But I don't know what
I should be doing.

233
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:25,901
So I want you to tell me.

234
00:18:25,902 --> 00:18:27,982
How do you become a friend?

235
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,320
That's easy.

236
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:42,179
It's really easy to become friends.

237
00:18:45,522 --> 00:18:47,072
Call my name.

238
00:18:48,658 --> 00:18:50,859
In the beginning,
that's all you have to do.

239
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,962
Not "you" or "hey, you"
or anything like that.

240
00:18:53,963 --> 00:18:55,764
Look directly at the person's eyes,

241
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:57,985
and clearly call them by their name.

242
00:18:59,702 --> 00:19:02,337
I'm Nanoha Takamachi!

243
00:19:02,338 --> 00:19:03,298
Call me Nanoha!

244
00:19:04,474 --> 00:19:05,774
Nanoha...

245
00:19:05,775 --> 00:19:07,235
Yeah! That's it!

246
00:19:08,611 --> 00:19:10,446
Nanoha...

247
00:19:10,447 --> 00:19:11,496
Yeah...

248
00:19:12,749 --> 00:19:13,769
Nanoha!

249
00:19:14,884 --> 00:19:15,904
Yeah!

250
00:19:21,324 --> 00:19:23,104
Thank you, Nanoha.

251
00:19:24,327 --> 00:19:25,497
Yeah...

252
00:19:26,696 --> 00:19:27,836
Nanoha...

253
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:33,936
Yeah!

254
00:19:35,738 --> 00:19:38,488
Your hands are so warm, Nanoha.

255
00:19:45,548 --> 00:19:47,218
There's something that I figured out.

256
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:52,171
When a friend is crying,
you're sad in the same way.

257
00:19:53,556 --> 00:19:54,926
Fate!

258
00:19:56,392 --> 00:19:58,527
Thank you, Nanoha.

259
00:19:58,528 --> 00:20:02,131
We'll part for now, but I'm sure
we'll see each other again.

260
00:20:02,132 --> 00:20:06,435
When that happens, can I
call you by your name again?

261
00:20:06,436 --> 00:20:08,305
Yeah, yeah!

262
00:20:09,472 --> 00:20:12,022
When I want to see you,
I'm sure to be calling your name.

263
00:20:14,777 --> 00:20:17,207
So Nanoha, I want you
to call for me too.

264
00:20:18,982 --> 00:20:21,416
If something is
troubling you, Nanoha...

265
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:24,577
I'm sure that this time,
I will save you, Nanoha.

266
00:20:38,668 --> 00:20:41,003
Your girl over there...

267
00:20:41,004 --> 00:20:42,538
Nanoha...

268
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:44,873
She sure is a good girl.

269
00:20:44,874 --> 00:20:47,774
Fate is smiling so much right now.

270
00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:01,789
It's time. Are you about done?

271
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:05,664
Fate!

272
00:21:13,703 --> 00:21:17,940
This is all I have that I can use
as a token of our memories.

273
00:21:17,941 --> 00:21:19,491
Then, I should too.

274
00:21:30,453 --> 00:21:32,233
Thank you, Nanoha.

275
00:21:33,456 --> 00:21:34,626
Fate...

276
00:21:36,092 --> 00:21:37,926
I'm sure once again...

277
00:21:37,927 --> 00:21:39,766
Yeah! I'm sure once again...

278
00:21:46,102 --> 00:21:47,502
Thank you!

279
00:21:47,503 --> 00:21:48,903
Miss Aruf, you stay well too!

280
00:21:49,739 --> 00:21:52,708
Thanks for everything,
Nanoha, Yuuno.

281
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:54,610
Well then, I'm on my way too.

282
00:21:54,611 --> 00:21:56,144
See you later, Chrono!

283
00:21:56,145 --> 00:21:57,105
Yeah.

284
00:22:13,196 --> 00:22:15,186
Bye-bye, see you later...

285
00:22:16,866 --> 00:22:18,266
Chrono...

286
00:22:20,603 --> 00:22:21,563
Miss Aruf...

287
00:22:24,173 --> 00:22:25,403
Fate!

288
00:23:07,884 --> 00:23:09,024
Nanoha?

289
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:12,791
Yeah!

290
00:23:14,724 --> 00:23:15,757
Make a little wish

291
00:23:15,758 --> 00:23:20,588
Even though at times
I'll trip or get lost

292
00:23:21,698 --> 00:23:31,548
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic

293
00:23:36,946 --> 00:23:41,946
Ah, don't look down as
you walk, it's all right

294
00:23:43,686 --> 00:23:47,389
The courage that you handed to me
that day is still in my hands

295
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,590
Nanoha!

296
00:23:48,591 --> 00:23:49,958
The courage that you handed to me
that day is still in my hands

297
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:51,259
Coming!

298
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:56,260
Each time I blink,
more kindness is born

299
00:23:58,634 --> 00:24:03,634
See, this love is something I want
to nurture always, forever

300
00:24:06,876 --> 00:24:08,710
Make a little wish

301
00:24:08,711 --> 00:24:13,711
Wearing the lemon-colored
drops from the moon

302
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:19,650
I want to keep glimmering with
a twinkle and keep on as your energy

303
00:24:21,657 --> 00:24:23,091
Make a little wish

304
00:24:23,092 --> 00:24:28,092
On rainy days and dawns
when I couldn't fall asleep

305
00:24:28,998 --> 00:24:33,998
Because you were here with me,
I was able to smile my best

306
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:39,288
Just like this

307
00:24:44,013 --> 00:24:49,013
Whenever we're apart, I still have
something I can believe in

308
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:56,220
See, our hearts are always,
surely together as one

309
00:24:59,762 --> 00:25:01,296
Make a little wish

310
00:25:01,297 --> 00:25:06,297
Collecting the lemon-colored
drops from the moon

311
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:12,170
Let's turn them into warm tears,
and make them spices for smiles

312
00:25:14,243 --> 00:25:15,844
Make a little wish

313
00:25:15,845 --> 00:25:20,845
Even though at times
I'll trip or get lost

314
00:25:21,717 --> 00:25:31,567
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic
