1
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:09,876
It was a small incident that happened
to me, Nanoha Takamachi,

2
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:12,897
a girl who was supposed to be
an ordinary third-grader.

3
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:18,308
I accepted the heart of courage,
and I gained magical powers.

4
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:21,887
As my beliefs became stronger,

5
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:23,759
the unyielding wishes
became stronger as well.

6
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,016
But I don't want to give up
on communicating,

7
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:32,724
because I don't want to end
without understanding anything.

8
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:39,603
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha
is about to begin.

9
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:01,327
Cradling my knees in
a corner of my room

10
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:04,696
I always shivered from uncertainty

11
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:09,698
I was scared of learning the truth,
so I closed the door

12
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:17,072
I found my own place within a kind lie
and I fled inside my dreams

13
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:24,279
I dye a sea of loneliness that
nobody knows of into a deep blue

14
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:32,654
An intense feeling to
hide the loneliness

15
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:38,627
Is continually injuring your heart

16
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:44,536
The secret hidden deep
within the eyes

17
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:49,107
To the truth behind the smile
that draws me in

18
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:54,109
I will deliver a love so soft

19
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:59,051
Right now, a warmth that might
break upon touching it

20
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:03,655
Parts itself from the past,
and overflows

21
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:08,193
I'll be by your side forever

22
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:17,255
Do not be lured into
the somber shadows

23
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,259
I've been thinking all this time.

24
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,702
About the girl who I'm sure
is close to me in age,

25
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,633
and has deep, pretty eyes.

26
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:05,085
I'm sure that we'll have another
fight if we see each other again.

27
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:10,223
But...

28
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:16,064
Episode Ã©:
Feelings That Can't Be Understood?

29
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:19,804
That's enough!

30
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:27,206
Ever since that day, you always
space out when we're talking!

31
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,075
I'm sorry, Arisa.

32
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:30,109
Don't apologize!

33
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,879
If talking to us is that boring,

34
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,414
you can just sit by yourself and
space out as much as you want!

35
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,584
Let's go, Suzuka!

36
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,234
Arisa...

37
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:41,174
Nanoha...

38
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,756
It's all right, Suzuka.

39
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:46,192
That was all my fault, anyway.

40
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:48,528
I don't think that's the case.

41
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:50,763
I think Arisa said more
than she should have too.

42
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,344
I'll go talk to her for a bit.

43
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:54,287
I'm sorry...

44
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,300
I made her mad.

45
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,012
I'm sorry, Arisa.

46
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,796
Arisa! Arisa!

47
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,170
Arisa...

48
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,186
What is it?

49
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:15,922
I kind of understand
why you're so angry,

50
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,913
but you shouldn't have
gotten that mad.

51
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,859
I mean, it irritates me!

52
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,929
It's plain obvious that she's
worried about something.

53
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,264
It's plain obvious that she's in trouble!

54
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,724
But no matter what we ask her,
she won't tell us anything!

55
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,406
She's lying, saying she's not
confused or worried!

56
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,474
No matter how good friends we are,

57
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,443
there are things that we
can't tell each other.

58
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,179
If it's something that Nanoha
wants to keep a secret,

59
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,960
I think all we can do is
wait for her to tell us.

60
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,285
I'm telling you, that's
what irritates me!

61
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,306
I want to be of help to her,
even if only by a little bit!

62
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,857
I don't care what it's about.

63
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,727
I may not be able to do anything.

64
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:57,248
But at least we can
think it through with her!

65
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,537
Arisa, you really do care
about Nanoha a lot.

66
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,528
Of course I do!

67
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:20,373
Because she was here, I was
finally able to stop being all alone.

68
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:29,483
You're right. The same goes for me.

69
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:40,329
Because Nanoha was here,
we were able to become friends.

70
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:51,744
See you, Nanoha.

71
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:56,222
I'm sorry, we both have
lessons again today.

72
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,324
They last until late at night, right?

73
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:00,224
Take care, and do your best!

74
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,133
Arisa?!

75
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:07,102
It'll be all right, okay, Nanoha?

76
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,941
Yeah... Thanks, Suzuka...

77
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:25,095
You know, it's been a while since
I last walked home by myself.

78
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,558
I think I'll take a detour
on the way home.

79
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,989
Because I don't want anyone
to see how I look right now...

80
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,606
Do you remember when we first met?

81
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,576
I used to be much more timid,

82
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,446
and I couldn't say anything
that was on my mind,

83
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:56,547
and no matter what anyone said,
I couldn't argue back.

84
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,821
I hate to say it, but I think
I was a rotten kid.

85
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:04,042
Arrogant, selfish, boastful...

86
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:08,094
That's why I made fun
of my classmates.

87
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,115
Because I really had a weak will.

88
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:12,348
That's...

89
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:19,338
And because I had a weak will,
I couldn't say what I needed to say.

90
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:22,329
"That is something very dear
to me, so give it back."

91
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,779
Though people told me
to stop it, I didn't listen.

92
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,448
I felt that I would somehow lose,

93
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,699
if I honestly listened to what
someone else had to say.

94
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,609
What was it that Nanoha
said back then?

95
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:48,901
"Did that hurt?"

96
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:52,071
"But the heart of someone who got
something dear to her taken away"

97
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:53,772
"hurts much, much more than that."

98
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:56,839
That's right...

99
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:02,185
I think I ended up in a huge fight
with Arisa after that.

100
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,590
And the one that stopped us was...

101
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,977
..the very quiet girl that caused it all.

102
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:12,655
Stop it!

103
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:18,602
Because I was really
desperate right then...

104
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:24,503
And since then, we slowly started
to talk to each other, right?

105
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,404
Right. The three of us...

106
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,711
And so, Suzuka, bringing up
that old story,

107
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,047
what the heck do you want me to do?

108
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:36,597
As if you didn't know.

109
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:48,487
I know that she just doesn't want us
to worry about whatever it is.

110
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:53,299
And that we probably can't be
of any help to her, either.

111
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,151
If all we can do is to wait for her...

112
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,874
Then I'll just stay upset
while waiting for her!

113
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,009
At the loneliness from not
sharing our feelings,

114
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,080
and at myself for not being able
to help a friend!

115
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,582
You're so stubborn.

116
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,752
Hmph!

117
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,924
I see. So you guys got in a fight.

118
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:19,992
It's not like that.

119
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:24,563
Arisa just scolded me because
I kept blanking out.

120
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,131
You're close friends, right?

121
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:29,122
Yeah, ever since we
first entered school.

122
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,472
Here!

123
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,211
This is your share, Yuuno.

124
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,780
Since there's no cram school today,

125
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:45,718
we can take our time to search
for Jewel Seeds until dinnertime!

126
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,553
Let's do our best together!

127
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:49,223
Yeah... Let's do our best.

128
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:10,055
The food in this world...
Well, it's not that bad!

129
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,839
Now, where is my little princess?

130
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,513
Whoops, I forgot something!

131
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,627
Oh, you haven't eaten
your meal again!

132
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,749
That's not good! You have to eat.

133
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,358
I ate, just a little. I'm fine.

134
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,580
Let's get going soon.

135
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:51,216
I've determined the approximate
location of the next Jewel Seed.

136
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,737
I don't want to keep Mother waiting.

137
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:58,691
Well, Fate, you are my master,

138
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,826
and I am your familiar,

139
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,197
so if you're saying
we need to go, we'll go.

140
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,997
We can leave after you're done eating.

141
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,536
That's not what I mean!

142
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,538
I'm worried about you, Fate!

143
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:15,541
Wide-area search magic takes
a whole lot of stamina,

144
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:18,544
but you've barely been
eating or sleeping!

145
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:21,213
And those wounds aren't that
simple either, you know?

146
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:23,644
It's all right. I'm tough.

147
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,414
Fate...

148
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:40,833
Now, let's go.

149
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,901
Mother is waiting for us.

150
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,494
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha!

151
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:11,318
Hey, Kyouya, about Nanoha...

152
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:15,668
Has she been worried
about something lately?

153
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:17,636
Even I think that when I look at her.

154
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:19,938
It's really worrying Suzuka.

155
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,306
Maybe...

156
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:25,010
She's going out more often in the
afternoons and evenings lately.

157
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,812
I don't want to meddle,

158
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:29,682
but should I try talking to her?

159
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:33,752
That would be great, but I don't
think she'll tell you anything.

160
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,354
You don't think I'm good enough?

161
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,690
No, no, that's not what I mean.

162
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:40,159
It's not that she won't tell
you personally, Shinobu.

163
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,361
I don't think she'd tell anyone.

164
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:46,832
She's always been like that when
something's bothering her,

165
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,767
or when she's trying to
decide on something.

166
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,998
Really?

167
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,671
Well, I don't think there's much
you need to worry about.

168
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:03,494
I'm sure she will reach
the answer on her own.

169
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,714
I see.

170
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,035
I think we're out of time.

171
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:25,070
We need to get home soon.

172
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,338
It's okay.

173
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,479
I'll stay here and search a bit more.

174
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,744
Yuuno, will you be
all right by yourself?

175
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:34,346
I'll be fine, so save me
some dinner, okay?

176
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:35,307
Okay.

177
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:44,957
Maybe Arisa and Suzuka
are done with their lessons

178
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,568
and are on their way home by now?

179
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,370
There is no new mail.

180
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,788
I think it's somewhere around here,

181
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:17,990
but I can only figure out
the approximate location.

182
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:22,211
Yeah. When things are this crowded,
it's a chore to find them.

183
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,298
It's a bit rough,

184
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,433
but I'm going to shower the area
with magical power,

185
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,235
and force it to execute.

186
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,470
Hey, hold on!

187
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,071
I'll do that!

188
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,206
Are you all right?

189
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,607
It's pretty tiring, you know.

190
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:39,146
Just whose familiar
do you think I am?

191
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,914
Then, please.

192
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:43,025
Here goes!

193
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,047
Forcing an execution in
the middle of the city?!

194
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:16,658
A barrier... Can I make it in time?!

195
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,295
Raising Heart, please!

196
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,296
Found it!

197
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:40,017
But they seem to be nearby too!

198
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,286
Let's get it over with
quickly. Bardiche!

199
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:49,341
Sealing form, set up.

200
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:02,888
Nanoha! Can you see the
executed Jewel Seed?

201
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,923
Yeah. It's right here!

202
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:06,892
Those guys are close by.

203
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:08,927
Seal it before they do!

204
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:09,778
Got it!

205
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:31,049
Lyrical, magical!

206
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,010
Jewel Seed Serial XIX...

207
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,410
Seal!

208
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:49,261
Device Mode.

209
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:15,117
Stop it!

210
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:25,547
Neither Arisa nor Suzuka were
friends with me when we first met.

211
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,074
Because we couldn't
talk to each other,

212
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:30,805
because we couldn't
understand each other.

213
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,612
The reason why I made Arisa mad

214
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,747
was because I couldn't
tell her how I really felt,

215
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:37,968
what I was really thinking.

216
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,490
All right! Nanoha, hurry up
and capture it!

217
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:46,921
I won't let you!

218
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,040
Because we both have an objective,

219
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:05,077
we probably can't help
clashing against each other.

220
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:06,748
But I still want to know!

221
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:13,552
I couldn't introduce myself
the other day.

222
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:15,120
I'm Nanoha.

223
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:16,788
Nanoha Takamachi.

224
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:19,399
A third grader at Seisho University
Magnet Elementary.

225
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,800
Scythe Form.

226
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,556
Why do you have such sad eyes?

227
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:39,911
Flier Fin.

228
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:50,589
Sending mail to Nanoha?

229
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,990
Yeah. Saying my lesson is over.

230
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,799
Now, let's go home.

231
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,850
Okay... Hold on a second!

232
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:10,256
I just got done with my lesson.
I'm going to go home and have dinner how.
Arisa isn't all too upset, so everything is fine.
Nanoha, I hope your worries are solved...

233
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:16,148
..your worries are solved soon.

234
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:20,152
Please do your best. I'll always be
cheering you on.

235
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:21,720
From Suzuka.

236
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,591
Sending mail

237
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:32,967
Flash Move.

238
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:37,641
Divine Shooter.

239
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:39,921
Defenser.

240
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:49,341
Fate!

241
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:56,188
You said that just talking it out,

242
00:20:56,189 --> 00:20:58,256
mere words, won't get
the point across.

243
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,126
But I'm sure there are things out
there that don't make it across

244
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,466
unless you talk, unless you
put them into words!

245
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,132
Clashing with each other,
competing with each other,

246
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,601
maybe that can't be avoided...

247
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:13,732
But I don't want to keep fighting
without knowing anything at all!

248
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:21,713
I'm collecting Jewel Seeds because
Yuuno is looking for them.

249
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:24,482
Yuuno was the one that
found the Jewel Seeds,

250
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:27,953
and Yuuno is the one that needs
to collect them all back together.

251
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:30,355
I'm helping him out.

252
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:34,826
But even though it was coincidence
that I started helping him,

253
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:37,727
I'm now collecting the
Jewel Seeds of my own will.

254
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:41,466
Because I don't want to see
the city where I live in danger,

255
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,397
or all the people around me!

256
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:47,378
That's my reason!

257
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,943
L.

258
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:53,904
Fate, you don't have to answer that!

259
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:58,250
You don't have to tell
anything to a little brat

260
00:21:58,251 --> 00:22:02,031
who's lived her life
surrounded by nice people!

261
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:07,055
Our primary objective is to
capture all the Jewel Seeds!

262
00:22:12,265 --> 00:22:12,998
Nanoha!

263
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,079
I'm okay!

264
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:07,685
Suzuka, what's wrong?

265
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,322
No, it's nothing.

266
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:12,933
There is no new mail.

267
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:18,404
Man, I'm starving. Let's hurry home!

268
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:20,318
Okay!

269
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,404
Make a little wish

270
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:31,065
Even though at times
I'll trip or get lost

271
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:42,045
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic

272
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:52,393
Ah, going over the sea of cellophane
and over the forests

273
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:57,902
Passing through the silver wind

274
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:01,940
I was looking for something
neither of us had

275
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:06,941
Ah, I was just crying inside
a diorama of a city

276
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:13,748
Until I met that warm hand that
reached out to me that day

277
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:21,455
Among the swaying days,
I felt a strong gaze

278
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:28,462
Hey, I finally, finally
found the secret key

279
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:33,505
Make a little wish

280
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:38,136
Collecting the lemon-colored
drops from the moon

281
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:44,445
I want to keep a light shining
on the road that you travel down

282
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,052
Make a little wish

283
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:52,853
I wonder if there is something
I can do even though I'm so little

284
00:24:53,893 --> 00:25:04,183
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic

285
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:18,049
For an explosion like that to occur...
That's just got to be bad!

286
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:21,453
But Mother is waiting.

287
00:25:21,454 --> 00:25:23,421
What is the truth behind
the Jewel Seeds?

288
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:25,702
And a new mage appears?!

289
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:27,392

Lyrical, magical, in hopes
that I won't lose!
