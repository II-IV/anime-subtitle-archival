1
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:05,939
It was a small incident that happened
to me, Nanoha Takamachi,

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,750
a girl who was supposed to be
an ordinary third-grader.

3
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:13,367
I accepted the heart of courage,
and I gained magical powers.

4
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:17,916
The feelings that collided before
differences were resolved

5
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:19,848
disappeared inside the bright light.

6
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:25,525
Is the path that I chose to fumble for
really the correct path?

7
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,576
I'm sure there will be times
when I can't decide.

8
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:31,130
But I'm sure that the footsteps
where I ran without stopping

9
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:34,031
will lead toward what
is to come for me.

10
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:38,458
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha
is about to begin.

11
00:00:56,557 --> 00:01:00,493
Cradling my knees in
a corner of my room

12
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:04,030
I always shivered from uncertainty

13
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:09,031
I was scared of learning the truth,
so I closed the door

14
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:16,071
I found my own place within a kind lie
and I fled inside my dreams

15
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:23,412
I dye a sea of loneliness that
nobody knows of into a deep blue

16
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:31,987
An intense feeling to
hide the loneliness

17
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,760
Is continually injuring your heart

18
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:43,702
The secret hidden deep
within the eyes

19
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:48,241
To the truth behind the smile
that draws me in

20
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:53,242
I will deliver a love so soft

21
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,217
Right now, a warmth that might
break upon touching it

22
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:02,789
Parts itself from the past,
and overflows

23
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,326
I'll be by your side forever

24
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:16,387
Do not be lured into
the somber shadows

25
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:27,974
April 26, 8:27PM
Uminari City, outskirts, within the barriers

26
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:42,128
Fate!

27
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,089
Nanoha!

28
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:53,275
Episode 7:
Is This a Third Magician?

29
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,802
It's all right. You can
return, Bardiche.

30
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:23,913
Yes, sir.

31
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,116
Fate?!

32
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:48,051
Fate!

33
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:49,929
No! That's dangerous!

34
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:57,073
Stop...

35
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,940
Stop... stop...

36
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:06,514
Stop... stop...

37
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:09,482
Stop!

38
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:23,646
Fate!

39
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:52,759
Same day, 9:15pm Uminari City,
residential area, Takamachi residence

40
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,624
Nanoha

41
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,200
Raising Heart is a device

42
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:04,011
that can withstand quite a bit
of released power.

43
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,491
To think that one attack would
damage it this much...

44
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:11,823
Was it the clash between that girl's
and Nanoha's magical power?

45
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,866
No... Besides, that
doesn't explain it all.

46
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,174
So it was, after all, the Jewel Seed's...

47
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:29,228
Yuuno, is Raising Heart all right?

48
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:31,839
Yeabh... It sustained
extensive damage,

49
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,667
but I'm sure it will be all right.

50
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,237
It's running the auto-repair
function at full speed right now,

51
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:40,018
so I think it will be
back up by tomorrow.

52
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,344
And are you all right, Nanoha?

53
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,165
Yeah,

54
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,715
because Raising Heart protected me.

55
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,466
I'm so sorry, Raising Heart.

56
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:03,032
Same day, same time
Tohmi City, residential area

57
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,981
I'm sorry, Fate.

58
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,322
Hang in there a little longer.

59
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:25,311
I'm fine.

60
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,200
Thanks, Aruf.

61
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:32,226
I have to go back tomorrow
to report to Mother,

62
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,426
so I need to heal this quickly.

63
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:39,301
I'm sure I'll make her worry
if I returned home all torn up.

64
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:44,627
Would she actually be worried?

65
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,929
Mother is just a little awkward.

66
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:55,414
I know that for certain.

67
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,895
If it's just a report,
I can just go and do it.

68
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:04,307
Mother doesn't really listen to
what you have to say, Aruf.

69
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,020
But you're such a kind, good girl, Aruf.

70
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,070
Well... I'm sure you'll be
fine tomorrow!

71
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,001
In such a short time,
you found Lost Logia...

72
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:23,676
Four of those Jewel Seeds!

73
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:24,810
She might not praise you,

74
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,210
but I'm sure that she
won't scold you for it!

75
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:29,312
Yeah...

76
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:32,498
You're right.

77
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:41,018
April 27 6:15AM
Takamachi residence

78
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,414
Hm? Nanoha?

79
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:03,082
Oh, big sister.

80
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,885
What's wrong? You're up
really early today.

81
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:09,488
Well, I just kinda woke up, so...

82
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,890
I see.

83
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,426
Hey, where's big brother?

84
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:14,217
Yeah...

85
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:18,371
He's gone running with Dad this
morning, a little further than usual.

86
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:22,395
Um...

87
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,450
Your practice...

88
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,019
If I'm not bothering you,
can I watch?

89
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:32,106
I don't think it's very interesting.

90
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:34,907
But sure, I don't mind.

91
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,900
Thanks.

92
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:58,566
Nanoha?

93
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:00,305
Yuuno?

94
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,247
What's wrong?
It's so early in the day.

95
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,202
I just kinda woke up, so...

96
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,198
Anyway, Yuuno,

97
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,232
I've been thinking.

98
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:16,726
L.

99
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:19,658
That girl...

100
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,094
Fate is still on my mind.

101
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,355
She's on your mind?

102
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,707
She's really strong,

103
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,853
and she seems really cold-hearted,

104
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,613
but she has very pretty, gentle eyes.

105
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:39,564
And yet...

106
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:43,514
Somehow, they're very... melancholy.

107
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,717
I'm sure she has a reason behind it.

108
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,640
A reason why she's
collecting the Jewel Seeds.

109
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,565
That's why I...

110
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:01,236
I want to have a good talk with her.

111
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:05,089
So... To do that...

112
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:19,021
Same day, 8:17AM Tohmi City,
residential area, condominium rooftop

113
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,988
This should be enough for souvenirs.

114
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,349
An assortment of sweets?

115
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:31,048
Would she be happy with
something like this?

116
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,745
I don't know, but it's
the feeling that counts.

117
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:39,772
Dimensional teleport.

118
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:43,976
Dimensional coordinates 876C4419.

119
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:52,327
3312D699... 3583A1460... 779F3125.

120
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,502
Open, doors of luring.

121
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:02,282
To the Garden of Time, to the
master of the Testarossas!

122
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:19,603
Same day, same time
Within dimensional space

123
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,957
Time-Space Administration Bureau
Dimensional space flight flagship Arthra

124
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:39,865
How is everyone doing?
Is this journey going well?

125
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:44,036
We're currently cruising
at triple ship speed.

126
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,171
We will be arriving at the
destination dimension

127
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,974
in approximately 160 bexas.

128
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,276
Since the last small
dimensional tremor,

129
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,646
there hasn't been much
noticeable action,

130
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:57,487
but the danger of two seekers
clashing once again is very high.

131
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:01,620
I see.

132
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,761
Excuse me, Captain Lindy.

133
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,432
Thank you, Amy.

134
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:11,063
Admiral, Time-Space Administration Bureau
Captain of the Arthra, Lindy Harlaown

135
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:11,964
You're right.

136
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:15,853
Even if it's small, the creation
of a dimensional tremor...

137
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,072
..is rather troublesome.

138
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,413
If it gets dangerous, you must
hurry over to the site.

139
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:25,487
Right, Chrono?

140
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:26,145
Time-Space Administration Bureau
Enforcer, Chrono Harlaown

141
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:28,814
Time-Space Administration Bureau
Enforcer, Chrono Harlaown
It's all right. I understand, Captain.

142
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:29,045
It's all right. I understand, Captain.

143
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,300
That is the reason I'm here.

144
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:53,132
Somewhere in high-dimensional space
Garden of Time

145
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,929
Only four?

146
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:12,194
This is all but horrible.

147
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:16,545
Yes...

148
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,419
I'm sorry... Mother.

149
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,520
Look here.

150
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:28,675
Fate, you are my daughter.

151
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:33,756
The sole daughter of the
great mage Precia Testarossa.

152
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:38,345
Nothing should be impossible for you.

153
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,589
No matter what.

154
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,689
That's right, you must
accomplish everything,

155
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,620
no matter what the cost.

156
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,427
Yes.

157
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,508
You made me wait all this time,

158
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:53,761
and you come up with so few...

159
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,434
There's no way I could have
welcomed you with a smile.

160
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:02,153
You understand, right, Fate?

161
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:05,410
Yes... I understand.

162
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:06,580
That is why...

163
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,079
That is why I want you to remember,

164
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:15,408
so that you never disappoint
your mother again.

165
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,016
What the hell?

166
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,578
What in the hell is this?!

167
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:33,839
It's too horrible!

168
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,980
That woman...

169
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:44,383
That woman's... Fate's
mother's abnormalities,

170
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:48,284
and her cruelty to Fate,
aren't anything new.

171
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,712
But this time, it's gone too far!

172
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,820
What the hell are they?!

173
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,460
Those Lost Logia... those Jewel
Seeds... are they that important?!

174
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,134
The Lost Logia

175
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,776
are absolutely necessary
in order to fulfill my dreams.

176
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,995
Yes, Mother.

177
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,817
Especially those Jewel Seeds,

178
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:21,428
which have a much higher
purity than anything else.

179
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,890
Because you are a kind child,

180
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:27,820
you may find yourself
hesitating at times.

181
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:32,364
But if anything is getting
in the way, crush it.

182
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:34,005
No matter what the cost!

183
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:38,545
Because you have
the power to do so...

184
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:46,558
You'll go for me, right?

185
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:50,949
My daughter...

186
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,380
My dear Fate.

187
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:56,919
Yes...

188
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,680
I'm on my way, Mother.

189
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:02,357
I'll take a nap for a while.

190
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:05,530
Next time, please make sure

191
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,751
to appease your mother.

192
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:09,722
Yes...

193
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,980
Fate!

194
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,659
Fate, I'm sorry...

195
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,698
Are you all right?

196
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,630
Why are you apologizing, Aruf?

197
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,138
I'm fine. It's nothing.

198
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,429
Because!

199
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:51,643
I didn't think it would end up like this.

200
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:54,346
You brought back what
she told you to bring back,

201
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,097
so I didn't think she'd do
something that cruel to you.

202
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:00,633
If I had known, I definitely
would have stopped you.

203
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,420
It's not cruel.

204
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:08,357
Mother was thinking
about my well-being.

205
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:10,462
The hell she was!

206
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:13,623
That... It's nothing more than
taking her anger out on you!

207
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,084
You're wrong,

208
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,812
because we're family.

209
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:25,465
I'm sure the Jewel Seeds are
very important to Mother.

210
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:30,586
Because she's been unfortunate
and sad all this time...

211
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:36,054
I want to find some way
to make her happy.

212
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,715
But... But still...

213
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:43,094
Aruf, please.

214
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,710
I'm sure it will be all right.

215
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,639
If I come home with the
Jewel Seeds in hand,

216
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,773
I'm sure Mother will smile at me.

217
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:56,626
She'll return to the kind Mother
that she used to be.

218
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,857
And I'm sure she will be
nice to you too, Aruf.

219
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:04,813
So let's go.

220
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:07,279
This time...

221
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,643
We can't fail.

222
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:21,207
April 27, 1:32PM  Seisho University Magnet
Elementary School, 3rd grade, classroom 1

223
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:32,574
April 27, 4:10PM
Uminari City, outskirts

224
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,018
How is it, Bardiche?

225
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,419
Recovery complete.

226
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:46,058
I see. You did your best. Good job.

227
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,928
You can feel it... Even I can sense it.

228
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,320
There is one that will
execute soon, very close by.

229
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:58,021
April 27, 5:05PM
Uminari city, residential district

230
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:08,299
Raising Heart, you're all fixed.

231
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,282
Thank goodness.

232
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:11,750
Condition green.

233
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:14,753
Will you do your best with me again?

234
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,504
All right, my master.

235
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,542
Thanks.

236
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:26,014
April 27, 6:24PM
Uminari city, Uminari Seaside Park

237
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:52,457
Time-sealing Barrier...

238
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,308
Unfold!

239
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,400
It's conceited enough
to put up a barrier?

240
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:20,252
It's the strongest one so far.

241
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:21,453
Besides...

242
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,181
That girl is here too.

243
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,326
Yuuno! Run!

244
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:32,956
Flier Fin.

245
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:37,736
Please fly, Raising Heart! Even higher!

246
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:38,997
All right.

247
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:44,990
Arc Saber!

248
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,779
Let's go, Bardiche.

249
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,010
Arc Saber.

250
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:53,205
Shooting Mode.

251
00:20:58,191 --> 00:20:59,941
Let's go, Raising Heart!

252
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,742
Shoot through it!

253
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:13,672
Divine...

254
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:14,963
Buster.

255
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,420
Pierce it, lightning!

256
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:29,911
Thunder Smasher.

257
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:47,806
Sealing mode, set up.

258
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,417
Sealing form, set up.

259
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:52,206
Jewel Seed, Serial VII...

260
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:54,032
Seal!

261
00:22:09,262 --> 00:22:13,598
It seems that we shouldn't
be jolting the Jewel Seeds.

262
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,759
Yeabh... If something like
last night happened again,

263
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:22,496
I'd feel sorry for both my
Raising Heart and your Bardiche.

264
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:26,845
But I can't give it up.

265
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,016
Device Form.

266
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:34,219
All I want to do is talk with you, Fate.

267
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,300
Device Mode.

268
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:39,123
If I win...

269
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:43,556
If you can understand that
I'm not just a spoiled child,

270
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,980
will you listen to my story?

271
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:06,084
Stop!

272
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,967
Combat here is too dangerous.

273
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:16,261
I'm an Enforcer from the
Time-Space Administration Bureau,

274
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:18,012
Chrono Harlaown.

275
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,237
Would you tell me the
details of this case?

276
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,370
Make a little wish

277
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:30,201
Even though at times
I'll trip or get lost

278
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:41,159
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic

279
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:51,525
Ah, going over the sea of cellophane
and over the forests

280
00:23:53,366 --> 00:23:57,035
Passing through the silver wind

281
00:23:57,036 --> 00:24:01,072
I was looking for something
neither of us had

282
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:06,073
Ah, I was just crying inside
a diorama of a city

283
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,880
Until I met that warm hand that
reached out to me that day

284
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:20,421
Among the swaying days,
I felt a strong gaze

285
00:24:22,595 --> 00:24:27,595
Hey, I finally, finally
found the secret key

286
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:32,637
Make a little wish

287
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:37,268
Collecting the lemon-colored
drops from the moon

288
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:43,577
I want to keep a light shining
on the road that you travel down

289
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,352
Make a little wish

290
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:52,013
I wonder if there is something
I can do even though I'm so little

291
00:24:53,025 --> 00:25:03,315
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic

292
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:15,079
With the emergence of Chrono,
the third mage,

293
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,049
and the truth finally unfolding
concerning the Jewel Seeds,

294
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,518
the plot takes a big step forward?!

295
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:25,519
And I find out something
that is very surprising.

296
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:28,154
Yuuno is... Yuuno is?!
