1
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,148
A sudden incident has befallen me,
Nanoha Takamachi,

2
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:19,140
a girl who was supposed to be
an ordinary third-grader.

3
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:24,307
I accepted the heart of courage,
and I gained magical powers.

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,694
New introductions guided by magic...

5
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:30,035
Are they coincidence, or destiny?

6
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:33,638
Right now, I'm not sure which.

7
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:38,609
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha
is about to begin!

8
00:00:56,657 --> 00:01:00,593
Cradling my knees in
a corner of my room

9
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:03,997
I always shivered from uncertainty

10
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:08,997
I was scared of learning the truth,
so I closed the door

11
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:16,205
I found my own place within a kind lie
and I fled inside my dreams

12
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:23,545
I dye a sea of loneliness that
nobody knows of into a deep blue

13
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:32,087
An intense feeling to
hide the loneliness

14
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,060
Is continually injuring your heart

15
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:44,003
The secret hidden deep
within the eyes

16
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:48,374
To the truth behind the smile
that draws me in

17
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:53,375
I will deliver a love so soft

18
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:58,317
Right now, a warmth that might
break upon touching it

19
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:03,089
Parts itself from the past,
and overflows

20
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,460
I'll be by your side forever

21
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:16,521
Do not be lured into
the somber shadows

22
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,905
The Lost Logia are in this area?

23
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:49,402
The form is a blue gem.

24
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,363
Normally called a Jewel Seed.

25
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,680
Right.

26
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,055
I'll have them in my hands in no time.

27
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:10,992
Episode 4:
A Rival?! Another Magical Girll

28
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,707
Here, Yuuno, over here!

29
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,410
Good job! Yuuno, you're so smart!

30
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:26,809
Still not ready, Nanoha?

31
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:30,058
Sorry! Just a bit longer...

32
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:33,446
Going out somewhere today?

33
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:36,182
Yeah, to the Tsukimuras' house.

34
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:39,652
Apparently, Nanoha got
an invitation from Suzuka.

35
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:40,993
Oh, I see.

36
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:44,965
And you, Kyo, are going
to go see Shinobu.

37
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:49,586
Well, my main purpose
is to chaperone Nanoha.

38
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,132
Sorry to keep you waiting!

39
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:55,094
Then let's go.

40
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,337
We're barely going to
catch the bus as it is.

41
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,572
Okay.

42
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,943
Yuuno, over here!

43
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,061
Okay, see you later!

44
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,093
We're on our way!

45
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,000
Today, we're planning a tea party
at Suzuka's house.

46
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:37,211
I'm going to spend my day off
with Arisa and Suzuka.

47
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:42,592
And my brother is going to go see
Suzuka's older sister Shinobu.

48
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,457
No, it's nothing...

49
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,080
I see.

50
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,812
Welcome, Mr. Kyouya, Miss Nanoha.

51
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,314
Yeah. Thanks for the invitation.

52
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,275
Hello!

53
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:21,320
This is Noel, the head maid
of the Tsukimura family.

54
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,481
She doesn't talk much, but
she's so beautiful and so cool!

55
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,198
Please, this way.

56
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,922
Nanoha, Kyouya!

57
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,123
Suzuka!

58
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:01,856
Nanoha, welcome!

59
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:06,732
This is Falin.
She's Suzuka's personal maid.

60
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,603
She's a very bright and kind lady!

61
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:11,383
Welcome, Kyouya.

62
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,973
Yeah.

63
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:18,344
My brother and Shinobu have been
classmates since high school,

64
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:20,946
and they really get along nowadays.

65
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,677
Shall I go prepare the tea?

66
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,384
What would you like?

67
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,719
I'll leave it up to you.

68
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,321
And for you, Miss Nanoha?

69
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:30,102
I'll leave it up to you too.

70
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:33,492
As you wish. Falin?

71
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,983
Yes, roger, sister.

72
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:41,667
Then Kyouya and I
will be in my room.

73
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,658
Right, I will bring it over there.

74
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:52,311
Morning!

75
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:54,080
Yeah! Morning!

76
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:58,441
Suzuka's sister and Nanoha's brother
are as lovey-dovey as ever!

77
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,117
Yes.

78
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,750
My sister has seemed very happy
ever since she got to know Kyouya.

79
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:12,388
I wonder if it's the same
for my brother?

80
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:21,787
But compared to the past,
I think he's gotten a bit nicer.

81
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,426
I think he laughs a lot more now.

82
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:40,894
Oh, yeah, thanks for
inviting me today.

83
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:46,966
Not at all. Thank you
for coming today.

84
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,187
You seem to be
cheerful enough today.

85
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:54,737
Nanoha, you haven't been
too cheerful lately.

86
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:01,013
If there is something
that is worrying you,

87
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:03,094
we'd like you to tell us.

88
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,171
At least, that's what the
two of us were saying.

89
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:10,926
Suzuka... Arisa...

90
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:23,569
Yuuno!

91
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,171
Ein, stop that!

92
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,473
Here, sorry to keep you waiting!

93
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:30,404
Strawberry milk tea and
cream cheese cookies!

94
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,244
Falin, look out!

95
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,163
Safe!

96
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,913
Suzuka, Nanoha, I'm so sorry!

97
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,181
There she goes again.

98
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,142
That girl is so troublesome.

99
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:35,098
Your house is cat heaven,
just like always, Suzuka.

100
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,513
But the kittens are really cute!

101
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:41,614
Yes...

102
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:44,483
There are a couple of them
that found new parents,

103
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:47,086
so I have to say goodbye to them.

104
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,127
I see. That's a bit lonely.

105
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:56,025
But I'm happy that
the kittens will grow up.

106
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:58,644
I guess so.

107
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:25,558
Nanoha!

108
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,488
Yeah. It's really close by!

109
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:29,445
What should we do?

110
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:32,460
Well...

111
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:35,948
Well...

112
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:37,886
I gotit!

113
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,110
Yuuno?!

114
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,511
Oh, my... Is something
wrong with Yuuno?

115
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,713
Yeah, I think he found something.

116
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:50,249
I'll go look for him!

117
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,084
Would you like us to help?

118
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:55,485
I'm fine. I'll be right back,
so wait here!

119
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,133
It's been executed?!

120
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,570
People will see us here.

121
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,046
I have to create a barrier!

122
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,247
A barrier?

123
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,717
A space like when we first met!

124
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,752
It slightly shifts the flow of time

125
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:29,755
between the space where the magic
takes effect and normal space.

126
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:32,476
I'm pretty good at that magic.

127
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,774
I can't cut out too large of a space,

128
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:42,987
but if it's this house
and its surroundings,

129
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:44,947
I can manage.

130
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:32,131
That's...

131
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:41,036
Most likely, that kitten's wish to
grow has been properly granted.

132
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,421
I see...

133
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,736
But we have to turn it back
to what it was before,

134
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,104
or it will be dangerous.

135
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,806
Right.

136
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:57,527
After all, Suzuka would be
troubled if it stayed that size.

137
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,918
It doesn't seem like
it's going to attack us,

138
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,728
so I guess I should hurry and seal it.

139
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:10,802
Then, Raging Heart!

140
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:22,101
Bardiche, attack with
the Photon Lancer.

141
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:24,411
Photon Lancer, Full Auto Fire.

142
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,454
Magical light?!

143
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,079
No way...

144
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,052
Raging Heart, please!

145
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,043
Stand by ready. Set up.

146
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,245
Flier Fin.

147
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,809
Wide Area Protection.

148
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:05,831
A magic-user?

149
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:23,554
She's not surprised by much now.

150
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:28,227
Maybe there's nothing more
that I can teach Nanoha.

151
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:40,942
A similar type of magic-user.

152
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:45,305
One that searches for the Lost Logia...

153
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:51,394
No doubt about it.
She's from the same world as me.

154
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,594
And she knows the truth
about the Jewel Seeds!

155
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:02,516
The same type of intelligent
device as Bardiche...

156
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,099
Bardiche?

157
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:12,025
Lost Logia, Jewel Seeds.

158
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,269
Scythe Form, set up.

159
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,510
I apologize, but I'm taking it with me.

160
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:38,430
Evasion.

161
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:39,741
Flier Fin.

162
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:53,688
Arc Saber.

163
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,369
Protection.

164
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:00,848
Nanoha!

165
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,251
Why?

166
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,072
Why, so suddenly...

167
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:22,021
Even if I answered, it would
likely be meaningless.

168
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,213
Device Mode.

169
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:30,846
Shooting Mode.

170
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:38,092
Divine Buster, stand by.

171
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,988
Photon Lancer, get set.

172
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,113
I'm sure she's my age.

173
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,917
Pretty eyes, and pretty hair...

174
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,954
But this girl...

175
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:06,554
I'm sorry.

176
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:09,544
Fire.

177
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:17,926
Nanoha!

178
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,836
Sealing Form, set up.

179
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:03,044
Capture.

180
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,165
Order?

181
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:31,066
Lost Logia, Jewel Seed, Serial 14...

182
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:33,772
Seal.

183
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:34,882
Yes, sir.

184
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:57,659
Sealing.

185
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:17,532
Captured.

186
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:11,015
When I woke up again, the sky
had changed color to that of dusk.

187
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:16,226
Yuuno had called for my brother
and everyone else.

188
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:19,911
And I told a small lie,

189
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:24,272
that I tripped and passed out
while searching for Yuuno.

190
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,716
I made everyone worry so much.

191
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:34,496
My heart was full of apologies.

192
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:46,755
That staff, that armor,
how she used magic...

193
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,175
Most likely...

194
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:54,045
No, I'm positive that she lives
in the same world as I do.

195
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,164
Yeah.

196
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,870
If I'm going to collect
more Jewel Seeds...

197
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:05,543
I wonder if I'm going
to run into her again?

198
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:12,966
For some strange reason,
I wasn't scared at all.

199
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:17,514
But it made me feel kind of sad.

200
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:20,657
I had very complicated feelings.

201
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:42,170
There was a bit of interference,
but I was all right.

202
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:46,438
Jewel Seed, Serial 14.

203
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:53,445
I wonder if she has a few of them?

204
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:01,004
It's all right. I won't lose my way.

205
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:10,511
Wait for me, Mother.

206
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,916
I'll be home soon.

207
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:25,537
Make a little wish

208
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:30,338
Even though at times
I'll trip or get lost

209
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:41,324
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic

210
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:51,659
Ah, going over the sea of
cellophane and over the forests

211
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:57,335
Passing through the silver wind

212
00:23:57,336 --> 00:24:01,406
I was looking for something
neither of us had

213
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:06,407
Ah, I was just crying
inside a diorama of a city

214
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:13,047
Until I met that warm hand that
reached out to me that day

215
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:20,554
Among the swaying days,
I felt a strong gaze

216
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:27,762
Hey, I finally, finally
found the secret key

217
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:32,804
Make a little wish

218
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:37,435
Collecting the lemon-colored
drops from the moon

219
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:43,711
I want to keep a light shining on
the road that you travel down

220
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,485
Make a little wish

221
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:52,176
I wonder if there is something I
can do even though I'm so little

222
00:24:53,359 --> 00:25:03,499
Because you're with me, I can
continue to smile and be energetic

223
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,977
Students and working people alike,

224
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,480
at times they just need
a break to relax.

225
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:19,851
And so we're here at the local
resort, Uminari Hot Springs!

226
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:23,855
Just when we're relaxing,
who's getting in our way?!

227
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,790
And what is the
objective and intentions

228
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,870
of that mysterious
magical girl in black?!

229
