Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.83,0:04:30.83,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,That's because...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.24,0:04:32.68,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I feel bad for her.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.65,0:04:35.14,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Well, whatever.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.62,0:04:38.46,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,So, what's our current problem then?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.46,0:04:40.98,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Is it how we're gonna fight Tenshi's clone?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.98,0:04:43.56,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Are you stupid?  It's how we're gonna {\i1}erase{\i0} it.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.64,0:04:47.18,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,But... if she created it on purpose...

Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.26,0:04:47.18,Dialogue-Alt,,0000,0000,0000,,Lemme go!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.08,0:04:50.47,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,there must be a way to erase it on purpose, as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.03,0:04:53.77,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Can't we just wait until she wakes?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.77,0:04:54.87,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Hold on.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.87,0:04:57.86,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,If she summoned it on purpose, would it really do {\i1}this{\i0} to her?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.63,0:05:01.32,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Most likely, she summoned it unconsciously.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.32,0:05:03.22,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,That's why she was unable to erase it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.60,0:05:06.02,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Even if they had to extinguish each other, that's all she could do.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.26,0:05:10.92,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,That thing isn't gonna disappear?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.92,0:05:13.16,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,It's gonna be hanging around this world from now on?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.38,0:05:15.70,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,For now, we're being allowed to remain at large.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.70,0:05:17.65,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,But starting tomorrow, we probably won't be left alone.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.05,0:05:26.06,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.06,0:05:30.22,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Her desire to correct our behavior is still absolutely present.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.60,0:05:42.53,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,How shall we do that?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.92,0:05:46.03,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Go to class, and pretend to pay attention.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.55,0:05:49.94,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Make sure you don't actually concentrate on the teacher, though.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.47,0:05:55.78,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,So just immerse yourself in your own separate activities.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.78,0:05:57.33,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,And separately, try to hold out.
