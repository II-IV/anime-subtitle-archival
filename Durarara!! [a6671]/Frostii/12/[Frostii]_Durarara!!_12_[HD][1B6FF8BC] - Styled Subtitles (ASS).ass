Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.73,0:08:17.84,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,And I only performed plastic surgery on her because she wanted it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.41,0:08:21.77,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Maybe the people working for Yagiri forced her into it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.77,0:08:23.89,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Either way, it's none of my business.

Dialogue: 0,0:09:22.34,0:09:23.70,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,but that doesn't mean your head will too.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:24.53,0:09:25.97,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I've thought about this.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:25.97,0:09:31.33,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Why are you, a fairy, revealing herself to humans?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.79,0:09:37.47,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Didn't you reincarnate into this world because you lost your head?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.47,0:09:41.55,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Then, when you regain your head and your memories,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:41.55,0:09:47.23,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,the time we've spent together will dissolve like smoke, like a mirage.

Dialogue: 0,0:10:24.89,0:10:27.08,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,No, that's precisely why I'm scared.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:27.56,0:10:31.70,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,There's no core in me that governs my death.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:31.70,0:10:34.05,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,My head is that core.

Dialogue: 0,0:10:49.94,0:10:53.41,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Do you believe that I tremble in fear after those nightmares?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:53.41,0:10:57.19,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Because I'm afraid of that, and because I want to have some control over my death,

Dialogue: 0,0:12:34.44,0:12:36.81,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Something like, "Give me your money"?
Dialogue: 0,0:12:37.20,0:12:38.74,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Nope.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:38.74,0:12:41.20,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,This organization doesn't really do anything.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:41.20,0:12:43.71,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It comes from the laziness of a "doll," hence "Dollars." {actually daradara means being lazy/sluggish}
Dialogue: 0,0:12:43.71,0:12:44.70,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,That's it.
