1
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,690
I'll rely on others!

2
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,420
There it is!

3
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,050
So this is...

4
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:12,670
the Dollars?

5
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:13,550
What the hell?!

6
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,840
Don't tell me they're all...

7
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,880
For example...

8
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,180
Marrying me.

9
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,970
You're still keeping our secret.

10
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,020
Celty.

11
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,680
This is more fun than I expected.

12
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,540
Screaming even louder!

13
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,980
I was born here!

14
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,540
Give Celty back!

15
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,910
I have to thank you.

16
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:13,460
If it weren't for you, my sister probably would've locked her in a tiny research lab again.

17
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,820
Yagiri-kun...

18
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,240
Are you okay?

19
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,570
Anyway, return Celty to me.

20
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,650
We need to escape before the cops come.

21
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,490
That doesn't justify your actions!

22
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,460
What do you know about me?

23
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,000
I've been watching her ever since I was a child.

24
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,260
I wanted to liberate her,

25
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,610
give her freedom in this vast world,

26
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,260
and then live together with her.

27
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,820
That's all I've thought about.

28
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,730
It's been the only thing on my mind.

29
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,850
Oh, man...

30
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,800
No one can stop the power of love.

31
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,320
And what's up with you?

32
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,070
You've always relied on the masses.

33
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,550
My love won't be crushed by something like this!

34
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,440
It's futile!

35
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,260
I feel pain, but I choose to ignore it.

36
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,900
My life with Celty has no use for pain!

37
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,220
That's how I can ignore the pain you inflict!

38
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,210
You're nuts!

39
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,150
Stop it!

40
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,550
Please stop it!

41
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,980
Seiji-san can be strict, violent, and strange,

42
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,730
but he's definitely not a bad person!

43
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,340
He already has someone he loves.

44
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,730
<i>No...
He already has someone he loves.

45
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,720
It can't be.

46
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,310
So... don't kill him.

47
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,740
<i>No, no, it can't be!
So... don't kill him.

48
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,740
<i>Wait, she's...

49
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,820
That's not my head!

50
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,080
This girl... Her name is...

51
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,580
Harima Mika-san.

52
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,280
Right?

53
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,090
You're the Harima Mika-san that Yagiri-kun supposedly killed, aren't you?

54
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,340
You're kidding me.

55
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,550
Hey...

56
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,530
That's a lie, isn't it?

57
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,950
I'm so sorry!

58
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,930
Hey, hey! You're in there, aren't you, Seiji-san?

59
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:12,960
I'm here as well today!

60
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,150
Oh, gosh, your door's locked.

61
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,960
How am I supposed to come in?

62
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,940
Hey, are you sleeping?

63
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,940
Say, do you remember?

64
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,780
I sat next to you during the exam.

65
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,280
The guy next to me had a pretty cool name, "Ryuugamine."

66
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,450
Then, when I looked to see who was on my left,

67
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,780
I fell in love with you at first sight!

68
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,650
And you smiled when our eyes met!

69
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,410
So please let me see you!

70
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,080
Pretty, pretty please!

71
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,130
Oh, are you feeling sick?

72
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,560
Is that why you won't open the door?

73
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,230
Then I'll open it for you!

74
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,060
Hang on a moment!

75
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,460
And here we go!

76
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,190
I've investigated you ever since that day.

77
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,600
Your birthday, your family...

78
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,410
S-Seiji-san...

79
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,420
You saw it.

80
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,370
U-Um... I...

81
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,140
I won't tell anyone about this.

82
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,360
U-Um...

83
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,690
I swear!

84
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,570
I'll get in sync with your hobbies, no matter what they are!

85
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,300
S-So...

86
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,180
It's okay.

87
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,800
Seiji-san...

88
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,970
It's okay.

89
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,690
Seiji-san?

90
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,640
It's okay.

91
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,380
I'm sorry!

92
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,730
I wasn't dead!

93
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,920
And then your sister...

94
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,360
Do you want Seiji to love you?

95
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,240
Good girl.

96
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,560
Then...

97
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,400
Then there was this doctor.

98
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,790
He said, "With some plastic surgery and makeup, you can look like that head—

99
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,250
exactly like the head Seiji-san loves."

100
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,370
"Your name is Celty,

101
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,760
because that's the name of the head."

102
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,260
That's why I tried to become Celty for you.

103
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,820
But then, Namie-san said that wasn't enough.

104
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,280
She said that you'd figure it out quickly,

105
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,720
so I had to take pills and undergo surgery to erase my emotions and memories.

106
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,060
But I didn't want to forget anything about you!

107
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,560
<i>Someone who knows my name...
But I didn't want to forget anything about you!

108
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,250
But I didn't want to forget anything about you!

109
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,270
A doctor that knows that I'm a Dullahan...

110
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,990
There's only one person in this city!

111
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,910
I just wanted to be with you!

112
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,280
That's why I went through all this!

113
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,160
No way. You're lying...

114
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,540
Then I'm...

115
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:45,080
Well, you weren't even capable of telling her apart from the real one.

116
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,800
So much for your love.

117
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,760
Nice going.

118
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,550
Seiji-san!

119
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,260
Um...

120
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,980
I think it's pretty amazing that you put your life on the line to get her back.

121
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,920
I misunderstood you.

122
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,550
It's true that her personality has some problems,

123
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,190
but she's not a stalker after all.

124
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,140
You risked your life for her, Yagiri-kun.

125
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,620
I don't think an egotistical person would do that.

126
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,830
It's really amazing to love someone who tried to kill you.

127
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,620
In many ways...

128
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,990
I think you two are really similar.

129
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,250
Welcome back.

130
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,350
"What's the meaning of this?"

131
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,530
And then you'd say,

132
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:46,090
"You knew my head was in that research lab.

133
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,860
You and your father have been helping Yagiri Pharmaceuticals from the very start.

134
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,570
Perhaps your father was the one who stole my head!

135
00:07:54,910 --> 00:08:00,630
You hid that from me, and even performed plastic surgery on that severely injured girl.{not mortally wounded, which implies the wound is irrecoverable}

136
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:05,420
I may be a monster, but you're a monster that feasts on others!"

137
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,750
Something along those lines?

138
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,500
I'll say this now to avoid any misunderstandings:

139
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,730
I don't know if my father stole your head, and I'm not interested in knowing.

140
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,840
And I only performed plastic surgery on her because she wanted it.

141
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,770
Maybe the people working for Yagiri forced her into it.

142
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,890
Either way, it's none of my business.

143
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,880
"Can you read my mind?"

144
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,560
Yes, I can.

145
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,030
I've loved you for twenty years.

146
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,660
Of course I can do that much.

147
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,020
What the hell?

148
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,580
Then why didn't you ever tell me about this?

149
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,790
Because I love you.

150
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,250
That's why I kept quiet.

151
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,760
If you found your head, you'd go somewhere else.

152
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,530
I couldn't bear that.

153
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,260
I'd never say something like, "I'll just give up to make you happy."

154
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,140
This is a war with our love at stake.

155
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,980
I'll never let go of you.

156
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,780
To keep you, I'll use the love and death of others.

157
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,090
And even my own.

158
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:10,840
This might sound like an oxymoron, but I'll even use your feelings.

159
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:19,620
Even if I get my head back, I won't leave you.

160
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,340
You may think that,

161
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,700
but that doesn't mean your head will too.

162
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,970
I've thought about this.

163
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:31,330
Why are you, a fairy, revealing herself to humans?

164
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:37,470
Didn't you reincarnate into this world because you lost your head?

165
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:41,550
Then, when you regain your head and your memories,

166
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:47,230
the time we've spent together will dissolve like smoke, like a mirage.

167
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,520
I'm afraid of that.

168
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,170
Will you believe me?

169
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,290
I will.

170
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,790
To be exact, you're the only one I can believe.

171
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,920
I'm scared too.

172
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,790
I'm scared of death.

173
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,050
I'm aware that no one can kill me right now.

174
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,670
I'm not boasting.

175
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,480
I've accepted this as a simple fact.

176
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,810
I'm not happy or thrilled about it.

177
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,890
But...

178
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,080
No, that's precisely why I'm scared.

179
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,700
There's no core in me that governs my death.

180
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,050
My head is that core.

181
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,080
If someone destroys my head,

182
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,870
then I will, regardless of the situation and any decision I'd like to make...

183
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,660
Do you believe me?

184
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,500
Although I lack eyes and a brain, I have nightmares.

185
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,410
Do you believe that I tremble in fear after those nightmares?

186
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,190
Because I'm afraid of that, and because I want to have some control over my death,

187
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,760
I've been searching for my head.

188
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,760
Would you believe me if I said that?

189
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,200
Didn't I tell you?

190
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,170
You're the only one I believe.

191
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,080
I'm totally confused.

192
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,310
We were just being stubborn because of stupid assumptions.

193
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,480
That's so dumb.

194
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,600
Say, Shinra.

195
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,370
Yes?

196
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,090
Let me punch you.

197
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,990
Sure.

198
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,380
Then let me hit you as well.

199
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,420
See.

200
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,350
You're prettiest without your helmet.

201
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,010
That punch was my pledge of a marriage kiss.

202
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,130
Are you crying?

203
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,460
That was really unexpected.

204
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,260
Hey, Izaya.

205
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,310
'Sup, Dotachin. Fancy seeing you here.

206
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,890
Stop calling me that.

207
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,950
Hey, do you know where the name "Dollars" came from?

208
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,810
Something like, "Give me your money"?

209
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,740
Nope.

210
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,200
This organization doesn't really do anything.

211
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,710
It comes from the laziness of a "doll," hence "Dollars." {actually daradara means being lazy/sluggish}

212
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,700
That's it.

213
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,450
Dotachin! Did you see that?!

214
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,640
The black bike!

215
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,350
Man, was that for real?!

216
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,230
So I wasn't hallucinating!

217
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,430
Does that mean it was CG?

218
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,540
That CG is part of the Dollars.

219
00:12:59,370 --> 00:12:59,670
Wowzers!

220
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,300
Really?
Wowzers!

221
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:00,950
Wowzers!

222
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,800
Wowzers! Wowzers!

223
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,030
To be honest, I'm really surprised.

224
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:13,640
I knew a lot of people on the Internet claimed to be part of the Dollars.

225
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:19,330
But I didn't expect so many of them to gather just because someone said to.

226
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,820
Humans never cease to amaze me.

227
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:27,680
Oh, you might dream about escaping your ordinary life,

228
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,700
but life here in Tokyo becomes ordinary after about six months.

229
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,760
If you want more excitement, you could try wandering off to some other country,

230
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,210
or get involved with something underground.

231
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:44,550
But even that would probably become ordinary after three days.

232
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:51,180
If you truly want to escape your ordinary life, you have to continue evolving.

233
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,930
Whether your goal is is above you or below you.

234
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,560
Just enjoy your days.

235
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:58,940
Oh...

236
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:05,830
To show my respect, I'll give you Yagiri Namie's phone number as a freebie.

237
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:09,430
And I won't sell the information that you're the founder of the Dollars.

238
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,680
It's your organization.

239
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,430
You should use it whenever you want.

240
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,670
Izaya!

241
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,630
It's time to go.

242
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,430
Good luck, Tanaka Tarou-kun!

243
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,640
Wait, you punkass!

244
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,410
Izaya!

245
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,020
Huh? It couldn't be.

246
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:47,900
The next day was painfully ordinary.

247
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,650
For him...

248
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,200
and for him...

249
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,250
and for that boy as well.

250
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,330
Hey, Mikado.

251
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,840
I saw it on the Net.

252
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,120
The Dollars gathered last night!

253
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,320
And... and... Shizuo and Simon are both members of the Dollars!

254
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,960
And the rider of the black bike has no head and drove down a building.

255
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,030
Then she hocus-pocused a scythe and boom, there was black fog everywhere!

256
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,690
It was so frickin' awesome, man!

257
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,050
You're not making any sense.

258
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,990
And for them as well.

259
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,990
I don't love you.

260
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:22,560
But as long as I see your face, I won't forget that I love her.

261
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,190
That's why I'll accept your love...

262
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,220
until I get her back.

263
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,430
'Sup, guys.

264
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,500
Hey! I've been waiting.

265
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,560
Ah, thanks.

266
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,340
I'm kind of sleepy tonight, so I'll pass out a bit early.

267
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,050
Not enough sleep? How come? Did you pull an all-nighter?

268
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,460
Yeah, something like that.

269
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,630
Looks like Kanra-san isn't here yet.

270
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,140
I wonder if he'll come.

271
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,850
Argh, something came up.

272
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,140
I see.

273
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,270
Sorry, I've got to go.

274
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,580
Later.

275
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,880
Sorry for being a party pooper.

276
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,940
There's an urgent job.

277
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,070
No problem.

278
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,030
And so, my life went back to normal.

279
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:18,450
As always, I still run into people I don't want to see.

280
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,900
You seem relieved.

281
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:27,130
People are afraid of ghosts because they sneak around and stuff.

282
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,860
But you gave such a fancy performance there.

283
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,450
No one will fear you anymore.

284
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,720
Oh yeah, you ended up not killing anyone.

285
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,930
What's with that scythe? It can't cut anything?

286
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,630
Or are you still looking for that girl?

287
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,860
Let me know when you need my help.

288
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,020
Just give me a call.

289
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,900
Bye.

290
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,890
I don't know where Yagiri Namie is.

291
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,520
Not that I care.

292
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,950
I'm me.

293
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,400
There's nothing I need.

294
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,280
The days have returned to normal.

295
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,280
Normal days without hope or despair.

296
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,800
The same old thing.

297
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,370
Yet, I feel so... full.

298
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,370
I'm here.

299
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,110
And you're there.

300
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:13,380
If I'm your salvation, then you're mine.

301
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:22,120
And the boy falls into deep thought about Orihara Izaya's words.

302
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:28,880
Would he, who wishes for an impossible reality, be able to find a new reality that lasts forever?

303
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,430
More so, would that eternity just become part of his everyday life again?

304
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,150
I'm sorry for what I did.

305
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:36,950
Thanks.

306
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,950
Hey! That's my place.

307
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,470
There's an empty seat behind the class rep.

308
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,010
What the hell?

309
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,010
You come out of nowhere and take my seat.

310
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:03,510
She most likely won't hang out with Harima Mika anymore.

311
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:08,620
Only she knows whether that's good or bad.

312
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,460
But is it true?

313
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,430
Is it true that people don't understand their own feelings?

314
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,200
"You have to continue to evolve."

315
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,660
That man's words still echo in his head.

316
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:25,410
The boy thought he was capable of anything after such a bold act.

317
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,820
But he didn't know...

318
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:34,670
how much courage he needed to ask his female classmate out.

319
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,180
Thirty seconds till he sees her.

320
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:48,310
Thirty-five seconds till he sees his best friend hitting on her.

321
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:52,560
Forty-five seconds till he kicks his best friend away.

322
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:57,070
Seventy-four seconds till the girl declines his offer.

323
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:02,570
Seventy-eight seconds till the girl asks him to join her for lunch on the roof.

324
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,200
How long will it take for him to fall in love with her?

325
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,960
How long will it take for him to confess?

326
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,440
You sure did something silly there, huh?

327
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:24,370
You sacrificed everything for your brother's twisted love.

328
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,050
Oh, or should I say, your twisted love for your brother?

329
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,000
Anyway, don't things look grim for you?

330
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,060
Nebula is merging with your company.

331
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,570
You know, if you leave with that,

332
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:50,600
the mafia, or some skilled sniper, will put a hole between your eyebrows.

333
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,480
Checkmate!

334
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,250
A garbage truck?

335
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,160
Yes, the usual collectors.

336
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,980
Roger.

337
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,070
Hello?

338
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,260
Things got a bit complicated.

339
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,280
Can you leave that room?

340
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,700
Can't they make a rule where the kings fight one-on-one?

341
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,370
I think your uncle was like me.

342
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:22,500
Not believing in the next world, fearing death more than anyone else,

343
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,410
and thirsting for Heaven.

344
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,580
However, I'm certain now:

345
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,230
The next world exists.

346
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,660
Let's leave it at that.

347
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,870
Usually Dullahans are female.

348
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,590
Do you know why?

349
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,980
No.

350
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,890
The researchers were looking into it,

351
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,590
but I thought it was a complete waste of time.

352
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,920
So you're a rationalist.

353
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,820
Anyway, putting that aside,

354
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,450
there's a heaven called "Valhalla."

355
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,310
Well, not exactly.

356
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,890
In Norse mythology, armored female angels called Valkyries

357
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,900
guide the souls of gallant warriors to Valhalla.

358
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,370
A woman comes to pick up the dead.

359
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,820
Doesn't that sound familiar?

360
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:09,750
They say that Valkyries are Dullahans.

361
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,960
If that's true, I'm sure this is waiting for it.

362
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,330
For its awakening.

363
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,700
For the clocks to sound war.

364
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,710
To find the sacred warrior she'll invite to Valhalla.

365
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:24,490
The reason it doesn't open its eyes, even though it's alive, is because this isn't a battlefield.

366
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,240
I'd love to be chosen, if possible.

367
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:33,470
What should I do if Valhalla, the afterlife, really exists?

368
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,580
I doubt I'd excel on the battlefield.

369
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,500
Then maybe I'll start a war that only I can fight.

370
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,480
Right?

371
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,810
Man, I'm such a lucky bastard.

372
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:48,980
Without believing in Heaven, I've lived a life equivalent to it.

373
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,460
And I even met the fallen Angel of Death too.

374
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,300
These are merely your deductions.

375
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,320
"Believe, and thou shalt be saved."

376
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,980
And this is just for insurance.

377
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:03,450
Even if it's Hell, where only torment awaits me...

378
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,190
I don't care as long as I can live there.

379
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:11,090
But if possible, I'd love to go to Heaven.

380
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,900
So Namie-san,

381
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,330
let's all go to Heaven!

382
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:19,010
I'll keep this as a member of the Dollars.

383
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,430
Hide a tree in the forest.

384
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:26,040
I doubt Celty would think that her head is in the same organization as she is.

385
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:29,200
Oh, hey. Why don't you join the Dollars too?

386
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,320
Our leader is like, "Invite whoever comes near you."

387
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,760
Though I was the one who started recruiting people halfway through.

388
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,840
Let's make the fallen angel fly again.

389
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:44,820
Right?

390
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:18,310
Nothing happens in her ordinary life.

391
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,200
Nothing changes.

392
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,100
Even though something new is born in the city every day,

393
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,560
while something else disappears.

394
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,360
Next time: Sudden Turn.
