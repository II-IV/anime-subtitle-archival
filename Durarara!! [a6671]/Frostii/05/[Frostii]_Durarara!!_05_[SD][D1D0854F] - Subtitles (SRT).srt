1
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,840
I'm Ryuugamine Mikado.

2
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,790
Whoa!

3
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,710
Is it really you, Kida-kun?!

4
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,550
There aren't as many color gang members as before.

5
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,550
Most of them got arrested for starting a gang war in Saitama.

6
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:19,970
I'm Sonohara Anri.

7
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,430
Nice to meet you all.

8
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,430
Harima-san!

9
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,240
I'm sorry! I thought you were someone else!

10
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,230
If you pledge to be a bona fide Ikebukuronian,

11
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,310
you will overcome this ordeal!

12
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,120
I found...

13
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,530
my love!

14
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,860
I-I'm sorry!

15
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,650
Really!

16
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,730
I'll give it back! So please!

17
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,950
Please forgive me.

18
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,590
Sheesh!

19
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,510
I'm really pissed!

20
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,270
It's my fault, Selty.

21
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,850
It's all because I accepted such a stupid job.

22
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,560
The job itself was supposed to be quick.

23
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,020
But then that thing just appeared.

24
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,580
You are not human!

25
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,250
Monster! Monster!

26
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,380
You monster!

27
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,210
You heard voices from your wound?

28
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,720
They called me a monster!

29
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,500
How rude!

30
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,610
They could have at least called you a "devil woman" or something.

31
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,840
What the hell was that thing?

32
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,980
What do I do if it's an alien?!

33
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,480
Selty...

34
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,130
Am I supposed to laugh about this?

35
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,070
M-Monster!

36
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,570
Let's go!

37
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:51,530
Apparently, this city is made of jokes, coincidences, and whims.

38
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,230
This situation might be a result of God's whims, or maybe it's just one of his jokes.

39
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,220
I fell in love at first sight with 37 girls during the opening ceremony,

40
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,230
and even though I'm going home with the bespectacled girl that's in my top five,

41
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:16,650
because of some development that would put soap operas to shame...

42
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,180
the mood's ruined by some dumbass.

43
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,370
Screw this...

44
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,870
It was pretty hectic last time, right?

45
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,450
Y-Yeah.

46
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,380
This ain't going anywhere.

47
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,860
Dude, you really surprised me back then.

48
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,880
I didn't expect you to take the initiative.

49
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,130
Th-That's not true!

50
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,610
No way! Mikado!

51
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,420
But in the end, you saved me.

52
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,320
I wouldn't have wasted such an opportunity if I were in your shoes.

53
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,140
By now, we'd be in WGP talking so romantically about love...

54
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,520
So please go out with me!

55
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,520
Kida-kun!

56
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,750
Um... I—

57
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,420
Nah, you don't have to reply right now.

58
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,550
I'm waiting on a reply from seven other girls,

59
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,530
and I'm trying to make up my mind on who to date.

60
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,660
Sonohara-san, you don't have to take him seriously.

61
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,210
You'll just wear yourself out.

62
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,550
Plus he talks like a big playboy, but he's really just a peanut.

63
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,840
Even when he hits on girls—

64
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,100
Hey, Mikado!

65
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,580
This guy, known as Ryuugamine Mikado, is my best friend.

66
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,170
It's only been a couple of days since he came to Ikebukuro.

67
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,080
He's an honest, naïve guy with an unexpected stubborn side.

68
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,180
Thus, I just can't leave him alone.

69
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,890
And I'm stuck in a love triangle with this pure-hearted boy.

70
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,940
Is this what they call "youth"?

71
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,940
You two seem to get along pretty well.

72
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,630
Of course.

73
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,530
We're so close we're inseparable.

74
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,360
To explain this situation...

75
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,580
We have to go back to the opening ceremony.

76
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,010
I'm Yagiri Seiji.

77
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,710
Nice to meet you all.

78
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:02,020
Take your seat, Yagiri.

79
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,000
I won't.

80
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,150
I don't think I'll be able to come to school for a while.

81
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,390
Nah, perhaps I'll never come back.

82
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,210
I have to take care of something very important to me.

83
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,990
I can't deal with you people.

84
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,770
Bye.

85
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,400
H-Hey, Yagiri!

86
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,210
Wait!

87
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,730
Wait, I said!

88
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,540
I thought, "There are so many weirdos running around,"

89
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,200
Yagiri! Wait!
I thought, "There are so many weirdos running around,"

90
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,530
when Mikado told me about it.
Yagiri! Wait!

91
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,240
when Mikado told me about it.

92
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,530
Please wait!

93
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:34,800
That was literally the moment when I fell in love.

94
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,540
My heart gave a big ba-dump when I saw her cute smile.

95
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,710
Oh wait, she didn't smile.

96
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,250
Leave me alone!

97
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,000
Wait!

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,290
Hey.

99
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,780
Is something wrong?

100
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:54,950
And thus she claimed the top spot of my "girls I'm gonna make my girlfriend" list.

101
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,680
And today...

102
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,080
Hey, Sonohara.

103
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,420
Are you heading home?

104
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,360
Yes.

105
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,900
Say, Sonohara.

106
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,730
Is something bothering you?

107
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:17,060
You aren't in trouble, or getting bullied, are you?

108
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,990
No.

109
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,790
Come talk to me if something happens.

110
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,480
I'm fine.

111
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,470
Well, if you say so.

112
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,160
Oh yeah, Harima still hasn't come back?

113
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,470
You two were in the same class back then.

114
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:35,970
It wasn't easy to get you two in the same class here too.

115
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,660
Your junior high teacher, Saitou-sensei, told me to take good care of you.

116
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,490
So you don't have to be polite with me, okay?

117
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,940
Oh yeah, I'll give you a ride home.

118
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,980
Did you hear about it?

119
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,050
There was another slasher incident in Ikebukuro.

120
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,990
Whoa, Nasujima-sensei, is that sexual harassment I see there?

121
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,430
Wowzers! You even made the timid, pure, bespectacled class rep moan.

122
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,040
This is literally sexual harassment, isn't it?

123
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,040
Or with a Russian accent, "Sexy kharasho"?

124
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,430
Cut that out, Kida!

125
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,880
Sonohara, don't get the wrong idea and start silly rumors.

126
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,960
Does she look like such a frivolous girl?

127
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,510
Yeah, she doesn't.

128
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,890
Seriously, you have to tone your jokes down.

129
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,230
No worries. I'll be the one spreading the rumors.

130
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,560
I guess I was like a Champion of Justice.

131
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,280
Shit, that was so cool of me.

132
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,290
She's so gonna be head-over-heels for me.

133
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,670
Kida-kun?

134
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,620
Sonohara-san?

135
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,620
Nice fucking timing.

136
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,620
Sorry for the wait.

137
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,170
Here you go.

138
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,460
Thanks.

139
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,670
Hey, you should really watch out.

140
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,680
Most of the rumors about Nasujima are just that,

141
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,790
but it's true that he went after a student:

142
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,410
A sophomore named Niekawa Haruna.

143
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,960
She transferred out during second semester last year.

144
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,270
People almost found out that she was dating Nasujima.

145
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,450
Are you serious?

146
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,370
It's unknown if she made the decision herself, if she was threatened by Nasujima,

147
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,110
or if the school forced her to transfer.

148
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,940
Well, if anything happens, Mikado and I will save you.

149
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,790
Right, Mikado?

150
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,620
Oh, yeah.

151
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,930
I still don't really get the whole story,

152
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,080
but I'll do anything to help you.

153
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,970
Silly.

154
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,540
You're supposed to say, "I'll make the impossible possible with the power of love."

155
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,020
Otherwise you're not a man.

156
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,800
Really?

157
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,130
That's an oxymoron.

158
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,280
It's just appropriate in that situation.

159
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,100
That aside, about the other day...

160
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,330
Those bullies went to the same junior high as you, right?

161
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,140
H-How did you know that?

162
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,440
Well, that's what it sounded like from your conversation.

163
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,910
In junior high, someone with authority was helping you,

164
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,810
but since that person's gone now, they started bullying you again.

165
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,340
Oh, what was it?

166
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,240
You still can't find your missing friend?

167
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,290
It's Harima Mika-san, right?

168
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:11,140
It's not that she's been absent,

169
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,500
but she never went home until the entrance ceremony.

170
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,800
Hey, isn't that something for the cops?

171
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,230
She texted me, and she also told her family.

172
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:25,150
It said, "I'm taking a little trip to relax. Please don't worry about me."

173
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,400
A trip to relax?

174
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,530
Did something happen?

175
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,160
Well...

176
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,520
Can you listen without getting shocked?

177
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,220
Everything in the past few days has made me immune to any kind of shock.

178
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,280
Harima-san...

179
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,610
is a stalker.

180
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,940
I see.

181
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,540
So the guy you were badgering with questions the other day...

182
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,650
He's the one being stalked—

183
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:53,340
No, rather, Mika-chan, who wanted to be loved by him but was rejected, took a trip to forget her bitter experience.

184
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,140
It's best to leave it to her family to handle that.

185
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,420
If things get worse, they'll call the police.

186
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,180
Were you two good friends?

187
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,180
What's up with that question?

188
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,890
Well, we were always together.

189
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,900
He's pretty sharp when it comes to certain things.

190
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,810
I'm really clumsy, and not sociable.

191
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,200
But it was always Mika-san that helped me out.

192
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,800
She went as far as going to the same school as I did,

193
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,240
and it felt very awkward for me.

194
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,510
Well...

195
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:33,050
"She didn't want to let go of you because you made her look better."

196
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,930
Even if you think that, you shouldn't say it out loud, Mikado-kun.

197
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,730
I know.

198
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,460
Know what?

199
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,840
That I was just being used by Mika-san to make herself look better.

200
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,030
But I was using her too.

201
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,690
It's easier to depend on someone else.

202
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,310
I didn't think I'd be able to live if I didn't.

203
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:56,150
But I don't think I need her anymore.

204
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,950
I got used to it.

205
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,870
I decided to be the class representative

206
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,740
just because she wanted to do it too.

207
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,800
I thought, "At least I can do it in her stead."

208
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:13,970
I thought, "I can surpass her if I become class rep."

209
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,110
I'm so despicable.

210
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,590
I think it's even more despicable to tell other people about this.

211
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,760
It sounds like you're asking for forgiveness.

212
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,890
Surpassing her is the right decision.

213
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:34,270
So, why don't you face it straight up?

214
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,980
E-Er...

215
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,990
You're right.

216
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,610
Thank you.

217
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,830
I really like this part of him.

218
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,500
Kida-kun!

219
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,880
That's so lame!

220
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,360
Oh, yeah?!

221
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,410
What? The strongest in Ikebukuro?

222
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,020
Yes, the strongest.

223
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,470
Are you a journalist?

224
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,250
What do you mean by "strongest"? It sounds so silly.

225
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,630
Well, the strongest is the guy on the black bike.

226
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,430
Yeah, I've heard of him.

227
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,270
The headless one, right?

228
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,510
You've got to be kidding me!

229
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,940
Oh, and then there's the slasher.

230
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,480
Yeah, him.

231
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,290
But the strongest in this city would be the Dollars.

232
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,110
Dollars?

233
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,990
Yes, Dollars!

234
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,930
My home's the other way.

235
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,940
Thanks for today.

236
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,110
See you tomorrow.

237
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,780
Bye-bye, Anri-chan!

238
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,790
I've been thinking...

239
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:36,580
I think Yagiri-kun and Mika are together.

240
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,390
The victim and the stalker?

241
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,690
Like Yagiri-kun has been kidnapped by his stalker.

242
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,550
That makes sense.

243
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,080
Searching for someone, eh?

244
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,060
What should we do?

245
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,380
Forget about it.

246
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,070
She said it was fine, right?

247
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,860
I guess it's impossible to find them without the help of an organization or something like that.

248
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,560
Like the Dollars.

249
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,850
Mikado... You aren't thinking about joining them, are you?

250
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,850
Of course not.

251
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,640
Seriously, forget about it.

252
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,220
The foolishness of youth makes people join color gangs,

253
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,110
and then they end up regretting it.

254
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,610
Yeah, but we're still young.

255
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:16,440
I was really depressed before Mikado came here.

256
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:22,440
I can be this cheerful thanks to a lot of people.

257
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,550
Including Mikado.

258
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:30,550
He was innocent when he came here, so the heated atmosphere of this city is getting to him.

259
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,170
It pains me to see him acting so cautiously.

260
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:35,530
Well, I could splash some water on him,

261
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:40,080
but when I see the glimmer in his eyes, I just can't do it.

262
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,750
That's why I'm trying to spend as much time as I can with him.

263
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:49,570
If I could, I'd do anything to prevent him from getting near the dark side of this city.

264
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,550
I too...

265
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:54,870
Bang.

266
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,420
...swore never to go back there again.

267
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,710
Is someone spamming the channel with crap?

268
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,040
Sounds like an alien.

269
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,250
Maybe he's laughing.

270
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,590
So scary...

271
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,380
I mean the "haha hahas."

272
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,640
No, I'm not saying aliens are scary.

273
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,140
Tsumiuta?

274
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,390
Or Zaika?

275
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,390
"Wealth"?

276
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,310
I'll take a look at it later.

277
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,740
Anyway, you've got a job, Selty.

278
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,960
It's from Shiki-san of the Awakusu Group again.

279
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,610
It's not a very pleasant job though.

280
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,870
Will you do it?

281
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,400
Another delivery?

282
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,220
Yeah.

283
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,740
Well, you have to get the stolen goods back first though.

284
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,010
I have no idea what the goods are.

285
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,460
I think it's better not to know.

286
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,750
I know.

287
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,860
So, about the goods...

288
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,320
The thief's on the run.

289
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,580
We have an idea on his location, so we should be able to corner him easily.

290
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:34,950
Roger.

291
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,930
The slasher has been quite active lately, so be careful.

292
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,940
The slasher?

293
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,710
Yeah, dude.

294
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,050
Looks like he appeared again.

295
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,690
He just slashes people without killing them.

296
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,240
Well, you can't call him the strongest then.

297
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,700
The strongest in this city would be...

298
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,570
Simon from Russia Sushi.

299
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:00,080
What about the informant that moved to Shinjuku?

300
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,580
Orihara Izaya.

301
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,000
Then it has to be that guy...

302
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,830
Heiwajima Shizuo!

303
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,810
The strongest color gang?

304
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,650
Dude, it's the Dollars.

305
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,250
They don't have a color.

306
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,380
Those peeps in yellow were the big shots until last year though.

307
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,280
Yellow?

308
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,810
Yeah, the Yellow Napkins.

309
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:25,970
But I heard that they fought the Blue Squares last year, and they wrecked each other.

310
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:29,250
Dude, I heard they revived recently.

311
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,400
Please don't stop the orders from comin'!

312
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,070
Engawa and scallops are really cheap!

313
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,320
Speaking of which, haven't they stuck out too much recently?
Engawa and scallops are really cheap!

314
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,410
Speaking of which, haven't they stuck out too much recently?

315
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,620
Who?

316
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,930
The yellow guys?

317
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,470
Oh, so you noticed them.

318
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,830
By yellow, you don't happen to mean...

319
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,790
Yellow Snapkins!

320
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,020
You mean "Yellow Napkins."

321
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,200
Yep, yep, them.

322
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,920
That was Hermes, right?

323
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,330
No, they were annihilated in the fight with the Blue Squares.

324
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,040
Oh, right.

325
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,890
I heard their boss went AWOL.

326
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,550
Welcome!

327
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,100
Could you tell me about the Dollars?

328
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,900
One of my friends wants to join them, and I want to stop him.

329
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,530
Why are you asking us?

330
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:18,240
There's no one else I can ask.

331
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,570
He can't just go to Orihara Izaya obviously.

332
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,980
We don't know that much about them either,

333
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,350
but we'll tell you everything we know.

334
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,820
Sometimes I feel like I'm getting sucked in by this town.

335
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,160
But Mikado, I won't let you go to that side.

336
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,730
Mikado?!

337
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,740
Sorry.

338
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,610
That won't work, bro.

339
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,660
We're Yellow Napkins, ya see?

340
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,950
Yagiri-kun!

341
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,790
Huh?

342
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,170
That's not Harima Mika.

343
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,970
I don't know who you are, but please don't get in the way of our elopement of love.

344
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,090
Elopement of what?

345
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,390
Shall we go?

346
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,600
So, who was that?

347
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,270
Kida-kun.

348
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,490
Are you guys really from the Yellow Napkins?

349
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,160
Isn't that obvious, Sherlock?

350
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,230
I'm asking because I don't know.

351
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,220
You fucking...

352
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,160
K-Kida-kun!

353
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,130
Oh man, Mikado-kun... Why are you here?

354
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,010
M-Monster!

355
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:08,970
Let's go!

356
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,630
Sheesh dude, stop worrying me.

357
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,240
That's my line.

358
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,100
Perhaps I'm the one relying on him in the end.
That's my line.

359
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,510
Yeah.
Perhaps I'm the one relying on him in the end.

360
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,930
Perhaps I'm the one relying on him in the end.

361
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,430
Ever since Mikado came here, I've felt that my bravado is actually becoming more than just show.

362
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,840
Maybe this time I can meet her without running away.

363
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,400
Come in.

364
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,460
That's what I really think.

365
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,190
I didn't think you'd come,

366
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:09,950
Izaya-san.

367
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:10,910
Hey.

368
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,670
How's he doing?

369
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:17,420
He visits me from time to time.

370
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,090
He was just here.

371
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,100
I'm home.

372
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,150
Haruna, did you eat already?

373
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,480
Haruna.

374
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,330
Oh, I blacklisted that spammer.

375
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,080
Looks like it's gonna be peaceful here.

376
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,750
I hope so.

377
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:59,250
Oh yeah. I heard that some of the Yellow Napkins
got their asses kicked by the slasher yesterday.

378
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,170
Who are the Yellow Napkins?

379
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,500
I wonder if the slasher is a henchman of the Dollars?

380
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,050
What? Really?!

381
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,010
Looks like this might turn into a war.

382
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,150
Things that happen in this city might seem unrelated at first glance,

383
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,170
but I'm sure there's a link somewhere.

384
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,980
Maybe this city holds a distorted reality that's beyond our ability to fathom.

385
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,190
However...

386
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,720
Good morning!

387
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,660
G-Good morning, Sonohara-san.

388
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,240
Good morning.
I just realized this,

389
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,630
but I really like our relationship the way it is now.

390
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,990
One day I'll connect the dots,

391
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:39,130
and unveil the picture that's currently invisible to us.

392
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:43,890
I believe that our relationship will stay the same.

393
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,640
Dollars?

394
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,560
Well, I can't say much about them.

395
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:23,690
Anyway, let me fill you in about the details of the now-legendary Kaztano Incident.

396
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,880
Next time: On the Move.

397
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,140
However, do not call me "Dotachin."
