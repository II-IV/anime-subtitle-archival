1
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,210
No way!

2
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,840
Was that the trash can from the convenience store?

3
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,840
Anyway, don't go near Heiwajima Shizuo.

4
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,050
Jeez, when you get violent, no logic or reason reaches you, Shizu-chan.

5
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,780
Didn't I tell you never to come back to Ikebukuro?

6
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,890
Shizuo, it's not good to fight.

7
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,270
Shut up!

8
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,430
What? The strongest in Ikebukuro?

9
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,480
Then it has to be that guy...

10
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,570
Heiwajima Shizuo!

11
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,820
They fired me without warning!

12
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,990
I've been kicked out of the dorm too.

13
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,570
They didn't even give me severance pay!

14
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,780
I don't have money for food or anything else.

15
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,370
And the state hasn't even done anything!

16
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:09,950
Yeah! It's all the state's fault!

17
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,120
Shut up already...
Yeah! It's all the state's fault!

18
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,550
Yeah! It's all the state's fault!

19
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,320
So you took out a loan to bang a prostitute?

20
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,420
It's love!

21
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,880
Mint-chan and I are truly in love.

22
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,770
What?

23
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,600
Shut up!

24
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,400
We can only meet here, and I don't know her cell phone number.

25
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,750
But our love is genuine!

26
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,460
That's it!

27
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,960
You can only meet here?

28
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,130
And you don't even know her cell phone number?

29
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,420
H-Hey! Shizuo!
And you don't even know her cell phone number?

30
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,730
Let me be clear from the start:

31
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,540
"True love"...

32
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,220
my...

33
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,880
ass!

34
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,400
I hate violence.

35
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,190
Did you hear?

36
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,450
That Heiwajima Shizuo guy has been
causing quite the uproar lately.

37
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:01,910
What?

38
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:06,620
Isn't Heiwajima Shizuo-san the guy
who dresses like a bartender?

39
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,370
Yeah.

40
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,040
People say he's pretty scary, but he's
been particularly aggressive lately.

41
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,590
They say Ikebukuro is like a battlefield!

42
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,890
I've seen him before...

43
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,010
Uh... I guess he's a pretty scary person.

44
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,190
I dunno.

45
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,260
You shouldn't pass judgment just because of some rumors.

46
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,930
Oh my, Setton-san, you know him?

47
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,940
Don't tell me you're from their world?

48
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,770
Scary! Help me, Mommy!

49
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,110
I am not!

50
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,880
Sheesh dude, how are we going to collect debts if you beat the crap out of everyone?

51
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,820
Sorry.

52
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,910
It stinks...

53
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,040
Apparently, he hasn't been home for a few days.

54
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,290
This has happened a lot recently.

55
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,610
Was he a victim of those rumored kidnappings?

56
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,840
Something stinks...

57
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,640
Hey, someone's been injured!

58
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,520
I heard it was the slasher.

59
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,730
This happened just a few minutes ago?!

60
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,950
I saw him!

61
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,320
He ran that way.

62
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,240
Oh boy. Ikebukuro has gotten pretty lively again.

63
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,280
Something stinks!

64
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,290
Something really stinks! The whole city stinks!

65
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,260
What is this smell?

66
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,050
This is so annoying!

67
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,800
Hi, Shizuo, Tom-san.

68
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,360
Hey, Simon.

69
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,780
Shizuo.

70
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,870
Sorry about him.

71
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,680
He's been in a terrible mood the past few days.

72
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,830
Oh... Did he hit puberty?

73
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,050
More like the rebellious phase.

74
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,710
Rebellious phase?

75
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,560
Hey, long time no see.

76
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,790
He's starring in another movie?

77
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,560
Hanejima Yuuhei is a real star, huh?

78
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,430
Or should I say, Heiwajima Kasuka-san?

79
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,240
Aren't you proud of him as his older brother,

80
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,930
Heiwajima Shizuo-san?

81
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,150
Ah, excuse me.

82
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,070
This is my card.

83
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,830
He's not just handsome, but a skilled actor as well.

84
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,080
What was the name of his debut film?

85
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,440
Ah, right.

86
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,580
"Vampire Ninja Carmilla Saizou."

87
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,450
Ever since I saw that movie, I knew he'd be a star.

88
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,140
He performed all his stunts himself, right?

89
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,890
Some speculate that you trained him.

90
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,150
I'd like to ask you more about this.

91
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,650
Shizuo!

92
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,580
I hate violence.

93
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,150
I'm not lying.

94
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,180
I wasn't like this before.

95
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,390
The first time it happened, I was having a fight with my brother Kasuka.

96
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:03,650
I lost my temper over something trivial and picked up the refrigerator all gung-ho to throw at him.

97
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,290
Picking it up wasn't a conscious decision on my part.

98
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,790
It's just that...

99
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,200
I couldn't help myself.

100
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,330
Ever since then...

101
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,810
Boo! Shizuo, you bedwetter!

102
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,300
Dumbass! Dumbass!

103
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,600
I couldn't stay calm.

104
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,020
My body moves on its own when I'm angry.

105
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,690
And then...

106
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,580
You know the brute strength you unleash in extreme situations?

107
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,670
I wonder if you can let it out whenever you want?

108
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:15,260
A person's brain usually keeps their strength in check so they don't
overexert themselves and break their bones or tear their muscles.

109
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,930
But <i>your</i>  brain lets your strength go wild! {Extra space for aesthetics. -des}

110
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,200
That's a mystery of life!

111
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,390
It's just jaw-dropping!

112
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,130
Hey, can I take a peek—

113
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,190
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

114
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,740
It hurts!

115
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,230
It hurts, Shizuo-kun!

116
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,690
It's gonna break!
I don't understand the details.

117
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,630
It's gonna break!

118
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,430
My ulna... my ulna...
But the fact is, I can't control my anger.

119
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:36,890
Thus, I end up destroying everything around me,
My ulna... my ulna...

120
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,440
Thus, I end up destroying everything around me,

121
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,440
My right ulna...
including my own body.

122
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,330
including my own body.

123
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,580
I came to understand that much.

124
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,340
And so...

125
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,420
I didn't keep it bottled up anymore.

126
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,480
If I couldn't control it, then there was no point in trying to suppress it in the first place.

127
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,820
I'll break my bones?

128
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,140
The hell if I care!

129
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,380
I broke my bones a lot,

130
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,530
and every time I got back on my feet, I got stronger.

131
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,400
Shinra said...

132
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,980
Recalling it is such a pain!

133
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,150
Anyway, I kept getting stronger.

134
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,900
However...

135
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,150
Hey...

136
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,590
Are you all right? You're always injured.

137
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,550
Wait a minute.

138
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,670
Here.

139
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,570
You need to drink milk to build stronger bones.

140
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,920
And one for you too.

141
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,160
Thank you.

142
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,780
I did it...

143
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,360
How do I say it...

144
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,200
When I realized what I did...

145
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,030
Good morning!
When I realized what I did...

146
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,760
What caused all this?

147
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,070
I was raised in a normal house.

148
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,550
I didn't have a traumatic childhood either.

149
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,300
So why?

150
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,550
Kasuka...

151
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:04,910
What?

152
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,550
Aren't you afraid of me?

153
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,560
Nope.

154
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,330
It was around then that I entered Raira Academy.

155
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,210
It's a grand-opening sale!

156
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,980
You'll receive a discount!

157
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,350
The shop is fresh. The fish is fresh!

158
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,790
It must be fate that we're attending the same school again.
The shop is fresh. The fish is fresh!

159
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,390
It must be fate that we're attending the same school again.

160
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,520
Zip it.

161
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,130
Well, how's your body?

162
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,720
Oh, I can give you a checkup to celebrate our reunion.

163
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,430
No?

164
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,640
Then how about a blood sample?

165
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,360
Selty!

166
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,240
What happened last night?

167
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,800
I was worried sick when you didn't show up.

168
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,540
Were you searching for your head again?

169
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:05,950
Yeah, right! That's just an excuse. You were having fun with a man—

170
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,260
Selty...

171
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,500
Stop jabbing my solar plexus!

172
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:13,890
I had a strange feeling.

173
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,000
Let me introduce him.
I had a strange feeling.

174
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,010
He's my friend, Heiwajima Shizuo-kun.
Let me introduce him.

175
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:15,940
He's my friend, Heiwajima Shizuo-kun.

176
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,130
I don't know how to put it...
He's my friend, Heiwajima Shizuo-kun.

177
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,980
Shizuo-kun, Selty is living with me.

178
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,980
Just...
And she's my future—

179
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,880
And she's my future—

180
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,040
I just remembered something annoying.

181
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,450
Oh, right...

182
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:33,890
That was when that flea bastard showed up.

183
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,820
Him...

184
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,280
Orihara Izaya!

185
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,260
I hated that guy...

186
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,010
This is Orihara Izaya. We went to the same junior high.

187
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,370
Well, he really isn't a good person.
...from the moment I saw him.

188
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,590
He's more like a pretty bad person.

189
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,310
Ouch, Shinra.

190
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,250
No, I didn't mean it in a bad way.

191
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,640
I don't like you.

192
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,390
Huh?

193
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,440
What a pity.

194
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,530
I thought we'd be able to have some fun.

195
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,800
Shut up.

196
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,030
Don't be so cold, Shizuo-kun.

197
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,460
See?

198
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,960
Fun, ain't it?

199
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:52,470
The day we met, we had a death match.

200
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,850
There wasn't any reason for it.

201
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,330
I just didn't like him.

202
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,230
But...

203
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,310
Are you all right?

204
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,440
Don't worry, he's fine.

205
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,240
He's solidly built.

206
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,510
I-Is he really okay?

207
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,140
Yes.

208
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,120
Thank you.

209
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:15,960
Screw this.

210
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,380
I'm beat.

211
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,790
What a coincidence.

212
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,930
Izaya's here too.

213
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,430
Hey, why aren't you hurt?

214
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,100
I'll kill you!

215
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,470
Kill you! Kill you! Kill you! Kill you! Kill you!

216
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,780
And the next day, things got even more annoying.
I'll fucking kill you!

217
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,600
I'll fucking kill you!

218
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,870
Some random punks started a fight with me.

219
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,610
I didn't do anything at all.

220
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,530
I just wanted to live in peace!

221
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,570
Damn! Damn!

222
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,240
Fuck!

223
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,110
He's pissing me off!

224
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,570
Annoying! Damn annoying!

225
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,020
So annoying! So annoying! So annoying! So annoying!

226
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,840
So damn annoying...

227
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,590
I know...

228
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,060
Die!

229
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,250
It was Izaya.

230
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,590
That bastard was pulling the strings.

231
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,970
When I found out...

232
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,750
Izaya!

233
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,210
I should have killed him on the spot!

234
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,280
Damn!

235
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,870
After we graduated from Raira Academy...

236
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,980
Well? Does it look good on me?

237
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,230
That idiot was like this.

238
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,160
And that flea was doing business with the Yakuza.

239
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,740
Anyway, things were quiet for a while.

240
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,740
As for me...

241
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,630
It was like this.

242
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:33,680
Welcome.

243
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,320
Hey, did you see him?

244
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,010
No way!

245
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,680
It's that famous actor!

246
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,980
Hanejima Yuuhei!

247
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,560
Hey, Kasuka.

248
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,500
What's up?

249
00:16:59,090 --> 00:16:59,990
Bartender uniforms?

250
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,450
I think it'd be better if you didn't change jobs so often.

251
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:09,360
I bought enough to last you forever.

252
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,920
Thanks.

253
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,880
I'll do my best.

254
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:15,780
But...

255
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,390
Damn!

256
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,150
Izaya!

257
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,390
That fucking flea framed me.

258
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,260
He disappeared from Ikebukuro.

259
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,960
The police quickly discovered that I was innocent and released me.

260
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,180
But...

261
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,790
Sorry, I couldn't keep my promise.

262
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,900
Oh, Shizuo-chan.

263
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,520
Tom-san was my senior in junior high,

264
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,780
and asked me to help him to collect debts.

265
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,690
Well, I'm something like a bodyguard.

266
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,670
At first I wasn't really that impressed with the job.

267
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,810
But Tom-san...

268
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,730
You don't have to resort to force for everything.

269
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,980
No one in Ikebukuro will fight back after hearing the name "Heiwajima Shizuo."

270
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,420
Well, that's how he convinced me, but...

271
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:21,860
Kasuka had been pretty busy with his job,

272
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,990
and I hadn't seen him in a while.

273
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,340
I wondered if he was mad at me.

274
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,460
What's all this then?

275
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,300
Yuuhei!

276
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,820
Yuuhei-san, it's your turn.

277
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,070
I don't know why,

278
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,720
but I felt better.

279
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,620
And so...

280
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,040
I've been working with Tom-san all this time.

281
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,360
It's time to repay?

282
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,990
I don't understand all this complicated stuff.

283
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,190
We're NEETs.

284
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:13,860
Aye.

285
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,510
It's the fault of society, school, and everyone else.

286
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,560
The ugly side of the human heart!

287
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,410
Listen.

288
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,220
I told you I don't know anything.

289
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,490
Buzz off, geezer.

290
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,640
That "geezer" has a job to do.

291
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,810
Huh? What's with that look?

292
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,720
H-Hey!

293
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,920
What's up with those clothes?

294
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,240
He's a butler, you idiot!

295
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,760
You guys haven't heard about Shizuo?

296
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,740
Who's that?

297
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,280
A celebrity?

298
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,860
Are you, Mr. Butt-ler? {deliberately with double t}

299
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,110
Crap!

300
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,960
Fill my glass please, okay, Mr. Butt-ler?

301
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,870
You really are NEETs if you're in Ikebukuro and you haven't heard about Shizuo.

302
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,880
My clothes...

303
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,880
The clothes I got from my brother...

304
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,800
I still dislike violence.

305
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,900
I want to become even stronger.

306
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,920
Strong enough to suppress my wrath.

307
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,920
I don't know why, but I feel much better after talking to you.

308
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,290
Glad to hear that.

309
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:35,610
Lately, I've been really pissed for some reason.

310
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,720
Yeah.

311
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,190
I came here because I heard a rumor about that.

312
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,240
I see.

313
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,050
Sorry about that.

314
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,580
Oh hush.

315
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,440
Bye.

316
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,190
I want to keep people at a distance,

317
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,540
but I can't be left alone.

318
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,850
That's why I try to stay in touch with other people,

319
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,560
like Tom-san and Kasuka.

320
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,470
The two of us are alike.

321
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,040
I'm sure...

322
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,110
Hey.

323
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,310
Shizuo.

324
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,480
Hey.

325
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,110
Are you out of puberty?

326
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,270
Then eat some sushi.

327
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,980
It's good. It's yummy.

328
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,750
Next time.

329
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,850
Izaya!

330
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:16,780
I see...

331
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,310
I knew something stunk!

332
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,310
So it was you!

333
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,070
What's he up to?

334
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,570
What's he doing in the city this time?!

335
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,290
Damn!

336
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:44,750
Izaya!

337
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,890
I dream.

338
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,140
I have the same dream again and again.

339
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:26,480
I wonder if I'm asleep while my head is awake, and vice versa?

340
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,140
Next time: Transient Dream.
