1
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,380
What's this urban legend?!

2
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,750
The black bike, dude!

3
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:11,750
The Headless Rider!

4
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,260
You know, the guy who rides that black bike doesn't...

5
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,380
have a head.

6
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,140
He moves just fine despite being decapitated.

7
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,350
Well, it's not really a hard job.

8
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,140
Either way, be careful.

9
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,060
I didn't know you became a Champion of Justice.

10
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,730
What the fuck?

11
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,610
What the fuck?!

12
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,970
The Headless Rider?

13
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,310
Yeah, I've heard of it!

14
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,190
My friend saw it. {saw it passing through the roads or somethign}

15
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,050
Dunno.

16
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,610
I'm really not that interested.

17
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,440
I even took a picture of it.

18
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,440
See?

19
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,700
The Headless Rider?

20
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,060
It's him!

21
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,180
You've heard of it, right?

22
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,960
I think I saw it around the Sunshine building.

23
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,200
Are you serious?

24
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,840
Not sure. Everyone was going "wow," so I guess it was there.

25
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,370
People love to gossip.

26
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,260
Looks like that rumored bike appeared again.

27
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,680
Is it really true that the rider doesn't have a head though?

28
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,140
It's just a silly rumor.

29
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,350
But I've heard quite a few rumors that it's real.

30
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,980
Oh?

31
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,270
Dude, not having a head is impossible.

32
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,080
But if it's not human...

33
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,150
then it's possible.

34
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,820
I heard that people involved with it won't talk about it.

35
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,510
I'm sorry. I don't know anything.

36
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,120
What about you?

37
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,630
What impression do you have of that legendary headless rider?

38
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,910
Scary? Cool?

39
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,630
Or maybe a pretty nice person?

40
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,160
No, rather...

41
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,630
Unsure on what to say?

42
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,150
Today, I'll tell you what I know about the Headless Rider.

43
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,520
I'll be painfully meticulous,

44
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,140
but please listen with an open mind.

45
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,610
Well, let me start by introducing myself.

46
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,800
My name is Kishitani Shinra. I'm twenty-four years old.

47
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,020
I work as an unlicensed doctor.

48
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,240
In other words, I'm an underground doctor who is summoned for various reasons.

49
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,960
I treat people wounded by illegal weapons,

50
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,460
or perform plastic surgery on people who need a new face.

51
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,550
Even if I don't look like it, I'm a pretty skilled and trusted physician.

52
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,090
Well then, let's move on to the main topic.

53
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,100
I'm back!

54
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,070
Right.

55
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,420
I'm living with the Headless Rider,

56
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,470
Selty Sturluson.

57
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,200
I'm back, Selty.

58
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,750
My job was fairly easy this time.

59
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,500
How about you?

60
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,500
Don't peek!

61
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,520
Sorry!

62
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,240
I didn't mean to peek.

63
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,540
Sorry, I was careless.

64
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,680
You seem kind of angry.

65
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,940
Maybe you need some calcium.

66
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,690
Are you telling me to eat eggshells or something?

67
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,610
Actually, that's not a bad idea.

68
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,170
Well, I'm not really interested in dietetics,

69
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,560
so I have no idea how much calcium is in an eggshell,

70
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,760
or how well the body can metabolize it.

71
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,690
Then again, it's also a question of how necessary calcium is,

72
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,920
since we don't even know where your brain is.

73
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,300
Shut up!

74
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,940
Say, Selty... I know I'm being a nag, but...

75
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,560
How does the world look to you, someone without eyes?

76
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,570
I can't tell you something I don't understand myself.

77
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,240
She doesn't have a head,

78
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,840
but she has sight, she can hear, and she can smell.

79
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,130
But it's not like she can see in every direction at once just because she doesn't have a head.

80
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,710
It's just that her field of vision is slightly wider than a normal human's.

81
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,970
This is just my hypothesis,

82
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:13,050
but maybe that strange, sci-fi substance emanating from your body

83
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,710
emits particles that collect information about whatever they touch,

84
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,430
and then relay that information back to you.

85
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,480
Obviously, objects that are too far away will be blurry.

86
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,320
I don't care.

87
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,490
As long as I can see and hear, I don't care about any of that.

88
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,990
You're always like that, Selty.

89
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:40,290
I just want to know how different my world

90
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,320
is from yours.

91
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,310
I'm not just talking about sight.

92
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,590
It's also a matter of values.

93
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,960
Not your values as a human,

94
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,510
but as a fairie that has been incarnated in this city.

95
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,650
I'm interested in the values you have about this world as a Dullahan.

96
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,800
What's wrong?

97
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:21,030
If you want, you can tell me what happened.

98
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,520
Orihara-kun said your job was pretty easy.

99
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,800
I got the job done pretty quickly.

100
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:36,850
But?

101
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,470
Big props to the transporter.

102
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,940
Things work well for me because you're here for me, and vice versa.

103
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,620
I disagree with the latter.

104
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,200
Oh, don't be so cold.

105
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,640
I'll be asking for your help again.

106
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,580
I want to get along with you.

107
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,580
For a very long time...

108
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,050
Is it just me, or do you creep people out?

109
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,050
Not at all. It's just your imagination.

110
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,600
By the way, have you heard of the Dullahan?

111
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,940
It's a headless fairie from Ireland.

112
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:24,300
An elderly portraitist over at Yoyogi Park says he saw one a long time ago.

113
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:29,900
I heard he made a big fuss about how it didn't have a head.

114
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,610
I wonder if he meant the Dullahan's head?

115
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,490
Is he still there?

116
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,780
I don't really know.

117
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,790
Oh, so you <i>are</i> curious about it.

118
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,100
Selty Sturluson isn't human.

119
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,640
She's what's known as a "Dullahan." It's something like a fairie in Celtic mythology.

120
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,650
Do you know of a portraitist around here?

121
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,540
Oh, he left already.

122
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:20,250
Hey, didn't he say he was going to Yokohama or something?

123
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,740
A Dullahan carries its decapitated head under its arm

124
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,310
and rides a coiste bodhar, a two-wheeled coach that's pulled by a headless horse.

125
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,640
It visits the homes of those due to die.

126
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,980
If you carelessly open the door,

127
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,520
it'll throw a basin of blood on you.

128
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:06,610
It's not that easy to relate her to a sinister legend about a bringer of death.

129
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,830
Except that neither has a head.

130
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:15,800
So why did she come to Japan, to Tokyo, and specifically, to Ikebukuro?

131
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,010
And why does she worry so much about her head?

132
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,890
I'll explain that now.

133
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,840
It happened twenty years ago.

134
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,320
She suddenly woke up in the mountains

135
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,750
and noticed that her head was missing.

136
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:44,330
Then, she realized that many of her memories were gone.

137
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,500
She'd forgotten why she did what she did,

138
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,360
and she'd forgotten other memories to a certain degree.

139
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,350
However, she didn't forget that she was a Dullahan,

140
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,250
that her name was Selty Sturluson,

141
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,380
or how to use her abilities.

142
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,350
What shocked her was...

143
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,540
I've never used my head to think.

144
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,040
That.

145
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,860
Furthermore, she realized that she could sense her head's presence.

146
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,790
After considering her situation, she concluded

147
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:36,440
that her will had originally been shared between her body and head,

148
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,380
and that her memories must have remained in her head.

149
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,220
So she decided

150
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,450
to reclaim her head, for it held her raison d'être.

151
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,390
From then on, that became her reason for living.

152
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:56,890
Perhaps her head had separated itself from her body on its own.

153
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:01,150
Regardless, she could determine this only by finding her head.

154
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,660
He wasn't in Yokohama any more.

155
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,910
So I went to Tama and Chiba.

156
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,570
I always just missed him.

157
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,070
You should have waited until the next day.

158
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,750
I was desperate.

159
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,810
My head might have been there.

160
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,810
I desperately wanted it back.

161
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,800
As soon as possible.

162
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,040
I don't want to live with a hazy memory.

163
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:37,560
Even though she could sense her head's presence,

164
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,110
she only learned that her head was heading overseas through investigative work.

165
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,300
The ship's destination was Japan.

166
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,230
Smuggling herself aboard would be simple,

167
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,880
but her horse would be a problem.

168
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,730
A Dullahan's horse is something like a familiar that possesses the body of a dead horse.

169
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,270
If she'd wanted, she could have gotten rid of it.

170
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,970
But where would it go then?

171
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,880
The answer probably lays within her head.

172
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,000
All these thoughts made her anxious and unable to move forward.

173
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,470
And then...

174
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,360
She...

175
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,820
spotted that.

176
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,970
In the end I couldn't find it.

177
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,460
However...

178
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,720
Oh, I know that portraitist.

179
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,400
He came to South Ikebukuro Park two days ago.

180
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,580
Yeah.

181
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,880
Want me to come along?

182
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,890
Talking to him would be inconvenient, right?

183
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,770
There you go.

184
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,440
Wow, nice!

185
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,780
You're prettier in that picture than in real life.

186
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,590
Hey!

187
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,460
You're really good at this.

188
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:14,870
Well, there are still things I can't draw the way I want.

189
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,120
Thank you.

190
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,540
You're welcome.

191
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:19,910
Let's go.

192
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,830
Come back again.
Let's go.

193
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,960
We will!

194
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,680
Sorry, but it's getting dark.

195
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,530
I've called it a day.

196
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,940
Is it true that you saw a Dullahan?

197
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,360
Yeah, it is.

198
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,040
I saw it in the mountains of Ireland when I was young.

199
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,440
There's no mistake.

200
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,240
What do you mean by "lost its head"?

201
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,980
"Lost its head"?

202
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,010
That's not it.

203
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,740
It doesn't have a head.

204
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,450
A head just doesn't suit it.

205
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,040
Look.

206
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,070
It was a woman.

207
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,630
A very, very beautiful one.

208
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,520
I saw her on the mountain path on a foggy night.

209
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,250
She passed by at high speed.

210
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,940
She was horrifying, yet beautiful.

211
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:30,200
I felt that she wasn't from this world.

212
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,490
When I returned to the inn and asked around,

213
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,940
I was told she was a Dullahan.

214
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,880
Apparently, she's been living there for a long time.

215
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,500
Why isn't the Dullahan in your drawing carrying a head?

216
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,540
I just can't draw it.

217
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,120
The more I draw, the stranger it looks.

218
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:55,260
I remember that day as if it were yesterday, but I can't connect with that woman.

219
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,200
What color was her hair? And her eyes?

220
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,770
What kind of expression did she have?

221
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,520
If I could explain that, I wouldn't have tried to draw her.

222
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,500
Speaking of which, some strange man visited me.

223
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,380
He said that the picture was already perfect.

224
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,330
And that she didn't need a head.

225
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,480
What a weirdo.

226
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,430
Why are you so obsessed?

227
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:28,240
It was the most fascinating experience of my life.

228
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,700
That night was very unique to me.

229
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,210
I want to return to that moment, the recollections of that night.

230
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,770
Thanks, old man.

231
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,010
I see.

232
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,640
But you don't remember meeting him.

233
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,230
No.

234
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:00,540
Which means that the Dullahan might not have been you.

235
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,790
Or he was just mistaken.

236
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,950
It was me.

237
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,230
It had to be.

238
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,250
I see.

239
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,890
I wonder where I was headed?

240
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,180
What was I thinking? And why...

241
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,870
Do you really need to brood about it?

242
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:25,290
You're truly an elusive, novel person.

243
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:30,310
Fact is, your objective is far away from you.

244
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,140
Cut to the chase.

245
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,610
Very well.

246
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,280
Give up.

247
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,400
Perhaps that weird guy is right.

248
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,270
Maybe it's fine to not have a head.

249
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,080
Stop searching for your head.

250
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,700
Let's go somewhere.

251
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,090
Just the two of us.

252
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:01,910
If you wish, I can take you back to your homeland, regardless of the means.

253
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,830
I'll come with you too.

254
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,200
And then we'll live there together—

255
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:12,360
I don't dislike you, but living like this is enough for me.

256
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,640
Oh, come on.

257
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,320
It's enough!

258
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,160
Then...

259
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,810
Be a little more femin—

260
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,050
It's enough!

261
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:36,060
So is there a difference between my values and hers?

262
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,800
Anyway, back to the story.

263
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,150
What happened after she boarded the ship.

264
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:43,510
No...

265
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,100
Our story.

266
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,970
She managed to persuade the sailor to smuggle her onto the ship,

267
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,610
but she noticed how much she stood out.

268
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,370
It's not that big a deal now that I've known her for a while.

269
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,970
The first time I saw that, I was completely in awe.

270
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,790
Back then, I was four years old.

271
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,750
I was returning to Japan with my father.

272
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,240
Dad! There's a woman in the hatch!
I was returning to Japan with my father.

273
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,260
My father, Shingen, was a bit abnormal.

274
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,050
Hurry up! Dad!
My father, Shingen, was a bit abnormal.

275
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,840
I believe the normal reaction would be to laugh at your silly kid.

276
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,580
But my father was different.

277
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,080
I wonder if it was his nature as a doctor,

278
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,830
but he suddenly became interested in my story.

279
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,370
Excuse me, miss.

280
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,320
Is it true that you don't have a head?

281
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,860
My father said,

282
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:45,370
"If you let me dissect you just once, I'll give you a place to stay."

283
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,120
She accepted his offer.

284
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,190
I'm sure both the benefits and anxiety were on her mind.

285
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,580
She doesn't really remember what happened.

286
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,470
The anesthetic given to humans didn't really work.

287
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,770
I believe the shock was too much for her.

288
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,480
She feels pain, but it is far less than what a human feels.

289
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,770
She doesn't have a heart.

290
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:22,210
Her organs don't work. They are merely there.

291
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,410
She has veins, yet blood doesn't flow through them.

292
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,490
She is merely flesh.

293
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,410
She's like a living anatomical model.

294
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,410
But look at this.

295
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,250
How is it possible for her to die?

296
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,220
I have a horrible father, don't I?

297
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,430
He told his four-year-old son to dissect her.

298
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:50,470
But thanks to him, I've learned the skills necessary to become a doctor.

299
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,810
Though I don't know if I should be happy about this.

300
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:54,930
What's the matter?

301
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:02,420
I've been attracted to her ever since I saw her.

302
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:07,500
My feelings haven't changed a bit in the twenty years I've lived with her.

303
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:13,500
She's been searching for her head all this time while working as a transporter.

304
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:18,080
I wonder what she's going to do when she finds her head.

305
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,500
What will happen to her?

306
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:24,650
Does her will come from her head?

307
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,050
Or is it...

308
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,250
What are you filming?

309
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,680
Uh... How should I say it?

310
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,470
I wanted to leave a piece of our sweet daily life for future generations.

311
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,740
I don't really care. Just pipe down a bit.

312
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,980
I can't sleep.

313
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,670
Sorry, Selty.

314
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,780
Well, that's it for now.

315
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,940
I'll continue another time.

316
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,030
Wow!

317
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,910
This is perfect!

318
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,600
What part of this is perfect?

319
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,560
In truth, Dullahan carry their heads.

320
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,520
Perhaps they don't need a head.

321
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,980
That's absurd.

322
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,990
You only say that because you haven't seen one in person.

323
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,930
It was a beautiful woman.

324
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,060
Yes.

325
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:17,030
But I like her better without a head.

326
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,060
She's more charming that way.

327
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,710
The drawing is perfect.

328
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:23,860
You don't need to worry.

329
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,680
It's okay if you can't draw it.

330
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,190
Let it be like this.

331
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,150
I'm still going to draw it.

332
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,000
It's fine like that!

333
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,590
You're quite the weirdo, aren't you?

334
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,970
Please, I'm not that weird!

335
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:19,090
You wanna know about my love-love-get-a-kiss and heart-breaking life?

336
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:24,360
Then tune your heart to my, Kida Masaomi's, shy and cool channel.

337
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,150
Next time: Weeping Wine and Selling Vinegar.

338
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:30,380
Don't miss the chance of your lifetime!
