Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.61,0:03:41.61,Drrr Thoughts,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}Well, let me start by introducing myself.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.61,0:03:44.80,Drrr Thoughts,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}My name is Kishitani Shinra. I'm twenty-four years old.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.80,0:03:47.02,Drrr Thoughts,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}I work as an unlicensed doctor.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.02,0:03:49.24,Drrr Thoughts,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}In other words, I'm an underground doctor who is summoned for various reasons.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.97,0:03:53.96,Drrr Thoughts,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}I treat people wounded by illegal weapons,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.35,0:03:57.46,Drrr Thoughts,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}or perform plastic surgery on people who need a new face.

Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.17,0:04:37.50,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}How about you?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.86,0:04:38.50,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}Don't peek!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.17,0:04:40.52,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}Sorry!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.52,0:04:42.24,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}I didn't mean to peek.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.24,0:04:43.54,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}Sorry, I was careless.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.90,0:04:51.68,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}You seem kind of angry.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.48,0:04:54.94,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}Maybe you need some calcium.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.23,0:04:58.69,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}Are you telling me to eat eggshells or something?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.05,0:05:03.61,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}Actually, that's not a bad idea.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.61,0:05:07.17,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}Well, I'm not really interested in dietetics,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.17,0:05:10.56,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}so I have no idea how much calcium is in an eggshell,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.56,0:05:14.76,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}or how well the body can metabolize it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.97,0:05:19.69,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}Then again, it's also a question of how necessary calcium is,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.69,0:05:22.92,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}since we don't even know where your brain is.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.69,0:05:25.30,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}Shut up!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.80,0:05:34.94,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}Say, Selty... I know I'm being a nag, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.94,0:05:39.56,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}How does the world look to you, someone without eyes?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.20,0:05:47.57,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}I can't tell you something I don't understand myself.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.35,0:05:51.24,Drrr Thoughts,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}She doesn't have a head,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.24,0:05:54.84,Drrr Thoughts,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}but she has sight, she can hear, and she can smell.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.84,0:05:59.13,Drrr Thoughts,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}But it's not like she can see in every direction at once just because she doesn't have a head.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.13,0:06:02.71,Drrr Thoughts,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}It's just that her field of vision is slightly wider than a normal human's.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.31,0:06:06.97,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}This is just my hypothesis,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.97,0:06:13.05,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}but maybe that strange, sci-fi substance emanating from your body
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.05,0:06:17.71,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}emits particles that collect information about whatever they touch,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.71,0:06:20.43,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}and then relay that information back to you.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.69,0:06:25.48,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}Obviously, objects that are too far away will be blurry.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.05,0:06:29.32,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}I don't care.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.32,0:06:31.49,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}As long as I can see and hear, I don't care about any of that.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.49,0:06:34.99,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}You're always like that, Selty.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.99,0:06:40.29,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}I just want to know how different my world
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.34,0:06:44.32,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}is from yours.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.32,0:06:46.31,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}I'm not just talking about sight.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.31,0:06:48.59,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}It's also a matter of values.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.59,0:06:50.96,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}Not your values as a human,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.96,0:06:54.51,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}but as a fairie that has been incarnated in this city.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.02,0:07:00.65,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}I'm interested in the values you have about this world as a Dullahan.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.65,0:07:16.80,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}What's wrong?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.71,0:07:21.03,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}If you want, you can tell me what happened.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.30,0:07:30.52,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}Orihara-kun said your job was pretty easy.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:31.32,0:07:34.80,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}I got the job done pretty quickly.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.38,0:07:36.85,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}But?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.63,0:07:44.47,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}Big props to the transporter.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.47,0:07:47.94,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}Things work well for me because you're here for me, and vice versa.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.94,0:07:50.62,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}I disagree with the latter.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.62,0:07:52.20,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}Oh, don't be so cold.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.62,0:07:54.64,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}I'll be asking for your help again.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.64,0:07:57.58,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}I want to get along with you.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.58,0:07:59.58,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}For a very long time...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.63,0:08:08.05,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}Is it just me, or do you creep people out?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.05,0:08:11.05,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}Not at all. It's just your imagination.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.05,0:08:13.60,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}By the way, have you heard of the Dullahan?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.89,0:08:17.94,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}It's a headless fairie from Ireland.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.94,0:08:24.30,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}An elderly portraitist over at Yoyogi Park says he saw one a long time ago.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.15,0:08:29.90,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}I heard he made a big fuss about how it didn't have a head.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.90,0:08:33.61,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}I wonder if he meant the Dullahan's head?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.73,0:08:38.49,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}Is he still there?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:38.49,0:08:40.78,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}I don't really know.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:47.29,0:08:49.79,Drrr Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}Oh, so you {\i1}are{\i0} curious about it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.49,0:08:59.10,Drrr Thoughts,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}Selty Sturluson isn't human.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:59.92,0:09:05.64,Drrr Thoughts,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}She's what's known as a "Dullahan." It's something like a fairie in Celtic mythology.

Dialogue: 0,0:10:10.73,0:10:15.80,Drrr Thoughts,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}So why did she come to Japan, to Tokyo, and specifically, to Ikebukuro?

Dialogue: 0,0:11:27.37,0:11:31.79,Drrr Thoughts,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}After considering her situation, she concluded
Dialogue: 0,0:11:31.79,0:11:36.44,Drrr Thoughts,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}that her will had originally been shared between her body and head,

Dialogue: 0,0:11:51.39,0:11:56.89,Drrr Thoughts,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}Perhaps her head had separated itself from her body on its own.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:56.89,0:12:01.15,Drrr Thoughts,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}Regardless, she could determine this only by finding her head.

Dialogue: 0,0:12:47.23,0:12:48.88,Drrr Thoughts,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}but her horse would be a problem.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:50.11,0:12:54.73,Drrr Thoughts,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}A Dullahan's horse is something like a familiar that possesses the body of a dead horse.

Dialogue: 0,0:13:01.97,0:13:03.88,Drrr Thoughts,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}The answer probably lays within her head.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:04.86,0:13:09.00,Drrr Thoughts,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}All these thoughts made her anxious and unable to move forward.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:17.19,0:13:18.47,Drrr Thoughts,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}And then...

Dialogue: 0,0:13:26.11,0:13:27.82,Drrr Thoughts,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be1}spotted that.
