1
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,750
Why are you asking about them?

2
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,170
You aren't thinking about joining them, are you?

3
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,130
What the hell?!

4
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,550
And besides! Why the heck is my head on another body?!

5
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,740
Or maybe it's a fresh corpse.

6
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,830
This is gonna be fun!

7
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,890
So fun! So fun!

8
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,770
What do you think will happen to us if the cops see that thing?

9
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,370
I don't care if it's dead or alive.

10
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,780
If you have no other choice, destroy it on the spot.

11
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,570
Looks like I won't be able to afford any luxuries this month.{i didn't time the ugh on purpose}

12
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,970
Next, I need a kitchen sponge and...

13
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,980
Have a nice day.

14
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,020
It's the black bike!

15
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,180
It must be around the corner!

16
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,890
Ouch...

17
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,760
S-Sorry.

18
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,500
Are you okay?

19
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,860
You're...

20
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,260
Help me!

21
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,470
Please!

22
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,430
Whoa! It's the black bike!

23
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,840
Is this for real?

24
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,820
This is so cool!

25
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,380
Gotta take a pic!

26
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,540
This is unreal!

27
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,160
Oh? So you bumped into this beauty on the street,{3.36.04 start if you don't want the hohum at the start}

28
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,070
who was being chased by this evil girl on a bike,

29
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,230
has amnesia,

30
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,120
and had fallen asleep from fatigue by the time I got here.

31
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,850
Are you asking me to believe a story I'd only have in my wildest dreams?

32
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,050
Dude, I'm serious! Really!

33
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:54,350
However, if this had happened in the morning and made you late for school, it'd be stereotypical. {try keeping that archetype and stereotype in next line for the pun explained later OR (preferably) find something better}

34
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,860
Oh, and if she'd been a transfer student, it'd be archetypical!

35
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,450
And if she'd been the princess of a kingdom, and in truth, your childhood friend, it'd be perfect.

36
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,100
Did you get my "stereotypical" and "archetypical" pun?

37
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,030
You know, you ruined it by explaining it.

38
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,390
I don't know what to do. She lost her memories,

39
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,320
but she doesn't want to go to the police.

40
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,040
Uh... Well, let's wait and see how things turn out.

41
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,730
For now, let's wait till tomorrow,

42
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,090
and we'll decide what to do after hearing her out.

43
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,310
Yeah.

44
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,080
Anyway, catch you tomorrow.

45
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,310
Good night.

46
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,950
The girl on the black bike might remember my face.

47
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,170
That black bike, considered to be an urban legend...

48
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,010
What can I do against her now that she's my enemy?

49
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,430
I hated my easygoing life.

50
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,770
I wanted a different life.

51
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,530
Maybe that's why I brought her here.

52
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,030
But there's something Kida-kun doesn't know about:

53
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,260
her scar.

54
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,490
It's as if someone decapitated her and then forcefully sewed her head back on.

55
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,750
This is an announcement from the cafeteria.

56
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,090
The jumbo melon breads have sold out today.

57
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,680
'Sup, Mikado!

58
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,220
What happened to that sleeping beauty in your run-down apartment?

59
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,350
Keep it down, Kida-kun!

60
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,210
Oh? A beauty?

61
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,710
That word doesn't go unnoticed by me.
Oh? A beauty?

62
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,760
That word doesn't go unnoticed by me.

63
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,320
You know...

64
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,730
When Mikado rounded the corner,

65
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,330
he bumped into a babe who was being chased by a baddie.

66
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,540
And now, he's living together with her.

67
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,470
Oh... It's just Mr. A/C's fantasy.

68
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,240
It's Ryuugamine, not "Mr. A/C."

69
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,240
See?

70
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,280
Anyone want to buy me meal tickets?

71
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,580
There's no need to worry. No one will believe you!

72
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,770
So, how's the chick doing?

73
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,000
She was still sleeping when I left.

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,160
Guess she's really tired.

75
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,390
Anyway, let's get down to business.

76
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,290
Business?

77
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:10,780
The reason why I ate lunch early, in fourth period, is because I'm trying to use my lunch break effectively.

78
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,600
Dollars Probability Predictions...

79
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,110
This is all the rage in our class right now.

80
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,260
The whole Dollars story is veiled in mystery.

81
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,020
So at school, we go,

82
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,580
"Doesn't that guy look like one of the Dollars?"

83
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,350
and vote on it.

84
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,110
Looks like you guys have a lot of votes.

85
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,920
Well, each person can vote for several people.

86
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:38,050
This Takiguchi guy from Class 1-D only has one vote.

87
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,500
Oh, you noticed.

88
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,140
I, Lord Kida Masaomi, hath given him that vote.

89
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,170
I'm actually in the same P.E. class as him.

90
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:51,100
I'm strongly convinced that Takiguchi Ryou is a member of the Dollars.

91
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,240
What makes you think that?

92
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,100
Instinct.

93
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,510
So, I'm gonna go check him out.

94
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,270
Hey!

95
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,540
'Scuze me!

96
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,870
Is Takiguchi Ryou-kun here?

97
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,340
He's not here.

98
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,600
Is he in the cafeteria?

99
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,500
Dunno. Maybe the roof?

100
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,660
I think he usually goes up there during lunch.

101
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,620
Maybe he's having a smoke break.

102
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,980
Shouldn't we... not do this?

103
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,040
There might be scary people up there.

104
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,900
I'm just kidding, dude.

105
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,930
Smoking on the rooftop during lunch is only in those ancient, clichéd comics.

106
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,740
But if you just ask him if he's a member of the Dollars,

107
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,270
I doubt he'll honestly say, "Yes, I am."

108
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,150
Dude, leave it to me.

109
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,550
I have a plan.

110
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,170
Let's see.

111
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,810
H-He's smoking.

112
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,840
Hey, Takiguchi!

113
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,910
'Sup.

114
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,630
Oh, you compose songs?

115
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,240
Well, yeah.

116
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,990
What's up?

117
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,190
Need something?

118
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,640
There's something I want to ask you.

119
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,840
Go ahead.

120
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,080
Are you a member of the Dollars?

121
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,830
Kida-kun...

122
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,750
Yes, I am.

123
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,630
I knew it.

124
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,600
I was absolutely sure.

125
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,530
See?

126
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,760
I've got great instincts!

127
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,690
This is my childhood friend.

128
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,560
I'm Ryuugamine Mikado.

129
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,640
So you're that famous guy.

130
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,300
Me? Famous?

131
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,310
Your name.

132
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,870
Want some?

133
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,440
Thanks.

134
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,030
Thanks.

135
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,700
Uh, Takiguchi-kun...

136
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,380
Why did you join the Dollars?

137
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,790
Hm... Now that you ask me out of nowhere...

138
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,660
I think it was six months ago.

139
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,560
Some stranger invited me via a text message.

140
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,090
He said that they didn't have any rules or restrictions.

141
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,300
At first I was like, "No way,"

142
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,320
but then I thought it'd be pretty fun if it were true.

143
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,730
You know...

144
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,230
I don't like to order or be ordered around.

145
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,150
So, what kind of group are they?

146
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,520
Well, you could say they're colorless.

147
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,120
Colorless?

148
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,920
Yup.

149
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,350
Unlike the Yellow Napkins and Blue Squares, they don't wear the same color

150
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,370
or try to expand their influence.

151
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,580
Blue Squares?

152
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,650
They're a color gang that was pretty well known when I was in junior high.

153
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,600
I don't really know much about them,

154
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,460
but they disbanded after causing some incident.

155
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,470
Kida-kun?

156
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,990
So you like them, right?

157
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,990
Yep.

158
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,890
Have you met the other members?

159
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:49,470
Well, not really. You just know their nicknames,

160
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,390
but I've met quite a few of them.

161
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,540
Sometimes at work, or bumping into them on the street.

162
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,880
They were all coincidental though.

163
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,410
Well, if you think a person is a member, it's usually true.

164
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,160
What do you mean?

165
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,160
Well there's no tell-tale sign.

166
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,800
Just ask around like you asked me.

167
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,730
Most of them will tell you.

168
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,700
Crap.

169
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,130
See ya!

170
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,760
Ever since I found out that Takiguchi-kun was really part of the Dollars,

171
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,530
I decided to keep it to myself.

172
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,220
I'm sure he wouldn't like it if other people made a fuss about it.

173
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,390
Okay, take your seats.

174
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,180
I think only those who ask should know.
Okay, take your seats.

175
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:28,850
I think only those who ask should know.

176
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,860
Rise.

177
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,040
Bow.

178
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,200
That concludes the representative meeting.

179
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,780
I wonder if the disciplinary staff that Kida-kun's a part of is still meeting.

180
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,080
They should be finishing up soon.

181
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,270
Hey, wait!

182
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,540
Harima Mika-san, who was stalking Yagiri Seiji-kun,

183
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,300
has been missing since the first day of school.

184
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,370
Have you learned anything new about Harima-san yet?

185
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,250
No, nothing.

186
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,780
Ryuugamine!

187
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,450
Kida said you should go home first.

188
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,980
Why? Did something happen?

189
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:16,190
Looks like he's busy debating at the disciplinary staff meeting.

190
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,530
See ya.

191
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,630
Uh...

192
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,660
Shall we go then?

193
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,110
Okay.

194
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,290
I wonder what he's debating about.

195
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,890
Maybe about uniforms and hair styles?

196
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:34,880
Mikado!
Maybe about uniforms and hair styles?

197
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,000
Mikado!

198
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,330
The princess' commands are absolute, got it?

199
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:44,260
Also, make sure to introduce me to her next time! See ya!

200
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:52,420
"Princess" is the name of a French person I met at Russia Sushi.

201
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,520
Uh...

202
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,180
S-She has a piercing on her nose...

203
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:01,240
Uh, so he's gotta be arguing about that.

204
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:08,150
I've known you for a long time.

205
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,010
When I was turning in my entry registration,

206
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:14,890
the information desk had a list where you could look for your name.

207
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,630
I saw yours and thought, "That's a pretty cool name,"

208
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,590
and then you happened to be in my class.

209
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,930
Then I thought it'd be nice to be a class representative with you.

210
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,320
Hey, hold on a second.
Then I thought it'd be nice to be a class representative with you.

211
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,600
Then I thought it'd be nice to be a class representative with you.

212
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,620
Isn't this like what happened with Harima Mika-san and Yagiri Seiji-kun?

213
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,330
Shit, stalkers are dangerous.

214
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:34,690
Well, if it's a cutie like her it's okay... Or not.

215
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,570
No way, no way.

216
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,980
If I screw up...

217
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,620
s-she'll stab me to death!

218
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,950
N-No, maybe she'll be a pyromaniac and burn my place down.

219
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,990
Wait, what if she takes my family hostage?

220
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,870
But if she has a good personality, being a stalker shouldn't be a...

221
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,670
No, no, no.

222
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,840
The fact that she's a stalker means she doesn't have a good personality!

223
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,630
I was just kidding.

224
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,710
I'd just be a nuisance to you.

225
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,510
No, that's not true.

226
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,720
Please don't worry. I'm not a stalker.

227
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,140
No, I didn't think that.

228
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,970
Sorry.

229
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,480
Don't be. I was just teasing you.

230
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,150
Please don't apologize.

231
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,530
Uh...
Um.

232
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,150
Then...

233
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,400
Let's continue our good relationship.

234
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,580
Yes, of course.

235
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,060
Takeshi, it's him!

236
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,870
Who? Not me, right?

237
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,820
I'm talking about you, damn it!

238
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,550
Stop acting so innocent!

239
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,070
Um... Who are you?

240
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:08,400
Thanks to your friend, I had to buy a new cellphone!

241
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,540
Uh... I'm not sure I'm following you...

242
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:24,300
So you're the pal of the guy who broke my girlfriend's cellphone, eh?

243
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,590
We aren't really friends...

244
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,900
Then who is he? Your dad?

245
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,850
Your co-signer?

246
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:32,050
Huh? I can't hear you!

247
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,260
That reasoning is a little off...
Huh? I can't hear you!

248
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,180
Huh? I can't hear you!

249
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,310
You trying to hold a sermon or what, you little asshat?

250
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:42,300
I'll teach you about social hierarchy, you little dipshit!

251
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,330
You brought him here because I don't hit girls.

252
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,790
Aw, how considerate of you.

253
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:06,340
I'd love to make you my girlfriend, but I'm afraid you're not my type.

254
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,920
Buzz off!

255
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,800
You jerk!

256
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,070
Bye!

257
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,280
Well then, Ryuugamine Mikado-kun.

258
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,230
I was waiting for you near the school gate because I wanted to see you.

259
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,860
I wanted to talk you about something.

260
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,360
By the way, why is the black bike here?

261
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,830
She must be looking for that girl.

262
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,310
Ah, darn! I completely forgot!

263
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:41,310
I'm in a rush.

264
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,690
Good-bye, Sonohara-san.

265
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,570
This is way too surreal.

266
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:01,430
At this rate, they're going to follow me back to my place.

267
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,440
And then...

268
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,150
Help me!

269
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,340
U-Um...

270
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,010
Uh...

271
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,780
I-I will hear you out here.

272
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,230
I can wait till the black bike's finished her business.

273
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,340
Hello?

274
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,440
Ah, nice to hear from you again.

275
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,880
T-There's something I'd like to ask.

276
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,720
What is it?

277
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,050
So she can communicate.

278
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,060
Who are you?

279
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:51,690
I'm looking for my relative's missing daughter.

280
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:55,150
I found her yesterday, but for some reason, she ran away.

281
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,740
S-She's a terrible liar.

282
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:01,490
I'm afraid I don't believe you.

283
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,530
How much do you know about me?

284
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,970
Uh... You're an urban legend...

285
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:15,510
and you ride a bike without an engine or headlights.

286
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,890
And...

287
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,640
You don't have a head.

288
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,700
Do you believe that?

289
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,880
Um... Could you show me...

290
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,900
what's behind that helmet?

291
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,840
I never imagined I'd have the guts to say that.

292
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,090
Just don't start screaming.
I never imagined I'd have the guts to say that.

293
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,180
Just don't start screaming.

294
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:46,820
But I had the feeling that I'd been waiting for this moment all my life.

295
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:52,920
I still don't know how to describe what I felt.

296
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:57,970
I was repeating, "I knew it! I knew it!"

297
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,430
deep in my mind.

298
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,330
Thank you very much.

299
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:12,860
After that, she told me the real reason she was chasing that girl.

300
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,110
She told me that her name was Selty, and that she was a Dullahan.

301
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,380
About how she came all the way to Japan to look for her missing head.

302
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,600
And the girl with a scar around her neck had a head that looked just like it.

303
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:27,900
Usually, no one would believe a word of that.

304
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,600
But for some reason, I believed her.

305
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,530
Are you her friend?

306
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,140
No, I just met her yesterday.

307
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,970
I asked her about what happened,

308
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,830
and she said she lost her memories.

309
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,260
Selty-san?

310
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,430
Can I meet her?

311
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:57,780
I think she's scared of you because you started chasing her so suddenly.

312
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,910
I want to see her!

313
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,300
Can't we clear up that misunderstanding?

314
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,120
Okay.

315
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,380
Nothing beats a milkshake with fruit!

316
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:24,710
I'm convinced that this development is a sign that Shocker will become the heroine! {Misaka Mikoto from To Aru}

317
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:28,560
No! This decides Himegami as the heroine!

318
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:40,800
What the fuck?!{check timing please}

319
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,530
Hey!
What the fuck?!{check timing please}

320
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,780
What the hell are you doing?!

321
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,250
That motherfucker...

322
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,600
He scratched my car!

323
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,790
Chill out, Togusa!

324
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,760
That motherfucker is dead!
Chill out, Togusa!

325
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,920
That motherfucker is dead!

326
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,670
The light turned red!

327
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,430
Please wait here for a moment.

328
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,600
I'll explain the situation to her.

329
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:12,850
I don't want her to see you and think that I'm betraying her.

330
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,760
Okay.

331
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,150
He's pretty cautious.

332
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,640
Huh?

333
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,920
This is the first time I've heard your name.

334
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,340
I didn't expect you to be a foreigner.

335
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,190
Bullshit.

336
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,670
The next time you throw a rock at my horse, you'll be in trouble.

337
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,970
So that's a horse.

338
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:52,560
By the way, don't you think he's taking too long?

339
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,850
Would a cleaning service visit an apartment as run-down as this?

340
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,650
No way!

341
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:08,620
Like I said, I just want to know where that girl is.

342
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,800
This strand of hair on the floor is hers, isn't it?

343
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,470
I really don't know.

344
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,750
P-Please let me go...

345
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,010
You've already seen our faces.

346
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,580
We have to dispose of you here.

347
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,050
Hey, someone's coming!

348
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,600
I'm saved!

349
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,010
You don't have to chase them.

350
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,110
I know where they're headed.

351
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,320
I recognize that van.

352
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,150
I believe it's from Yagiri Pharmaceuticals.

353
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:47,040
Yagiri Pharmaceuticals?

354
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,980
Yes.

355
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,740
Lately their profits have been plummeting, and they're about to be absorbed by a foreign company.

356
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,200
The girl with a scar that went missing...

357
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,040
A Dullahan...

358
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,210
People going missing...

359
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,540
Harima Mika...

360
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,750
Yagiri Seiji...

361
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,840
Human trafficking...

362
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,930
And... the Dollars...

363
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,770
What's he doing?

364
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,570
I hated an easygoing life.

365
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:25,380
To be honest, I wasn't really sure...

366
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,410
Please, help me a little.

367
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,730
I wanted a different life.

368
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:39,960
I've gathered all the pieces. {chess pieces}

369
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,390
That's why...

370
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,420
Bullseye!

371
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,920
I will...

372
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,290
I hated an easygoing life.

373
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,890
I wanted a different life.

374
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:25,480
I didn't expect my little wish to affect so many people.

375
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,100
Next time: Storm and Stress.
