1
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,830
Dollars?

2
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't know much about them either,

3
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,510
but they have lots of crazy members. A shitload of 'em.

4
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,390
You can't skip school on the first day.

5
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,680
Leave me alone!

6
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,510
Anyway, don't go near Heiwajima Shizuo.

7
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,060
Orihara Izaya?

8
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,810
Anyway, he's trouble, so don't get involved with him.

9
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,630
Oh, Simon.

10
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,570
He's supposed to get customers for that Russkie sushi shop.

11
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,760
Very good! Very good! {khorosho is russian btw}

12
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,660
This is Russian sushi!

13
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,700
It's yummy! It's cheap!

14
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,520
Mister, don't run away.

15
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,070
We have Russian sushi!

16
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,850
Excuse me.

17
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,690
Do you speak... Russian?

18
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,430
Yes, I do.

19
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,260
Ah, great.

20
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,230
Uh... Could you tell us how to get there from here?

21
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,060
You just have to follow that road.

22
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,150
Are you tourists?

23
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,090
Yes.

24
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,860
This is a charming city.

25
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,280
I'm sure you'll enjoy your time here.

26
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,360
Thanks for the help.

27
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,240
If you feel like it, stop by for some sushi.

28
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,920
Ikebukuro... This city that never sleeps stretches from east to west.

29
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,460
To the north, there's a large pleasure quarter.

30
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,830
A sprawling city where a million people gather everyday...

31
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,820
That's Ikebukuro.

32
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,330
This city is full of foreigners.

33
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,330
Like him...

34
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,790
And her.

35
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,450
They came here searching for something, seeking something.

36
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,090
They're here to change something.

37
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,800
We haven't chosen class representatives yet.

38
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,940
Do we have any candidates?

39
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,770
A new city.

40
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,710
No one who knows your past.

41
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,400
An opportunity to become someone new.

42
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,780
However...

43
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,800
Sonohara...

44
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,870
Sonohara Anri, right?

45
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,720
Any other candidates?

46
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,490
All right, you'll be the female class representative.

47
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,590
Take care of the rest, Sonohara.

48
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,700
U-Um...

49
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,230
Is there a boy willing to be class representative?

50
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,400
I kinda want to do it,

51
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,340
but it'd be a pain...

52
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,990
But I don't want any other guy to be paired up with her...

53
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,090
You should do it.

54
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,010
Me? Are you serious?

55
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,220
Man, that would be a pain.

56
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,730
But you'll get to pair up with her.

57
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,860
I'll do it.

58
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,650
U-Uh...

59
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,570
Ryuugamine... Mikado.

60
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,530
See ya.

61
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,700
Sonohara-san.

62
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,580
U-Uh, about the meeting with the other classes tomorrow...

63
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,840
I-I've never done anything like it before—

64
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,800
I'm sorry!

65
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,880
I have urgent business to take care of. Bye!

66
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,920
Dude, I better not underestimate you.

67
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,320
To think that you used to whine when someone spread rumors in
 elementary school about you being in love with your childhood friend.

68
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,630
Now you're a pretty active romancer, eh?

69
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,440
Yeah, whatever.

70
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,990
However, your finish was weak.

71
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:46,280
With that level of engagement, your happy-go-lucky love-comedy school life will stay a dream even though you finally made it here.

72
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,490
I never had that intention in the first place.

73
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,900
With that being said,

74
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,240
let's go hit on some chicks.

75
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,040
Me? Now?

76
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,150
Right now?

77
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:00,000
It's my time to be popular with the ladies!

78
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,260
I doubt they're interested in high schoolers.

79
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,470
They came here seeking change.

80
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:15,470
But changes don't happen that easily.

81
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,980
Even if you're standing on a different stage,

82
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,750
it's still the same old you standing there.

83
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,730
What? No way.

84
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,800
I already have a boyfriend.

85
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,950
That doesn't matter.

86
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,730
Even if a guy hits on you and invites you for a drink, it doesn't count as cheating.

87
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,270
Did you guys hear?

88
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,290
Yumi's new boyfriend is in the Dollars.

89
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,360
Are you serious?

90
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,370
Isn't she scared?

91
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,790
Hey, that's interesting.

92
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,000
Why don't we continue this in a café?

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,080
Aren't the Dollars like, a biker gang or something?

94
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,800
In this city, there are groups that commit violent acts from time to time.

95
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:57,480
Each group has its own color.

96
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,280
Thus, they're called "Color Gangs."

97
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,810
But the group that exercises its influence the most

98
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,680
doesn't have a specific color.

99
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,990
Simply put, they're transparent.

100
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,810
That's the "color" of the Dollars.

101
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:18,660
It's said that they're a special group that recruits members through their private website.

102
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:25,560
It's rumored that the recent hack-n-slash incidents are also the work of the Dollars.

103
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,420
Really?

104
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,790
Like I said, why don't you tell me the details in a café?

105
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,490
Dollars?

106
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,540
Yeah.

107
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,930
What kind of people are they?

108
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,930
They're awesome!

109
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,310
I heard they made a deal with the Triad recently.

110
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:46,190
Oh, and apparently it was one of the
Dollars who stabbed that yakuza.

111
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,190
Man, this sucks.

112
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,000
They all ran away because of that gloomy look on your face.

113
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,990
Kida-kun!

114
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,540
Hey.

115
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,970
Uh...

116
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,370
Your name was like a character's from a comic...

117
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,290
Mikado-kun, right?

118
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,380
We're going to Toranoana. Wanna tag along?

119
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:11,010
Susie Yasuda-sensei's signing her works today!

120
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,770
Dude, don't shout so loudly about that sort of stuff!

121
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,550
Why not?

122
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,810
What's wrong with talking about it?

123
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,290
Dollars?
What's wrong with talking about it?

124
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,890
Yeah, I've heard of them.

125
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,060
My friend told me a rumor today...

126
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,580
Well, I've never really seen them before.

127
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,770
Do they even exist?

128
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,860
You think they're just a fictional group made up on the Net?

129
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,690
Uh... I'm not really sure.

130
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:35,410
But if they really do exist, it's best
not to get involved with them.

131
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,660
Dollars?

132
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:42,520
They always fight against the Flame Haze that's sealed under the Sunshine 60, right?

133
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,160
You're wrong, Yumacchi.

134
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,420
They're angels that fly in the sky, show their panties, and shout, "Pipiru Pirupiru."

135
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,430
Why are you asking about them?

136
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,700
Uh, well...

137
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,880
Did the stories scare you?

138
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,380
I've heard a lot of rumors too.

139
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,380
They're very dangerous.

140
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,310
Really?

141
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,890
You shouldn't get too curious and go near them.

142
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,270
You know the deal about curiosity and the cat.

143
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,780
Kadota-san, you're so cool!

144
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:14,110
You're like the mature older brother of the protagonist.

145
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,950
Totally the dream man of girls into "dandy daddies."

146
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,630
No, no...

147
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,020
Shut up!

148
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,340
There are places you shouldn't go to in this city.
Shut up!

149
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,360
Tsundere hero spotted!
There are places you shouldn't go to in this city.

150
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,910
There are places you shouldn't go to in this city.

151
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,600
Your tummy won't be funny!

152
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,920
You should give it a shot.

153
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,920
One time won't kill you.

154
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,440
Man, I'm starving.

155
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,420
Yeah, me too.

156
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,930
Want to have something before we—

157
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,540
It's the Headless Rider!

158
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,320
No way!

159
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,850
Come on, why all this occult stuff in broad daylight?

160
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,120
Such a hard worker.

161
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:56,240
Sometimes, there are people who are swallowed by the city.

162
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,820
And there are people who look for them desperately...

163
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,830
I'll find her.

164
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,850
I'm sure I can find her.

165
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,830
My love will summon her.

166
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,620
Harima-san?

167
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,220
Harima-san!

168
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,710
I-I'm sorry! I thought you were someone else!

169
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,740
And the city is full of danger.

170
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,700
Hey.

171
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,710
Like here...

172
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,210
Hey, wanna have a drink?

173
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,500
And here.

174
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,330
He was supposed to be seeking change.

175
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,150
You serious?

176
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:16,110
He thought that something would change,

177
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,970
that something would happen in this new city.

178
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,130
However,

179
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:25,160
a deep darkness lurking in the shadows of the seemingly glamorous city was awaiting him.

180
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,320
His legs felt cramped.

181
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,680
He was losing his nerves from the anxiety of his inability to live in this city.

182
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,750
I understand how you feel!

183
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,400
On the train, you get treated as a molester.

184
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,110
On the street, you get shady invitations.

185
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,250
At home, you get in arguments with your neighbors.

186
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,690
And if that weren't enough, there's the Headless Rider and the Dollars.

187
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,510
That's Tokyo, the concrete jungle!

188
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,520
However!

189
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,060
Get over it!

190
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,390
If you pledge to be a bona fide Ikebukuronian,

191
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,270
you will overcome this ordeal, Mikado!

192
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,110
Yes, you! Ryuugamine Mikado!

193
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,390
Well, I'm with you, so no worries.

194
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,240
Kida-kun...

195
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,300
Oh, and when hitting on chicks, be sure to smile.

196
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,300
Got it?

197
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,560
I don't think hitting on MILFs is a good idea though.

198
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,910
What're you talking about?

199
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,630
I'm just talking to them.

200
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:28,480
Hey, haven't you gotten a bit cocky ever since Harima Mika disappeared?

201
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,390
I heard you became the class rep.

202
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,090
Aw, she's being bullied.

203
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,870
And the bullies are so awfully clichéd.

204
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,450
With that much makeup, even I'm not scared of them.

205
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,260
Youko's boyfriend is in the Dollars.
With that much makeup, even I'm not scared of them.

206
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,070
Youko's boyfriend is in the Dollars.

207
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,110
Hiroshi.

208
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,780
Yo! You!

209
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:47,160
Imma call my Dollars bros, so let's get this shit rollin'!

210
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,660
Eh, man?

211
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,290
People like this can be found anywhere in the world.

212
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,490
Having so many clichés is actually refreshing.

213
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,870
Uh, I better go help her.

214
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,800
But how would I do that?

215
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,990
Hey! Cut it out!

216
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,600
No... I'll get my ass kicked.

217
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,460
Then...

218
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,340
Wow, what a coincidence, Sonohara-san.

219
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:10,940
Let's go.

220
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,870
Whoa, he's so cool!

221
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,630
That's it!
Whoa, he's so cool!

222
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,310
That's the only way.

223
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,140
Bullies?

224
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,460
You're planning to stop them?

225
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:25,440
And in this city, unfathomable events occur frequently.

226
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,030
U-U-Um...

227
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,030
H-Huh?

228
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,530
H-Hey... Wha—

229
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,580
Huh?

230
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,580
H-Hey... Wai—

231
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,000
What is it?

232
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,740
E-Er...

233
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,220
You bullies are lame.

234
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,130
It's a terrible thing.

235
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,700
That's none of your business, old fart.

236
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,790
Yes, it's certainly none of my business if you get punched or die in a corner.

237
00:13:54,790 --> 00:14:00,470
Even if I punch you, and you call me an "old fart" despite me still being twenty three,

238
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,410
it doesn't change the fact that we're absolutely not related.

239
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,150
Huh?

240
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,820
Humans are so weak...

241
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:11,070
Well, I'm not into punching girls.

242
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,390
So,

243
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:22,170
I'll make stomping on a girl's cell phone my hobby.

244
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,600
What's with him?!

245
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,720
I got bored.

246
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,560
I'm done with that hobby.

247
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,060
Hi-Hiroshi!

248
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,810
Yo! Yo!

249
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,170
Yo!

250
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,770
Hey man!

251
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,570
You wanna fight?

252
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,620
Aw, I'm scared!

253
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,530
Y-You fucker!

254
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,950
I surrender!

255
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,730
Wait! Wait!

256
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,540
You'll pay for this!

257
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,600
Kamaitachi cometh.

258
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:29,600
But hey, it's really admirable to save a bullied girl.

259
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,670
It's been a while, Kida Masaomi-kun.

260
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,790
Yeah...

261
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,440
Hello.

262
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,230
That's Raira Academy's uniform, right?

263
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,870
Grats on being admitted.

264
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,000
Thanks.

265
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,750
It's unusual to see you in Ikebukuro, Izaya-san.

266
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,250
So this is the Orihara Izaya I shouldn't piss off?

267
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,550
Oh, he's just a friend of mine.

268
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm Orihara Izaya.

269
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,580
Nice to meet you.

270
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,180
I-I'm Ryuugamine Mikado.

271
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,230
Sounds like an A/C unit.

272
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,440
What brings you to Ikebukuro?

273
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,820
I just came here to see someone.

274
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,150
But I'm done with that already.

275
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,640
No way!

276
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,840
Was that the trash can from the convenience store?

277
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,390
It literally flew...

278
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,000
How?

279
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,800
Oh shit...

280
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,510
Izaya-kun.

281
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,930
A bartender?

282
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,770
Didn't I tell you never to come back to Ikebukuro?

283
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:48,520
I can't hear you, Izaya-kun.

284
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,570
Shizu-chan.

285
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,310
Weren't you working at the West Gate?

286
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,110
I got fired a long time ago.

287
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:00,090
And didn't I tell you to stop calling me that?

288
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:03,370
My name is Heiwajima Shizuo!

289
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,720
Heiwajima Shizuo?!

290
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,500
Another one of the people I shouldn't piss off?!

291
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,160
Oh, come on, Shizu-chan.

292
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,720
You're still pissed because I pinned that crime on you?

293
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,770
I'm not pissed.

294
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,930
I just want to beat the crap out of you.

295
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:27,780
Jeez, when you get violent, no logic or reason reaches you, Shizu-chan.

296
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,950
Oh boy, what should I do now?

297
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,730
Let me off the hook already.

298
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,580
Hey! That's him!

299
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,680
You got some balls to fuck with me!

300
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,470
We'll show you what it means to make fun of the Dollars—

301
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,200
A bartender outfit?

302
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,940
No way! He wasn't here a moment ago!

303
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,630
H-Heiwajima Shizuo?!

304
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,350
Who the hell are you?!

305
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,010
People lose the ability to think rationally when they're scared.

306
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,830
You just hit my head, eh?

307
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,050
You know that hitting a vital spot can kill someone, right?

308
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:35,840
You hit me there knowing that it could be fatal, right?

309
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:40,640
That means you have no complaints about what I do, right?

310
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,470
Those who wield a great power

311
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,100
will awaken instinctive fears in others.

312
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,840
He's like the embodiment of the word "violence."

313
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,020
He's like someone who lives off of violence.

314
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,580
No, he  is<i> violence.</i>

315
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,000
You cowards! Don't run away!

316
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,460
See ya!

317
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,720
You won't get away!

318
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,070
Why?

319
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,350
How?

320
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,680
He jumped from above?!

321
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,610
Let me answer the question in your head, even though it's not the one you should be asking.

322
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:47,410
I was just making a delivery to a regular customer living at the top of that building.

323
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,160
Simon, you bastard.

324
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,540
Shizuo, it's not good to fight.

325
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,710
Shut up!

326
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,040
Get lost!

327
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,630
H-Hey, Mikado!

328
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,390
Let's get outta here!

329
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,610
What? You serious?!

330
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,190
Mikado!

331
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,970
Hey! Wait!

332
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,790
S-Sorry!

333
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,760
The city also gives presents.

334
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,930
A very tiny, yet great miracle.

335
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,970
The adventure he has been desiring.

336
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,930
A possibility for the start of a new story.

337
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,630
And...

338
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:57,660
U-Um...

339
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,680
Thank you very much.

340
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,610
Please excuse me.

341
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,910
...there's also the possibility of nothing starting.

342
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,490
I found...

343
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,090
my love!

344
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,930
I heard the Dollars did it again.

345
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,140
Yeah! Same here!

346
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,520
They fought with a guy named Heiwajima Shizuo in broad daylight.

347
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,440
I heard the Dollars picked a fight.
They fought with a guy named Heiwajima Shizuo in broad daylight.

348
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,750
I heard the Dollars picked a fight.

349
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,940
A fight between Shizuo and the Dollars.

350
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,610
Looks like it.

351
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,190
No, that's wrong.

352
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,170
I happened to see it.

353
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,490
They were just impostors.

354
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,030
That's not all.

355
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:56,060
Recently, people who called themselves the
Dollars attacked and robbed a pedestrian.

356
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,990
What?

357
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:01,040
The Dollars are so scary and merciless.

358
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,590
You better watch your ass.

359
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,090
'Kay. Thanks.

360
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,520
They're really scary...

361
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,970
The Dollars.

362
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,250
Izaya came to Ikebukuro.

363
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,940
Just when I was going to kill him, Simon got in my way.

364
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:25,030
But... why did he come here?

365
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:29,700
This city is full of foreigners.

366
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:35,040
They came here searching for something, seeking something...

367
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,290
They're here to change something.

368
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,750
Welcome! Welcome!

369
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,500
Me too.

370
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,340
Eat some sushi.

371
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,100
Hey, listen to my story till the end.

372
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:22,020
The very unique story about me and her.

373
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,480
Next time: Alone With Just Your Shadow For Comfort.

374
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:30,120
I'm sure you'll be <i>non compos mentis</i> and trembling in fear.
