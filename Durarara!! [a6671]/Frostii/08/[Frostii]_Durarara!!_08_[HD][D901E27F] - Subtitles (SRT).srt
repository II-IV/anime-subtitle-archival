1
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,030
Aw, she's being bullied.

2
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,750
And the bullies are so awfully clichéd.

3
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,570
Right turn!

4
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,670
Well then, start talking.

5
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,800
Let's hear about the human experiments you're helping with.

6
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,300
It was me.

7
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,490
It had to be.

8
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,930
I wonder where I was headed?

9
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:23,850
I found...

10
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,270
my love!

11
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,850
Spare me your excuses.

12
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,480
Or will you be the "raw material"?

13
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,270
Give up.

14
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,570
Maybe it's fine to not have a head.

15
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,260
You always lose the important things, right?

16
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,350
Like the umbrella you just bought.

17
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,220
But you still have a ton of that vinyl crap.

18
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,430
Well, I don't care if it's an umbrella, but when you put your winning lottery ticket down

19
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,400
and can't find it afterwards, that sucks.

20
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,900
And then you always find other things when you're looking for something else.

21
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,960
Maybe we just think that the things we lose are really important.

22
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,110
Evening!

23
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,450
Are you guys looking for something?

24
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,810
Sometimes I think...

25
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:32,730
that my head might be awake while my body's asleep.

26
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,110
Ever since my memories became hazy,

27
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,600
the time passing by has felt ambiguous as well.

28
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,930
I wonder how long it's been...

29
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:49,530
since I've seen myself as a whole, even in my dreams?

30
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,410
Here and there...

31
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,720
What will I see on the other side?

32
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,280
What am I seeing?

33
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,610
In this ever-repeating dream

34
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,750
that I'm trying to decipher.

35
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,500
However, the dream never changes.

36
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,560
Selty!

37
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,010
I've got great news!

38
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,800
Last night, you said you didn't have to work today, right?

39
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:08,910
After some calculations, I've found out that it's your first day off in 265 days!

40
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,160
Your face doesn't look happy.

41
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,230
He reads my mood on the face I don't have.

42
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,530
I heard that people dream because their brains are sorting their memories.

43
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,120
Is this true?

44
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,260
What's with that sudden question?

45
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,460
You want to know why people dream?

46
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,350
Simply put, it's still unknown.

47
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,510
There are still many hurdles that medical science has yet to cross.

48
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,540
Especially in neuroscience.

49
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,420
The term "REM" comes to mind when talking about dreams.

50
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,620
You often dream during rapid eye movement.

51
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,210
He's a doctor.
You often dream during rapid eye movement.

52
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,600
To be precise, an underground doctor.

53
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,690
I don't know what he really does though.

54
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:03,190
It's all thanks to him that I can both continue my job as a transporter and have a place to stay. {well he is letting her stay here}

55
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,390
Well, first we have to answer the question, "What are memories?"

56
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,170
Are you listening?

57
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,830
I'm grateful to him.

58
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,280
And lately, when we're together,

59
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,400
I've realized that I'm in love with him.

60
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,830
However...

61
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:28,590
Well, you think your memories are in your head, but we don't know that for sure.

62
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,100
They're definitely there. Duh!

63
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,080
More importantly...

64
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,800
Let's get changed.

65
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,130
We can go out somewhere.

66
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,210
I'll take the day off too.

67
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,610
Look, I'm turning my cellphone off.

68
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,320
I'll unplug the network cable as well.

69
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,400
I swear I won't even check my mailbox!

70
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,740
We've got the whole day to ourselves!

71
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,810
So, where should we go?

72
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,250
A ride on your horse to the vast sea?

73
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,620
Or perhaps a trip to the spa?

74
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,790
I don't want to go anywhere.

75
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,080
Why not?

76
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:05,090
Well, since we're taking the day off, and as thanks for taking care of me, I'd like to cook for you.

77
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,300
Oh my! Home cooking?!

78
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,370
What would you like to eat?

79
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,720
I'll look for a recipe.

80
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,320
I'm so moved, Selty!

81
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,230
I wonder what's good.

82
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,120
Thanks for letting me borrow this, dude.

83
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,000
You're a real life saver.

84
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,780
Stupid me overslept this morning.

85
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,100
No worries, young man.

86
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,830
I figured the fatigue of coming all the way to Tokyo was catching up to you.

87
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,790
Yeah, you could call this a "hunter's chance"!

88
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,930
You sit shoulder-to-shoulder with your pretty neighbor and look at the same book.

89
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,900
And?

90
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,670
No necktie? Or did you forget that too?

91
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,440
Are you all right?

92
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,350
You sure you didn't forget your wallet too?

93
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,900
No way...

94
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,220
It's yummy!

95
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:10,840
Russian Sus—

96
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,060
Simon!

97
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,760
Have you seen Yumacchi?

98
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,490
Oh, Karisawa!

99
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,750
Do you want some sushi?

100
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,160
I haven't seen him.

101
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,010
So he wasn't here...

102
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:24,770
Dengeki Bunko's Accel World came out today.

103
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,490
We bought it together, had some tea, and then headed home.

104
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:34,040
But then the maid in the café told me that he forgot his cellphone.

105
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,800
Hey, don't ask customers then. {In notes. -des}

106
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,850
Hello? Excuse me.

107
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,880
What are you looking for?

108
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,540
I said, "I'm looking for Yumacchi—

109
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,520
Who are you?

110
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,320
Lost things? {the sign says the same}

111
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,940
Write what you're looking for on this.

112
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,700
Come on, tell me.

113
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,830
Are you going to walk around the city with that all day?

114
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,740
I'm asking everyone around.

115
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,250
My cellphone!

116
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,550
Welcome back!

117
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,260
What am I searching for?

118
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,010
Everything's cool now that Kaztano is safe and sound.

119
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:24,980
Even though I promised not to dig deeper...

120
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,810
Yagiri Pharmaceuticals...

121
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,290
It's said that they're working behind-the-scenes with the Awakusu Group,

122
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:35,570
and that they're connected to the North American Nebula Inc.

123
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,070
Either way, I'm not going to learn anything by standing here.

124
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,150
Have you seen Karisawa-san?

125
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,040
No.

126
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,770
Oh...

127
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,660
How about some Russian sushi?

128
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,400
Ah, Selty!

129
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,000
Use a kitchen knife, okay?

130
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,400
This is yummy!

131
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,630
Way too yummy!

132
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,140
Delectable!

133
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,640
Hold on! Why are you crying?

134
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,580
Crying?

135
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,790
They're tears of joy.

136
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,830
It's truly great.

137
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,710
This extremely sweet burdoc,

138
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,600
and the bitterness of the miso soup.

139
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,310
Something's not right...

140
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,440
No, no. Your cooking is just divine!

141
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,030
It's just like you!

142
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,170
That's not a compliment!

143
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,200
Okay, I understand. I got the taste wrong again.

144
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,060
It's all right. Don't force yourself to eat it.

145
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,320
That's not true.

146
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,210
It's so tasty.

147
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,500
Don't eat it!

148
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,090
What are you doing?

149
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,430
What's going on?

150
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,660
Hey, honestly, you're a good cook.

151
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,530
So what if you don't have watermelon cells?

152
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,660
What? Watermelon?

153
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,190
I'm talking about your sense of taste.

154
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:48,660
The brain can't understand tastes that aren't in your DNA.

155
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,170
But since you don't need to eat,

156
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,410
it doesn't seem to be an issue with the brain.

157
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,410
Come on, cheer up.

158
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,880
Let's play a game, 'kay?

159
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,810
Don't treat me like I'm a child.

160
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,260
That annoys me the most.

161
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,270
I'm not treating you like a child.

162
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:11,560
It's true that you've taught me many things,

163
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,270
but I have memories that stretch back 100 years.

164
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,650
And my head has even more...

165
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,740
Do you need memories from 100 years in the past?

166
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,280
What do you mean?

167
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,450
It's like I always say...

168
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,200
You're fine the way you are.

169
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,210
Do you know how I feel?

170
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,540
It's like I'm forgetting my own face!

171
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,510
Please wait!

172
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,060
I'm sorry!

173
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,520
Selty!

174
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,740
You came back?!

175
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,380
You can't do that, Doc.

176
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,160
We couldn't contact you during an emergency.

177
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,670
What's wrong, Sonohara-san?

178
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,840
They're not here.

179
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,640
"Not here"?

180
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,830
What?

181
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,890
What did you lose this time, Mikado?

182
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,070
Her shoes are gone.

183
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,330
What? Again?

184
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,060
Some people are so spiteful.

185
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,020
I have a pretty good idea who did this.

186
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,500
Kida-kun.

187
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,480
All right!

188
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,580
Hey, Kida-kun!

189
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:51,790
Kida-kun was a bit scarier than usual.

190
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,580
Really?

191
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,740
Sheesh, he just ran off.

192
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:16,190
When I was a kid, I often lost things.

193
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:20,080
I used to cry and shout, "It's not here!"

194
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,150
And my mom would always help me find it.

195
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,450
Sounds like you have a kind mother.

196
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,450
Yes, my dad is too.

197
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,960
I'm fine.

198
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,120
I'm going to go home.

199
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,860
Thank you for helping me look, Ryuugamine-kun.

200
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,750
Forget it, Kida-kun.

201
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,460
Nope, she went home already.

202
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,610
What? No idea.

203
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,650
Me?

204
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,610
I'm still looking for them.

205
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,110
Anyway, catch you tomorrow.

206
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:14,870
I found them!

207
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:25,880
What the hell am I doing?

208
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,580
Strange, isn't it?

209
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,780
I can't remember.

210
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,640
Vacant lots are pretty strange.

211
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,650
When it's gone, you just forget what was there.

212
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,270
There was something here not too long ago.

213
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,110
Something really big...

214
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,700
What am I doing?

215
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,680
I get irritated when Shinra tells me to stop looking for my head.

216
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:03,040
But having a job and friends...

217
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,500
Do those make me feel human?

218
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,370
So, didn't you want to talk to me?

219
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,900
I remember!

220
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,020
Wasn't there a tall, thin, blue building here?

221
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,000
Oh, that old one?

222
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,330
There was an old woman selling cigarettes on the first floor.

223
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,460
Good catch, transporter.

224
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,740
I can feel my head in this city...

225
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,130
Hello! How is it going?

226
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,090
Me?

227
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,800
I'm searching for beautiful Japanese.

228
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,610
Please tell me what you're desperately looking for.

229
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,270
Can I take a look?

230
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,780
Okay.

231
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,540
I wonder if she met him.

232
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,920
I looked for many things today.

233
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,970
I managed to find some of them, but not all.

234
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,780
Since his bag was gone, I assumed he was at work.

235
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,580
But...

236
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,870
something felt different.

237
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,910
Fireworks?

238
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,760
Yeah.

239
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,550
With a lot of bang.

240
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,140
We put him back together with help from a lot of people.

241
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,700
Just fireworks?

242
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,390
You got some harsh staff.

243
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,400
It's a real pain.

244
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,460
He was blabbering some nonsense.

245
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,740
Apparently his girlfriend was kidnapped,

246
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,050
and she could only remember this place.

247
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,690
He wanted to know what we did to her.

248
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,410
Well, that isn't nonsense; it's the truth.

249
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,480
Can you make it

250
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:51,530
so that he won't remember anything about us when he wakes up, Doc?

251
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,340
You can't erase memories that conveniently.

252
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,180
Besides, I'll remember him.

253
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,510
We'll send him back.

254
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:05,100
Maybe to his home, maybe somewhere else.

255
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,690
Doc, the chief and I put our trust in you.

256
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,070
You're still keeping our secret.

257
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:25,860
Oh yeah, you're living with a rather eccentric person, right?

258
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,040
At that moment, I forgot...

259
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,500
about my head,

260
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,590
and the memories of several hundred years as a Dullahan in my head.

261
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,310
I wasn't thinking of anything.

262
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,850
Just... Just...

263
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,430
Hey, won't you come with me?

264
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,870
If I ask for seats for two people, the restaurant won't complain.

265
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,280
I know a great place.

266
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,750
Please, Selty.

267
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,560
Eating alone is terrible.

268
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,800
What's with this mysterious, avant-garde dish?!

269
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,180
Karaage sushi, cheese sushi, mabo sushi,

270
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,840
prosciutto sushi,

271
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,460
and this is our sour cream sushi.

272
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,500
You don't have to make sushi out of them!

273
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,620
What are you saying?

274
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,010
This is a special set!

275
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,920
It's great service!

276
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,850
So, we got fortune cookies for dessert.

277
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:46,840
Oh boy.

278
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,210
They have a fortune inside.

279
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,670
Open it.

280
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,500
This is yours.

281
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,580
Let me see.

282
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,150
This means you'll find what you're looking for.

283
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,220
I didn't know you'd be that happy.

284
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,910
I'm so happy, Shinra!

285
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,910
What does yours say?

286
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,300
Mine didn't have one.

287
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,920
I can't cry.

288
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:53,210
I wonder if my head cries when I'm sad?

289
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,280
Thank you.

290
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,910
I hope not.

291
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:19,380
I hope I'm smiling.

292
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,590
What's wrong?

293
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,610
You're still afraid...

294
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,790
We're alone.

295
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,600
There's no one there.

296
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,950
Can you remember anything?

297
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,470
You don't have to.

298
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,930
I told you, didn't I?

299
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,320
I don't need your past or future.

300
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,860
Just stay as you are.

301
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,630
We're in the eternity now. {In notes. -des}

302
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,330
I love you, Selty.

303
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,080
That night, after a long time,

304
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,270
I had a dream where I was whole.

305
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,270
I am here.

306
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,780
Right here.

307
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,430
My love is different.

308
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,560
It's different from the love where the more you seek for it, the more you get spoiled. {In notes. -des}

309
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,730
It's something more complete.

310
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,440
Next time: Love and Care.

311
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,240
I am what Seiji needs.
