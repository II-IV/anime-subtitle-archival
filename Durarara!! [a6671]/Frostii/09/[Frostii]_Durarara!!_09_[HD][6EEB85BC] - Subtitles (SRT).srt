1
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,750
I have to take care of something very important to me.

2
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,300
It's like I'm forgetting my own face!

3
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,260
Uh...

4
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,550
Get away!

5
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,340
H-Hey!

6
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,180
Yagiri Pharmaceuticals, eh?

7
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,970
Do they really

8
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,990
perform human experiments here?

9
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,640
That's not Harima Mika.

10
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,400
Spend as much money as you want.

11
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,060
We have all the time in the world.

12
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,710
I love you, Selty.

13
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,520
People are fake.

14
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,720
This world is full of fakes.

15
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,910
They say stuff like "I love you," or "I adore you," and rob others of their freedom.

16
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,780
"Look only at me. Stay by my side and desire me."

17
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,280
Such spoiled kids.

18
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,330
My love isn't like that.

19
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,750
It's more perfect, and has no boundaries.

20
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,310
I know, Sis.

21
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,090
Thanks for the money. {lit deposit}

22
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,160
Bye.

23
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,450
Want me to buy you something to drink?

24
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,890
Look, the vending machine is right over there.

25
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,110
I'll be right back.

26
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,860
You're so cute.

27
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,450
You still haven't found him?

28
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,180
No. I'm very sorry.

29
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,160
What the hell were the guards doing?

30
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,460
According to the guard on duty last night,

31
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,260
Seiji had stayed at the same hotel for a while,

32
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,710
but suddenly changed locations in the middle of the night.

33
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,950
He answered his phone around seven.

34
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,130
If something were to happen to him...

35
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,580
He promised not to leave Ikebukuro, so they'll find him soon.

36
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,640
Listen.

37
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,230
What do you think will happen to us if the cops see that thing?

38
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,230
Well...

39
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,310
Whatever.

40
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,230
I don't have the patience for you people.

41
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,490
Chief.

42
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,820
I will be back soon.

43
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,920
To me, that thing was just a doll.

44
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:39,670
It was like one of those pretty, expensive, imported dolls my uncle bought for me as a child.

45
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,950
I've never liked dolls.

46
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:51,220
I don't think he sent them because he wanted to please me,

47
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,730
but because he liked them.

48
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,650
Hey, Seiji, look at this.

49
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,940
Pretty, isn't it?

50
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,090
Let's see what we've got here.

51
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:14,790
What is it?

52
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,480
The house was always tranquil,

53
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,560
and Seiji and I were always alone.

54
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,820
Before Seiji was born, I often spent my time in my uncle's care.

55
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,760
I even had free access to his study.

56
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,640
That thing was sitting there.

57
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:42,720
My uncle would stare at that thing, apparently smuggled in from a foreign county, as though it fascinated him.

58
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,900
He would even talk to it from time to time.

59
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,050
It truly was beautiful.

60
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,720
More beautiful than any doll he ever sent me.

61
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,360
Without feeling a sliver of cruelty or curiosity,

62
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,330
I perceived the head itself as a living entity.

63
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,590
It was nothing more to me.

64
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:12,220
That's why I secretly let my brother into the study to play.

65
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,720
Maybe I just wanted to share that secret.

66
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,690
Pretty, isn't it?

67
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,310
That's when it all started.

68
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,030
It's the one regret I still have to contend with.

69
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,350
This is the first time we've met, right?

70
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,660
Did the list of illegal immigrants help you, Yagiri Namie-san?

71
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:07,280
Ah, I'm so overjoyed and honored that the chief of Yagiri Pharmaceuticals' Sixth Research Lab has personally come to such an unworthy place.

72
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,970
Please have a seat.

73
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,430
This is an emergency.

74
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,040
Find out where my brother is.

75
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,300
I don't care how much it costs.

76
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,330
I haven't gotten hold of him since last night.

77
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,100
He must be somewhere in Ikebukuro.

78
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,650
Oh, it hasn't been that long.

79
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,550
Why are you so worried?

80
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,590
He's with a woman.

81
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,760
A girl with scars around her neck.

82
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,330
A girl?

83
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,070
Oh, he's at that age.

84
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,230
Get your ass moving!

85
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,200
Hey, hold on.

86
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:47,090
Aren't there a lot of other important things I should investigate?

87
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:53,970
There's a rumor that the foreign Nebula Inc. will take over your company, right?

88
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,490
Then, you'll—

89
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,380
Orihara Izaya-san.
Then, you'll—

90
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,310
Orihara Izaya-san.

91
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,200
There's no time for that.

92
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,850
Oh, that's unexpected.

93
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,210
I never would have imagined that a woman as successful as you would be in love with her brother.

94
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,710
What do you think you know about me?

95
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,300
The Yagiri Namie-san I know is an excellent woman.

96
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,470
I mean, even though the company's run by your family,

97
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,500
your father was fired because of his mistakes.

98
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,930
And I heard the current president, your uncle, is a rather laid-back person.

99
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:26,940
In other words, you joined the company and didn't let your youth stop you from rising to the position of chief.

100
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,940
Not to mention your beauty.

101
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,530
I see you did your research.

102
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:35,740
It shouldn't be a problem for you to find my brother.

103
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,040
Your brother, huh?

104
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,990
I don't think it's a good idea to interfere with his affairs so much.

105
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,300
That's not true!

106
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,920
No one else can protect him but me!

107
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,360
You know, stalkers don't realize what they're doing.

108
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,630
They think they're protecting—

109
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,340
Never group me with stalkers!

110
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,140
Wow, scary!

111
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,850
I'm just kidding.

112
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,960
All right, I'll help you.

113
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,310
However, I'll do it my way.

114
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,850
You know, informants aren't the same as cops.

115
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,100
What rules are you playing with?

116
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,320
Just one question:

117
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,350
Are you jealous of that girl with the scar around her neck?

118
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,200
Why do you ask?

119
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,430
There's no way I'd be jealous of her.

120
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:36,610
This crimson, rusty jealousy burning in my heart is...

121
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,680
Sis, there's someone I love.

122
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:46,600
I realized that Seiji was acting stranger with every passing day.

123
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,000
He would recklessly ask to enter our uncle's study,

124
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,190
and the first thing he'd do after sneaking in was gaze at that thing.

125
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,810
He didn't fall in love with a person,

126
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,240
but something without feelings, let alone a body.

127
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,610
I wanted to get that thing as far away as I could from Seiji,

128
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:14,270
so the moment I joined the company, I asked my uncle to let me use it as a research subject.

129
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,230
Since then, Nebula Inc. started staying in contact with us,

130
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,970
and I was desperate to keep our research from leaking.

131
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,270
That was when my security card was stolen.

132
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,730
Only I had that card.

133
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,480
Sis...

134
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,770
I've killed someone.

135
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,380
What do I do now?

136
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:51,760
The feeling I had back then was neither fear nor anger.

137
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,310
It was an indescribable feeling of bliss and joy.

138
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,800
Seiji needed me.

139
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,780
You don't have to worry about a thing.

140
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,240
Leave everything to me.

141
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,160
Okay?

142
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:21,490
I'm not talking about the body. I mean that girl.

143
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,490
So you're the one who took her.

144
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,400
Don't worry.

145
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,080
Leave that to me as well.

146
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,700
It'll be all right.

147
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,060
I promise.

148
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:42,300
I didn't know that a stupid girl named Harima Mika was stalking him.

149
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,660
When she let herself into his room and saw that thing, Seiji...

150
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,140
I'll protect you no matter what.

151
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,540
Ah, there we go.

152
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Looks like there's no need for you to panic.

153
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,880
The cops will take him into custody and call you soon, I guess.

154
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,400
Well, don't worry when I say, "the cops."

155
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,290
It's not a biggie.

156
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,200
I think.

157
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,820
Are you kidding me?!

158
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,060
Hello.

159
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,500
Yes, that's me.

160
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,780
Huh? What's wrong?

161
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,790
We're leaving?

162
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,330
But we just got here...

163
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,060
Hey, wait.

164
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,540
I'm really glad that you love me so much.

165
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,700
I love you too.

166
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,710
Forever and ever.

167
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,450
I'm scared!

168
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,710
About what?

169
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,800
Please, take me somewhere far away!

170
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,180
I want to be alone with you too.

171
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,190
But where do you want to go?

172
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,310
What's that?

173
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,810
A lover's quarrel?

174
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,920
Help!

175
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,430
Help! Stop!

176
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,590
Please calm down.

177
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,330
We're not suspicious.

178
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,680
No! Stop it!

179
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,760
Listen to—
No! Stop it!

180
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,570
Let go of her!

181
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,740
I'm fine.

182
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,960
It doesn't hurt.

183
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,620
Just go.

184
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,540
I don't know why, but you need to chase after her, don't you?

185
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,040
I've always wanted to say this:

186
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,300
"Go on and leave this to me!"

187
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,260
Wait!

188
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,710
S-Sorry.

189
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,160
Are you okay?

190
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,810
You're...

191
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,440
Wait!

192
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,900
No, <i>you</i>  should wait!

193
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,120
Let go of me!

194
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,470
Let go dammit!

195
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,430
Is she your girlfriend?

196
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,240
Yeah!

197
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,930
She's my soul mate!

198
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,150
Why is she like that?

199
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,440
The hell if I know!

200
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,340
What the hell?!

201
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,770
You don't know anything about the person you love?

202
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,960
Quite irresponsible, aren't we?

203
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:49,840
That doesn't matter when you're in love.

204
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,360
What?

205
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,340
Then how can you call her your soul mate?

206
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,250
Because I love her.

207
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,840
I need no other reason!

208
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,350
You cannot put love into words!

209
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,360
That's why...

210
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,250
I'll show it through my actions!

211
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,410
I will protect her!

212
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,510
That's all!

213
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,710
I like you more than Izaya.

214
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,910
That's why I'll let you off the hook for this.

215
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,140
Fuck, it's gonna bleed when I pull it out...

216
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,520
Should I buy a band-aid first?

217
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,380
Or should I buy some super glue?

218
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,450
In other words,

219
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,450
your head's attached to a body and walking around?

220
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,180
When you caught her, a high schooler got in your way,

221
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:06,140
and when you were chasing her, another high schooler popped up and ran away with your head?

222
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,410
Do you honestly expect me to believe that?

223
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,010
I won't force you.

224
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,690
I believe you.

225
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,150
But why was Shizuo-kun there?

226
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,160
Ah, I completely forgot to mention that.

227
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,350
I was waiting in the park because of the job Izaya gave me.

228
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:24,570
Then Shizuo passed by and we started talking.

229
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:31,090
W-Well everything's okay, since he called and said the job was canceled.

230
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,910
Orihara-kun, huh?

231
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,240
Anyway, I wanted to talk to you.

232
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,620
Looks like you're still perplexed.

233
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,810
You're always welcome to talk to me.

234
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,080
And besides! Why the heck is my head on another body?!

235
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,290
Well, as I haven't seen it, I can't say anything for sure.

236
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,900
But if you want to hear my theory...

237
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,680
Hmm...

238
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,010
He found a girl whose body matched your head,

239
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,540
and replaced her head with yours.

240
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,020
That's creepy!

241
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,770
Or maybe it's a fresh corpse.

242
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,400
Stop that!

243
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,880
But...

244
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,030
That... That's just...

245
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,800
I don't believe I did anything wrong.

246
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:30,420
After that incident, I created her for Seiji.

247
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:31,910
I have to go.

248
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,360
It's okay.

249
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:33,840
Everything is all right.

250
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,320
I have to go.
Everything is all right.

251
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,090
I have to go.

252
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,400
You must have been scared.
She...{************** check}

253
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,260
But nothing happened to you.

254
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,570
Even after she ran away from here and spent time together with Seiji,

255
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:46,560
my love didn't waver at all.

256
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,870
His love exists because he can use my love as a stepping stone.

257
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,930
He knows that.

258
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,960
And I know that he knows that.

259
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,130
It's quite perverted. {not in the sense of fucking}

260
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,190
Yet, I still...

261
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,550
Damn...

262
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,910
That bastard was wearing Raira Academy's uniform.

263
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,850
Who is he?

264
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,220
I got it.

265
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,330
Leave it to me.

266
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,570
Anyway I have to find that kid from Raira Academy.

267
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,780
Then, I'll have a talk with my head.

268
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,930
You mean the head didn't scream until it saw you?

269
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:22,740
What do you want from that "head" that's living as a human, as a whole entity?

270
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,870
Are you telling me that you'll sever the head just because you want it?

271
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,560
Selty.

272
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,860
I don't want to admit...

273
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,360
that my head and memories are lost...

274
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,200
I don't want to admit that everything I've done in the past twenty years was for nothing!

275
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,250
It wasn't.

276
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,180
I'll definitely get her back.

277
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,590
Just wait here.

278
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,250
Oh.

279
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,170
What happened to your cellphone?

280
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:00,880
Did you lose it?

281
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,810
I don't know.

282
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,000
It was gone.

283
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,860
Even though I put it in my bag.

284
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,780
Huh?

285
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,170
She...

286
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,770
She needs me.

287
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,100
We have to be alone.

288
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,900
I see.

289
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,150
It's okay. Leave everything to me.

290
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,230
That rascal. {she means the head}

291
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:33,720
That doll should have done what a doll does: nothing.

292
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,060
And quit interfering with my love.

293
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,580
I've made up my mind.

294
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,750
I don't want to regret anything anymore.

295
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,760
Never again.

296
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,700
Understood?

297
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,490
Call all the subcontractors.

298
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,200
I don't care if it's dead or alive.

299
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,180
If you have no other choice, destroy it on the spot.

300
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,000
Looks like everyone's pretty busy.

301
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,890
This is gonna be fun!

302
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,250
So fun! So fun!

303
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,730
There are so many things in this city even I, The Informant, don't know!

304
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,270
Things appear and vanish!

305
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,620
That's exactly why I can't leave a city where people gather!

306
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,840
I love humans!

307
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,160
I love them!

308
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,070
I've got butterflies!

309
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,520
That's why...

310
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,490
humans should love me too.

311
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,810
Thank you.

312
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,540
Have you calmed down?

313
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,480
Can you answer my questions?

314
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:04,570
You said you don't remember anything.

315
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,770
In other words... Amnesia?

316
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,740
Uh... Well, I'll be repeating myself...

317
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,400
but maybe you should go to a hospital or the police.

318
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,560
Sorry!

319
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,690
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

320
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,530
It's okay.

321
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,860
No need to apologize.

322
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,450
I have to go.

323
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:32,120
Before that person meddles again.

324
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,640
Forever and ever.

325
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,790
I have to go...

326
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,080
Seiji...

327
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,600
Seiji-san...

328
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,340
I love you. {You're all frickin mental.}

329
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,220
Uh...

330
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:21,020
The headless rider, Orihara Izaya, and the girl with a scar around her neck appeared again.

331
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,830
Not only that, the guy in the adjacent class is a member of the Dollars!

332
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,790
Next time: The First and Probably the Last.

333
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,610
I've dreamed of a not-so-casual life, but...
