1
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,670
Wow.

2
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,750
This is even cooler than Ginza Kami-Sakura.

3
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,120
Well, that's all I know. I really have no idea.

4
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,230
And there are a dozen other dangerous folks around here,

5
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,740
so you'd better watch out.

6
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,690
Oh, you saw that black bike?

7
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,350
We haven't had such a sweet deal for a while now.

8
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,890
And it's fucking jailbait.

9
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,520
Props to the informant.

10
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,570
At that moment I noticed that I was trembling.

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,610
Is the reality you perceive "real"?

12
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,320
The familiar scenery is still the same.

13
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,980
I'd like to congratulate everyone on their admittance.

14
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,700
Currently, Japan is suffering from issues like declining birthrates and class stratification.

15
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,320
However, when I see the fine young people lined up before me,

16
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,350
I can only see a bright future before us.

17
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,780
I believe that Japan is still in good shape.

18
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,800
It brings a smile to my face.

19
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,800
Today must be a good day for you...

20
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:43,300
I wonder if today will be mellow again.

21
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,020
I-I'm Ryuugamine Mikado.

22
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,100
A shy boy that just recently came to Tokyo...

23
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,050
I'm Sonohara Anri.

24
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,400
Nice to meet you all.

25
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,950
A girl that gives off the feeling of naivety...

26
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,310
I am Kida Masaomi!

27
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,340
Despite looking a bit mature,

28
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:12,200
I'm actually a fragile, easily hurt fifteen-year-old kid like all of you.

29
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,840
A boy that lives in his own saccharine dreamworld...

30
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,730
I'm Kamichika Rio.

31
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,720
Nice to meet you all.

32
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,760
A girl with an enigmatic past...

33
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,930
They're people you'd see on the street.

34
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,170
Harima...

35
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,430
Is Harima Mika here?

36
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,520
Absent...

37
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,430
A mundane, familiar scenery.

38
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,450
Nice going on the first day.

39
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,780
We were introducing ourselves.

40
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,410
You can introduce yourself from there.

41
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,890
I'm Yagiri Seiji.

42
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,630
Nice to meet all of you.

43
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,770
However, there are unexpected moments

44
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:01,120
when reality shows its other face.

45
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,010
Take your seat, Yagiri.

46
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:05,930
I won't.

47
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,840
I don't think I'll be able to come to school for a while.

48
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,560
No, perhaps I'll never come back.

49
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,900
I just stopped by to say that.

50
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,120
Please excuse me.

51
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,340
Hey, Yagiri, what's the meaning of this?

52
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,080
That's it.

53
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,310
I have to take care of something very important to me.

54
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,610
I can't deal with you people.

55
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,080
Bye.

56
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,770
H-Hey, Yagiri!

57
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,560
Wait!

58
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,080
Wait, I said!

59
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,590
A sudden crack in the peaceful life disturbs the people.

60
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,600
And we have a girl who took a peek at that crack.

61
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,180
Actually, she was supposed to be dead two days ago.

62
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,730
She was born in a normal household.

63
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,490
She lived a life without any problems or poverty.

64
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,370
However, when she entered middle school,

65
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,410
an envelope was sent to her, like an ambush.

66
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,750
What was in the envelope?

67
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,600
Pictures.

68
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,900
Looks like my dad's having an affair.

69
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,970
He's seeing another woman.

70
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,260
And there was a letter.

71
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,270
"Could you forgive him?" it asked.

72
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,870
I think the person who sent the letter is somehow related to that woman.

73
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,270
Of course, your father isn't completely innocent,

74
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,770
but neither is the one who sent the letter.

75
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,120
I was so perplexed that I didn't know what to do.

76
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,350
I decided to hide the envelope for the time being.

77
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,700
Since then,

78
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,700
I became disgusted with the normal atmosphere in the house.

79
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,010
It was hard, wasn't it?

80
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,080
What's the matter, Rio?

81
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,420
I could only endure it for six months.

82
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,650
I thought everything would get better if I confronted him about it.

83
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,570
You don't have to talk about it if it's too hard for you.

84
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,900
There are things I don't want to share with others too.

85
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,580
It's okay.

86
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,610
I want you to know.

87
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,990
I can't believe I thought the TV remote was my cell phone.

88
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,080
Nothing had changed.
I can't believe I thought the TV remote was my cell phone.

89
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,120
I can't believe I thought the TV remote was my cell phone.

90
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,090
I know. That was silly.

91
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:37,250
I wasn't sure if my mother had decided not to bring it up, or if they'd discussed it before.

92
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:42,000
Both my father's lame jokes, and the overly sweet taste of my mother's stew...

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,250
Nothing had changed.

94
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,650
So I thought, "I should disappear to cause a change."

95
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,500
Lately, my mind has been full of such thoughts.

96
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,130
I'm in a situation like yours.

97
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,320
It's not as serious as yours though.

98
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,610
What happened?

99
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,270
There was a girl I was going out with,

100
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,570
but she was impregnated by my dad.

101
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,770
That's horrible...

102
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,120
But the person I absolutely couldn't forgive was my mother. {well couldnt forgive most}

103
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,750
What did she say?

104
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,300
She said it happens all the time,

105
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,710
and that we have a reputation to protect, so we shouldn't make a fuss about it.

106
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,990
She didn't say anything about how she felt.

107
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:35,770
I thought she cared more about our reputation than about me.

108
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:40,770
But maybe she was thinking about my future.

109
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,350
I doubt that.

110
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,750
You think?

111
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,940
She isn't thinking about you at all, Nakura-san!

112
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,190
She's just selfish! Only thinking about herself!

113
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,650
Dinner's ready.

114
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,490
I'm coming.

115
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,670
Say, Magenta-san, will you disappear with me?

116
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,040
If both of us die,

117
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,520
I'm sure they'd finally realize...

118
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,050
what they should have cherished.

119
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,860
In retrospect, it was a pretty foolish decision.

120
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,430
But she left the house with determination.

121
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,140
She felt some strength in Nakura's words.

122
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:29,680
She wanted to see the person who shared her thoughts with her own eyes.

123
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:35,650
Even if it had been a lie, she had nothing to lose.

124
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,790
Or so she thought.

125
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,610
Yes?

126
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,920
Magenta-san?

127
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,040
Yes.

128
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,440
Are you Nakura-san?

129
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:48,940
All right. I knew it was you.

130
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,740
When she saw him, she thought...
All right. I knew it was you.

131
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,130
"Is this man really Nakura?"
Nice to meet you.

132
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,590
Likewise.

133
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,830
She followed him
Likewise.

134
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,630
Should we go then?
She followed him

135
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,350
because she wouldn't forgive herself if she ran away.
Should we go then?

136
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,010
because she wouldn't forgive herself if she ran away.

137
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:00,910
Okay.
because she wouldn't forgive herself if she ran away.

138
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,390
because she wouldn't forgive herself if she ran away.

139
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,430
So, even if this happens...

140
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,780
Hey.

141
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,510
Hello.

142
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,280
Anyone around?

143
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,670
Not a single soul.

144
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,000
Well...

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,630
Sorry for tricking you!

146
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,790
Various emotions such as fear, regret, and resistance
Sorry for tricking you!

147
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,500
Various emotions such as fear, regret, and resistance

148
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,090
were juxtaposed in her,

149
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:34,640
but before she lost consciousness, she thought,

150
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,670
"This must be my fate."

151
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,970
Was there really any reason to care about herself?

152
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,350
She would just vanish from this world,

153
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,320
without anyone noticing.

154
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,270
However...

155
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,230
Someone <i>is</i> around.

156
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,380
Even when she was unconscious, the world kept revolving.

157
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,670
Well, it's not really a hard job.

158
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,180
Either way, be careful.

159
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,940
Her feelings and will were irrelevant.

160
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,300
I can't.

161
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,630
I just couldn't get the money together.

162
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,580
I'm not saying that I can't pay it back.

163
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,490
But if something were to happen to me,

164
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,780
Shiki-san from the Awakusu group wouldn't stay quiet—

165
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,850
Listen, old man.

166
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,270
I don't have time.

167
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,930
It's not that I'm busy,

168
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:15,260
but the time that I'll waste on you is just two and a half minutes!

169
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,470
And the other guy you shouldn't piss off is...

170
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,590
Yo!

171
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:39,090
I don't think it's necessary to tell an excellent transporter like you how to do it,

172
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,110
but you don't need to do more than I've asked.

173
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,600
Just smack some sense into them.

174
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,460
Have fun.

175
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,210
The world is revolving.

176
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:56,080
Things were going a bit astray from the "fate" the girl believed in.

177
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,210
Hey.

178
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,170
Wh-What the fuck are you?

179
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:06,540
It read, "I've been asked to bring you to a certain place."

180
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,360
The bike moved silently.

181
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,430
But sometimes it neighed like a horse.

182
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,410
It felt unreal.

183
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,810
Yet this empty feeling was real.

184
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,550
The girl wondered what lay beyond that warmth.

185
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:30,160
What were that person's thoughts? What did they know? How did they live?

186
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,870
How did she appear to that person?

187
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,610
Okay.

188
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,260
Magenta-san.

189
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,270
Nice to meet you. I'm Nakura.

190
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,770
Are you really Nakura-san?

191
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,530
Correct. The Nakura who wants to disappear.

192
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,930
I'm really delighted to meet you.

193
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,040
Did you save me?

194
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,310
Yes, it was me.

195
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,410
Thank you.

196
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,870
Were you scared?

197
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,790
Yes.

198
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,040
You must have felt terrible.

199
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,330
Yes...

200
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,420
But how did you know I'd been kidnapped?

201
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:13,390
Well, because I asked them to.

202
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,790
And it was also me who saved you.

203
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,520
What's going on here?

204
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,840
You were suicidal, but you got kidnapped.

205
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,080
And you were a bit frustrated at yourself for getting scared.

206
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,540
But if you'd resisted, it'd mean that you'd denied the you that wanted to die.

207
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,730
So you just accepted the events, forcing yourself to believe it was your fate.

208
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,290
But now that you've been rescued, you feel relieved.

209
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,790
I just wanted to see that expression.

210
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,860
In other words,

211
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,920
I wanted to see your dumbfounded face when someone saw through you.

212
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,280
Why?

213
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,510
Good question.

214
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:01,920
Well, I believe the answer might sound quite philosophical to you.

215
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,090
Okay. If I had to explain it...

216
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,500
It's because I like humans.

217
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,970
Humans are so interesting and amusing.

218
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,530
I just can't help myself.

219
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,030
Oh, to make it clear, I just like humans.

220
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,530
That doesn't mean you in particular.

221
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,040
Keep that in mind.

222
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,450
It was all a lie?

223
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:25,040
Have you finally realized your place?

224
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,500
Come on.

225
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,940
Quite a few people have jumped from here.

226
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,240
Well, not enough to make this place famous.

227
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,180
But if you jump from here, your death is certain.

228
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,310
Look at that stain.

229
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,740
Say, don't you think you're special?

230
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,540
That's not true.

231
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,610
We're all the same.

232
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:07,750
No one in the world can live honestly.

233
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:12,170
Even you have a secret or two.

234
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:16,630
Haven't you ever wondered why you're so perfect while your parents are so pathetic?

235
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,640
Well...

236
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,880
If I came to a conclusion...

237
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,640
The show goes on, and everyone laughs at lame jokes or eats overly sweet stew,

238
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,900
regardless of whether they're having an affair or whether their wife knows about it.

239
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,350
Take a good look.

240
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,750
Despite all their worries, they're all bloodstains adorning the pavement now.

241
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,700
Nothing more. Without exception.

242
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,300
All are equal in front of the Lord.

243
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:46,960
Should I let go of your hand?

244
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,460
See?

245
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:58,680
Anyway,

246
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:05,770
I'm glad I was able to see your ugly feelings today.

247
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,390
I'm not really interested in your problems,

248
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,050
but in the way you live when they stress you out.

249
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,900
Oh, and you were awfully boring. Your life was just as I imagined.

250
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,150
I knew from the beginning that you weren't serious about dying.

251
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,410
Have a good night.

252
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:23,200
It was fun, Magenta-san.

253
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,560
She hesitated for a second.

254
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,770
Would she be able to hurt him if she jumped?

255
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,420
But then she thought...

256
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,980
Maybe she'd just been waiting for the opportunity.

257
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:55,070
And that opportunity came from that man's words.

258
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,920
But without being aware...

259
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,770
Hey...

260
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,290
Why did you...

261
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,290
Sheesh, acting on your own again...

262
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,140
Then, she thought about her parents.

263
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,120
Her dad and his lover.

264
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,030
Her dad and her mother.

265
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,270
And she also thought about the times she didn't see them.

266
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:20,390
Maybe they weren't as wicked, selfish, and hate-filled as she thought.

267
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,530
Perhaps they weren't veiled by her own weakness and compromises.

268
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:27,530
As she tried to find her way back home,

269
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,680
she thought about forgiving them.

270
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,750
Ever since that day, the world has appeared completely different to her.

271
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,500
There are as many feelings and secrets as there are people.

272
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,050
She realized that it was very normal.

273
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,920
Where do ya wanna go?

274
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,320
I'll take you anywhere, so uh, treat me.

275
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,620
Let's see...

276
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,520
How about a bookstore?

277
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,070
Well, there are a lot of them...

278
00:20:55,070 --> 00:21:00,280
Even these two normal school boys have their secrets.

279
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,570
Feelings they can't share with anyone.

280
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,070
Please wait!

281
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,200
Yagiri-kun, what's bothering you?

282
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,280
I have no idea what you're talking about.

283
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,240
Y-You can't skip school on the first day.

284
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,780
Leave me alone!

285
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,560
Wait!

286
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,790
Hey.

287
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,250
Is something wrong?

288
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,530
What's up?

289
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,350
I'm such a lady-killer.

290
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,690
That girl with glasses has fallen head over heels for me.

291
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:35,920
I could see her anxiety about the dangerous and risky days awaiting her.

292
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,980
Mind translating that into Japanese?

293
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,980
And he...

294
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,980
And she...

295
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,260
What they see might not always be reality.

296
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,840
And so, she started to ponder...

297
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,690
Will a day come when she can say those words to someone?

298
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,270
"Because the world isn't as cruel as you think it is."

299
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,510
I didn't know you became a Champion of Justice.

300
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:13,010
I thought I asked an excellent transporter...

301
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,760
No way!

302
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,690
Me, Orihara Izaya, a mere informant, isn't that relentless.

303
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,240
But I'm not nice enough to stop anyone who wants to die.

304
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,740
It was fun, excellent transporter.

305
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,050
Ikebukuro.

306
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,750
He, she, me, and you...

307
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,930
We came here searching for something,

308
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:20,890
seeking something,

309
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:24,230
to change something.

310
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,810
Next time: Rampant.

311
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,270
You want some sushi? It's yummy.

312
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:30,380
Hey, Mister, long time no see.
