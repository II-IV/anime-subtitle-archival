1
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,250
Good luck, Tanaka Tarou-kun!

2
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,710
I'll keep this as a member of the Dollars.

3
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,240
Hey, haven't you gotten a bit cocky ever since Harima Mika disappeared?

4
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,920
How is it possible for her to die?

5
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,210
Did you hear about it?

6
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,620
There was another slasher incident in Ikebukuro.

7
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,930
Then maybe I'll start a war that only I can fight.

8
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:19,800
Right?

9
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,350
Enough is enough!

10
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,420
Come one, come all!

11
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,160
We have Russian sushi!

12
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,010
It's yummy! It's cheap!

13
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:02,820
Come eat sushi.

14
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,890
"Slasher"?

15
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,470
It appeared again.

16
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,130
How many did it get?

17
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,780
I'm standing at the location of last night's slasher incident.

18
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,910
A large meeting had been abruptly called in Ikebukuro's business district.

19
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,330
The slasher incident also began around that time.

20
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:30,210
Young people are talking about a legendary "headless rider"...

21
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,290
American organizations are contacting the headless rider to determine the technologies used—

22
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,280
The slasher?

23
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,020
The headless rider...

24
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,750
So scary...

25
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,720
Every day, something new appears, and something else disappears.
So scary...

26
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,090
No way!
Every day, something new appears, and something else disappears.

27
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,890
Every day, something new appears, and something else disappears.

28
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,950
Yet nothing happens.

29
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,810
Nothing changes.

30
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,600
That's her normal life.

31
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,410
Our love is completely fake.

32
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,750
But it's stronger than real love.

33
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,460
I'm in love with the scar on your neck.

34
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,300
And this love is connected to a real one through this scar.

35
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,390
I love you.

36
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:22,310
I will love all of you with all of myself!

37
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,240
Looking at them fills me with envy.

38
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,600
Then stop looking.

39
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,770
We look if we see a pretty girl!

40
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,530
And then we go talk to her!

41
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,480
That's our destiny as members of Team Boys, since it's engraved in our DNA!

42
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,280
Don't group me with you.

43
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,990
But don't worry.

44
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,280
My body belongs to everyone,

45
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,490
while my heart belongs only to you, Anri.

46
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,350
I've always wondered...

47
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,360
Why are you so erotic and cute?

48
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:57,010
Not erotic, Masaomi!

49
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,050
I see.

50
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,880
You don't see her as erotic, but you do agree on the cute part.

51
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,800
Well, um...

52
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,760
Are you saying Anri isn't cute?

53
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,550
Sh-She is!

54
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,050
She is, but...

55
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,710
Ah ha! So you do admit that she's cute.

56
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,190
But I also admit that she's erotic.

57
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:22,490
So I understand and love her more, since I love the erotic part too.

58
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,120
Thus, I win!

59
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,870
Six months ago, there was an incident.

60
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,250
Everyone in town and at school talked about it then.

61
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,930
But it has nothing to do with her.

62
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,210
She's not interested in it.

63
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,750
Are you okay?

64
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,030
Y-Yeah. Thanks.

65
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,340
Nothing happens.

66
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,920
And nothing changes.

67
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,780
That's her normal life.

68
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,810
Hurry up.
Thank god we had enough points saved up!

69
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,220
Thank god we had enough points saved up!

70
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,430
Yumacchi, whatcha gonna do with that poster?

71
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,520
She's going pretty fast today.

72
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,810
Isn't she driving around more boldly than ever?

73
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,600
Yeah.

74
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:46,400
I wish someone like her was more secretive.

75
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,730
It'd be much better if only we knew the truth, like a lady's secret.

76
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,120
That must be like Nogizaka Haruka's "Secret." {I have no idea what this is exactly referencing - never seen the anime, never read the book}

77
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,340
Guys...

78
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,960
Don't blame her.

79
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,630
She must have her reasons.

80
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,260
Hey, check it out!

81
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,630
It's the headless rider!

82
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,800
This is Celty Sturluson's normal life.

83
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,740
This is an everyday occurrence.

84
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:56,350
People panic when they face an extraordinary situation.

85
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,500
She flees from the scene using that.

86
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,480
That's how Celty Sturluson usually handles such situations.

87
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,060
However...

88
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,070
I've always thought...

89
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:13,410
In movies and comics with monsters like you, we're always the dying pawns.

90
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,370
When a superhero appears,

91
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,580
we're always the dead bodies lying in pools of water to show how strong the monster is.

92
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,980
But that's fine.

93
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:29,280
It means that we're normally considered pretty strong.

94
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,260
It's an unavoidable part of the plot.

95
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,400
But I've always wanted to tell your kind...

96
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:40,520
If a monster, evil telekinetic, android, or ninja makes their appearance...

97
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,540
Just one thing...

98
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,940
I only have one thing to say to you:

99
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,940
Don't take the traffic police unit lightly, you fucking monster.

100
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,320
Let me say it again, you damn monster.

101
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,490
Don't take the traffic police unit lightly.

102
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,760
Celty!

103
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:12,920
Welcome hom—

104
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,970
What? What's going on?

105
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,630
Getting hugged by you makes me feel like the Supreme Being.

106
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,440
Wait, I didn't say that quite right.

107
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,280
Hey, you're shivering.

108
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,190
Seriously, what's going on, Celty?

109
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,010
I-It was scary.

110
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,460
So scary, Shinra!

111
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,340
Th-The police these days are like monsters!

112
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,800
The police?

113
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,750
About ten police bikes and cruisers were chasing me like they were a single living organism!

114
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:12,390
Actually, I remember hearing about this biker cop being transfered here just to deal with you.

115
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,040
I think his name is Kuzuhara Kinnosuke.

116
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,240
He's a troublemaker who forces the target into an accident.

117
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,590
It was scary.

118
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,950
So scary.

119
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,320
I've been too conceited.

120
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,130
I'll be more modest from now on, so please forgive me.

121
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,250
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

122
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:29,740
I'm sorry.

123
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,800
Who are you apologizing to?

124
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,130
This isn't like you at all.

125
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,760
You should only show your feminine side in bed—

126
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,790
Stop saying embarrassing things in this situation.

127
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,020
Yeah, that's it.

128
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,580
A-Anyway, I know you've been through a lot,

129
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,520
but can you go pick someone up?

130
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,710
It's not a job.

131
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,320
He's back...

132
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,800
My dad, that is.

133
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,080
Seriously, he should catch a taxi.

134
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,090
He's always picked on me.

135
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,040
Hey man.

136
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,550
Come on.

137
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,640
Say something.

138
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,420
You're so white.

139
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,680
Don't tell me...

140
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,700
What the fuck's wrong with him?

141
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,630
You like his dress, Horada-san?

142
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,810
Gentlemen, Tokyo's air is ugly.

143
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,900
Don't you agree?

144
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:44,920
Actually, your ugly faces are perfect as camouflage in this ugly air.

145
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:49,070
Hey, this dude's got a screw loose somewhere.

146
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,240
Who cares?

147
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,510
Looks like it's time to show you the power of grown ups.

148
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:11,390
You must think that because you're protected by the Juvenile Law, you can kill anyone anytime.

149
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,540
But remember this:

150
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,480
When you try to kill someone, you better be prepared for the possibility of being killed by your targ—

151
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,340
You're fucking crazy, man.

152
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,660
I'm over twenty.

153
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,240
Hold on a minute.

154
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,350
That seriously hurts.

155
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,660
And you're stepping on my shoe, so I can't flee.

156
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,000
The finger's stabbing me!

157
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,990
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

158
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,490
Don't just stand and watch, Celty-kun!

159
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,110
Come on, save me!

160
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,010
I don't want to...

161
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:53,770
Don't you realize that I acted tough because I saw you and thought that there wasn't anything to worry about?!

162
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,780
Hey, Horada-san, this is the black biker dude.

163
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,910
What? You serious, Higa?

164
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,530
Dead serious. I saw it on TV.

165
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,230
I heard you were at the Dollars' meeting six months ago.

166
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,550
Man, you're all trying to take away our area.

167
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,300
Come on, say something.

168
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,410
What the hell's this?!

169
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,910
W-W-Wait up!

170
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,710
Yeah, this is how people are supposed to react.

171
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,790
Good, it's not broken.

172
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,530
This is a precious device that Shinra gave me.

173
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,030
Take that!

174
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,110
This is the power of grown-ups!

175
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,610
I just can't grow to like him.

176
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,540
Is this really good for anything?

177
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,770
And seriously, how are you supposed to play like this?

178
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,260
Russian sushi! Russian sushi!

179
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,380
President!

180
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,090
Hey, Izaya!

181
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,780
Hey, working hard as usual?

182
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,780
You've been around Ikebukuro a lot lately.

183
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,380
Why don't you stop by my place?

184
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,700
I just opened a fresh can of fish.

185
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,280
It's still fresh.

186
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,400
Sorry, but I'm actually kinda busy.

187
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,290
I'll stop by some other time.

188
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,170
Hey.

189
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,920
You can't hide a gimlet in a bag.{japanese saying}

190
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,570
Don't talk about ropes in a house where a man hung himself.{is it a russian saying?}

191
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,930
Right?

192
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:41,150
Let's take turns and list what's good about Anri.

193
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,470
I'll start.

194
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,380
She's erotic.

195
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,570
You're starting with that?

196
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,790
Let's stay away from that topic.

197
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,250
Those who underestimate sex will cry about sex.

198
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,830
Start making more sense.

199
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,670
This was her first time being friends with guys.

200
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,400
Then, Mikado, say something good about Anri.
This was her first time being friends with guys.

201
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,140
Well, I think...
This was her first time being friends with guys.

202
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,380
More accurately,
Well, I think...

203
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:56,690
"There is nothing good about Anri. Bleh." Right?
More accurately,

204
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,920
she probably had never been friends with anyone before this.
"There is nothing good about Anri. Bleh." Right?

205
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,330
I didn't say that!

206
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,250
Then say it.

207
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:02,930
Say it now.

208
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,080
Come on, say it.

209
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,940
W-Well, um...

210
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,800
Once, she was merely someone who enhanced Harima Mika's presence.
W-Well, um...

211
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,340
3, 2, 1... Bzzt! You lose!
Once, she was merely someone who enhanced Harima Mika's presence.

212
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,830
But it was fine with her.

213
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,550
That was where she belonged.

214
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,550
But...

215
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,680
now that she'd lost that place,

216
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,350
she was unable to find where she stood.

217
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,980
Fine.

218
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,860
Let's all go hit on some chicks so I can prove how ero-cute Anri is.

219
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,190
What kind of excuse is that?

220
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,650
B-But... hit on girls?

221
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,110
Don't you worry.

222
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:38,120
You're just bait to make them to relax by thinking, "He's with another girl, so he should be safe."

223
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,970
You don't need to do anything.

224
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,550
Hold on, Masaomi!

225
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,480
Let's go!

226
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,990
Follow me, gang!

227
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,170
Ready, set, go!

228
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,670
Here I come!

229
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,870
K-Kida-kun?

230
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,310
Masaomi!

231
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,990
Was that really okay?

232
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,070
It's fine.

233
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,430
He'll go hit on girls anyway, even if we don't tag along.

234
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,910
Seriously.

235
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,380
He's such a handful.

236
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,200
I need to give Mr. Shy at least this much handicap.

237
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,050
I'm such a badass.

238
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,970
Hey...

239
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:43,580
She was aware that the two boys had feelings for her.

240
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,550
But...

241
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,980
Oh, it's a pretty sunset.

242
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,240
But there's an ominous-looking cloud over there.

243
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,420
It might rain later, so let's be careful.

244
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,840
Yes, we should.

245
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,440
Um...

246
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,110
Yes?

247
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,500
I'll excuse myself here.

248
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,540
See you tomorrow.

249
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:14,010
Y-Yeah, see ya.

250
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,030
Using the sunset was way too cheesy.

251
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,860
She probably couldn't give a reply if either one of them confessed his love to her.

252
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:30,020
She still liked Harima Mika, even to this day.

253
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,790
And she liked those two just as much.

254
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,260
She wasn't aware of the difference between friendly love and romantic love.

255
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,540
To her, Harima Mika is...

256
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,690
Ryugamine Mikado is...

257
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,540
Kida Masaomi is...

258
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,080
You really won't?

259
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,550
We're really not the same without you.

260
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:57,490
I already told you, I have nothing to do with you anymore.

261
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,550
I don't belong here.

262
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:05,220
I have zero desire to return to that life.

263
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,310
I've been seeing more yellow people recently.

264
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,060
Yellow?

265
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,770
I know.

266
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,680
And because they're very visible, they stand out more than the Dollars.

267
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,830
Oh, you mean the Yellow Napkins?

268
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,640
You know about them too, Setton?

269
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,870
Well, yeah...

270
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:02,320
They've been around for a while.

271
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,240
Yellow Napkins?

272
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,490
They're the gang that used to hang around Ikebukuro before.

273
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,540
They went missing after they had a fight with another gang.

274
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:14,120
Oh yeah, I heard about that.

275
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,960
Does this mean they're back?

276
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,000
Ikebukuro is getting to be pretty scary.

277
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,060
I know.

278
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,930
The police are scary too.

279
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:23,970
Seriously.

280
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,220
Please don't take the police lightly.

281
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,470
The police?

282
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,760
Shit, she's on her knees.

283
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,380
So lame.

284
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,860
We only tapped you.

285
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,540
You're so clumsy.

286
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,320
Because you're a parasite.

287
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,280
What are you looking at?

288
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,700
And the slasher incident still isn't resolved.

289
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,540
By the way, have you heard...

290
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,750
that the slasher is actually the work of the Dollars?

291
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,040
There's also a rumor that it's the headless rider.

292
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,920
What?! Who said?!

293
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,740
I really doubt it.

294
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,800
All joking aside,

295
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,760
you should really be careful about the Yellow Napkins.

296
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:08,220
Some members hold a grudge against the Dollars for getting big while they were gone.

297
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,890
I see...

298
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,810
All right, I'll be careful.

299
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,830
You whore.

300
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,550
You're going after Ryugamine and Kida after getting dumped by Harima.

301
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,520
And now Nasujima.

302
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,250
How many more people are you gonna whore out to?

303
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,660
Dating whore.

304
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,010
You're always depending on someone.

305
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,160
Parasite!

306
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,410
Parasite! Parasite!

307
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:39,170
The girl knew that their accusations were true.
Parasite! Parasite!

308
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,410
She was dependent on Harima Mika.

309
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,430
And she probably still is.

310
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,060
Don't just sit there!

311
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,360
Say something.

312
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,930
Or is a parasite unable to even speak?

313
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:54,390
Or maybe she's depending on those two boys.

314
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,440
Like trying to find her place among them.

315
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,200
You fucking stink, parasite.

316
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,670
Stop coming to school.

317
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,990
We've already lost two boyfriends because of you!

318
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,200
Don't just sit there, bitch!

319
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,830
And like this, she's been protecting her own body and mind.

320
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,070
Nothing will happen.

321
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,350
Nothing will change.

322
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,210
This is her normal life.

323
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,540
You live around here, don't you?

324
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,760
Let's see it.

325
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,670
We'll check it out.

326
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,210
Come on, show us.

327
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,700
Here he is!

328
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,280
Oh.

329
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,150
Huh?

330
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,990
I'm the one who wants to slash!

331
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:55,620
He's the one who's been spamming Ikebukuro-related BBS and channels since about six months ago, right?

332
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,170
You haven't banned him?

333
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,250
I did!

334
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,430
But it never works!

335
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,670
Oh, I see.

336
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:09,890
I ban him by remote host name, but he just joins from another one.

337
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,180
Is he using a proxy?

338
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,020
I don't think he is.

339
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,150
That's kinda creepy.

340
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,110
Nothing will happen.

341
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,610
Nothing will change.

342
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,310
That's her...

343
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,760
There's a slasher somewhere in this town.

344
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,430
And each time there's an incident,

345
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:25,020
the fear and anxiety creates countless rumors in the heavy, stagnant breeze of the night.

346
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:26,520
But...

347
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,420
Next time: Reigning Turmoil.
