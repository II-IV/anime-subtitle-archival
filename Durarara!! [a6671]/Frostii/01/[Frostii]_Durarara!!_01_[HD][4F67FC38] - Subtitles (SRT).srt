1
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,200
In retrospect, it was pretty strange.

2
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,280
But...

3
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,950
for some reason,

4
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,950
I don't feel that it was strange.{This repetition is deliberate}

5
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,460
Either way, it was a turning point in my life.

6
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,380
Then again, it doesn't feel like anything changed at all.

7
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,960
It really was an awkward experience.

8
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,660
However, you might stumble upon it anywhere.

9
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,320
Here, in Ikebukuro.

10
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,650
S-So s-sorr... y.

11
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,150
I want to go back.

12
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,660
Please don't laugh at me.

13
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,660
Kakamura
In both elementary and middle school, I skipped all the field trips.

14
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,710
In both elementary and middle school, I skipped all the field trips.

15
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,500
See ya.
In both elementary and middle school, I skipped all the field trips.

16
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,160
I've never been outside my hometown.

17
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,820
Nara
I've never been outside my hometown.

18
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,170
This is the story of a confused fifteen-year-old boy who came to Tokyo.
Nara

19
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,790
This is the story of a confused fifteen-year-old boy who came to Tokyo.

20
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,260
The protagonist is me, Ryuugamine Mikado.

21
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:43,240
So why is a shut-in like me standing on a platform of the Tobu Tojo line, looking around cluelessly?

22
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:49,370
Because I'll start attending Raira Private Academy in East Ikebukuro this April.

23
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,420
You could say the school is pretty reputable.

24
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,190
They take great care of the buildings, and the classrooms are well equipped...

25
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:58,320
but the real clincher was an invitation from my best friend in elementary school.

26
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,650
My parents hated the idea and wanted me to attend a nearby school,

27
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,420
but my fascination with Tokyo made me ignore them.

28
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,080
Mikado!

29
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,120
Huh?

30
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,450
Kida-kun?

31
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,040
What? You're not sure?

32
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,740
All right, I'll give you three options.

33
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,380
One: Kida Masaomi.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,760
Two: Kida Masaomi.

35
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,550
Three: Kida Masaomi!

36
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,140
Whoa! Is it really you, Kida-kun?!

37
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,090
Come on, don't ruin the hilarious joke I worked on for three years.

38
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,770
Glad to see you again, dude!

39
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,700
I really didn't recognize you. You've changed so much.

40
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,460
I never imagined that you'd dye your hair!

41
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,230
Oh, and that was a lame joke.

42
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,890
Well, no wonder. It's been four years since we last met.

43
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,080
But hey, you haven't changed one bit since elementary school.

44
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,500
Oh yeah, don't be a party-pooper.

45
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,750
This is my best friend, Kida Masaomi.

46
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,990
He transferred when we were in elementary school.

47
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,750
But he hasn't changed at all, except for his appearance.

48
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,310
Right, let's go.

49
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,010
Let's get out of here.

50
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,670
I'm in the mood to make a Journey to the West.

51
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,800
I'm a crooked tour guide who'll send you to the Seibu exit instead of the West exit.

52
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,260
His jokes suck, but he's a great friend.

53
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,320
I chat with him online every day,

54
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,540
so I hadn't realized {how much time had passed, and }how far apart we'd drifted.{This line is too long for the original}

55
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,770
So, do you know the difference between the West and Seibu exits?
so I hadn't realized {how much time had passed, and }how far apart we'd drifted.{This line is too long for the original}

56
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:17,270
But now that we've met after four years,
So, do you know the difference between the West and Seibu exits?

57
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,410
The Tobu department store is on the west side,
But now that we've met after four years,

58
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,280
I finally realize that we've been living far apart.
The Tobu department store is on the west side,

59
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,030
and the Seibu department store is on the east side.
I finally realize that we've been living far apart.

60
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,900
Shit, why am I explaining my failed jokes to you anyway?

61
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,350
Even though his jokes suck even worse now,
Shit, why am I explaining my failed jokes to you anyway?

62
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:28,610
Whatever.
Even though his jokes suck even worse now,

63
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,280
he's still the same old friend.
Whatever.

64
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,790
Any place you want to go?
he's still the same old friend.

65
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,980
Any place you want to go?

66
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,470
Let's see...

67
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,500
Sunshine 60?

68
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,000
Right now?

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,800
If you're going there, you'd better take a girl with you.

70
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,050
U-Uh... Then how about Ikebukuro West Gate Park?

71
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,080
Dude, just say WGP.

72
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,050
But do all the Ikebukuronians call it that?

73
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,190
Hah, Ikebukuronians?

74
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,140
What? You really wanna go there?

75
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,980
Well... Uh...

76
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,140
H-Hey!

77
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,140
F-Forget about it. It's pretty late already.

78
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,490
We'll be killed by a Color Gang.

79
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,200
I can't believe you just said that.

80
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,070
Besides, it's only six o'clock.

81
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:12,050
Sheesh, you're still a chicken.

82
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,030
Good evening.

83
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,160
'Sup.

84
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,170
Ah, Setton-san,

85
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,260
you know, starting tomorrow I'll be living in Ikebukuro.

86
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,890
Yeah?

87
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,970
Maybe I'll end up living close to you.

88
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,320
Who knows?

89
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,590
I'm still at my old place right now,

90
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,680
but tomorrow I'm moving to an apartment
near the Sunshine Building.

91
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,320
Welcome to Ikebukuro.

92
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,530
Wow.

93
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:49,570
The realm I've only seen in comics and on the Net is right in front of me.

94
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,650
This is even cooler than Ginza Kami-Sakura.

95
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,710
All right, I'll take you to Shibuya next time.

96
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:00,710
If you're that fascinated by crowds, maybe I should take you to a horse race.

97
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,520
There aren't as many Color Gang members as before.

98
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,040
Until last year, quite a few conspicuous people were still on the streets,

99
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,220
but most of them got arrested for starting a gang war in Saitama.

100
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:16,000
So, if a crowd of people dressed in the same colors gathers,

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,380
the cops rush over.

102
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,980
In other words, this place is pretty safe now?

103
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:28,190
Well, that's all I know. I really have no idea.

104
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,320
And there are a dozen other dangerous folks around here,

105
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,050
so you'd better watch out.

106
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,620
I see.

107
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,010
By the way, this is 60 Floor Street.

108
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,210
There's also a Sunshine Street.

109
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,920
I wonder if Sunshine Street came first.

110
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,940
S-Sorry!

111
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,090
Oh, hey, Kida-kun.

112
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,950
Oh, if it isn't Karisawa-san and Yumasaki-san.

113
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,790
'Sup?

114
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,180
Hey, fancy seeing you here.

115
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,850
'Sup.

116
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,500
How you doing, Kida?{deliberate slang}

117
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,650
Oh, hello.

118
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,450
Who's he?

119
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,150
Your friend?

120
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,030
Yeah, he's my childhood friend.

121
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,140
He just moved here today.

122
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,650
Oh, yeah?

123
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,700
This is Karisawa-san.

124
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,280
And this is Yumasaki-san.

125
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,910
Uh, and over there we have Kadota-san and Togusa-san.

126
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,820
U-Um...

127
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,790
I'm Ryuugamine Mikado.

128
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,340
Did I say something wrong?

129
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,970
Is that his pen name?

130
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,880
Why would a high schooler use a pen name?

131
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,360
Oh, maybe he's on the radio, or a writer for a magazine.

132
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,060
N-No... It's my real name.

133
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,950
You gotta be kiddin' me! Are you serious?

134
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,550
Whoa dude, that's pretty awesome!

135
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,980
He's like the lead guy straight out of a comic!

136
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,360
Geez, you're gonna make him blush!

137
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,340
What should I do?

138
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,950
I can't keep up with the conversation.

139
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,160
You guys are on your way back from shopping?

140
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,110
Yep.

141
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,940
The new publication of Dengeki Bunko came out today,

142
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,710
so we bought thirty of 'em.

143
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,800
Do they publish that many in a month?

144
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,930
No, no, you've got it wrong.

145
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,470
Ten for me, ten for him,

146
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:15,300
and ten... for other things.

147
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,320
Yep, for other things.

148
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,810
I wonder what they mean by "other things."

149
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,640
For themselves? To sell? Or to display on their shelves?

150
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,190
Anyway, we gotta go.

151
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,520
See ya later.

152
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,820
Yeah. Bye.

153
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,280
Should we carry this by the head?

154
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,780
Bye.

155
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,880
Don't hit the car, you morons!

156
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,050
Er, yeah, they're a little weird,

157
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,140
but they're great people if you're friends with them.

158
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,290
I didn't expect you to hang out with people like that.

159
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,550
I've got my dick in many holes, ya know?

160
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,340
I know the places where you can get clothes cheaply,

161
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:52,990
I wonder what he's done for the past four years...
I know the places where you can get clothes cheaply,

162
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,300
or how to bargain with the vendors on the street.
I wonder what he's done for the past four years...

163
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,400
while I stayed inside my house in the country.

164
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,780
Well, if you're knowledgeable about lots of things,

165
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,600
you can strike up a conversation with almost any girl.

166
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,810
Yeah, "dick in many holes."

167
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,730
I found her.

168
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,830
You sure?

169
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,490
The description matches completely. There's no mistake.

170
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:17,780
Got it.

171
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,040
Let's go.

172
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,970
Aye.

173
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,160
Don't fuck up the dose, 'kay?

174
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,940
They'll pay less if she doesn't wake up.

175
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,500
Who cares?

176
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,590
They pay a fifty percent bonus for a teen.

177
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,900
Twenty percent, dude.

178
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,890
We haven't had such a sweet deal for a while now.

179
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,300
And it's fucking jailbait.

180
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,160
Yeah.

181
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,620
Props to the informant.

182
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,830
Good evening.

183
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,910
Oh, you were here, Kanra-san?

184
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,650
I was actually on the phone.

185
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,980
Ah, I just read the scrollback.

186
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,320
You're coming to Tokyo?

187
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,190
Congrats.

188
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,440
Want to meet?

189
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,860
Sure, sounds great.

190
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,120
Yeah.

191
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,490
Ah, speaking of meetings...

192
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,740
You know, there are suicide meetings.

193
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,750
Yeah, they were Topic A for a while.

194
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,040
People meet on the Internet and commit suicide.

195
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,790
Ugly subject, eh?

196
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,040
But I haven't heard about them on the news recently.

197
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,210
Perhaps they failed at it.

198
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,180
There might be quite a lot of them,

199
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,050
but perhaps no one's noticed.

200
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,600
Like the bodies haven't been found... yet.

201
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,700
Dude, don't joke about that.

202
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,420
Oh yeah, lately a lot of people have disappeared.

203
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,310
Really?

204
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,810
Uh...

205
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,770
It's usually an illegal immigrant,

206
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,640
or a kid who ran away from home.

207
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,760
There seem to be many cases between Shibuya and Ikebukuro.

208
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:42,860
Excuse me.

209
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,330
Yes?

210
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,160
Magenta-san?

211
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,710
Yes.

212
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,910
Are you Nakura-san?

213
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,240
All right. I knew it was you.

214
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,070
Nice to meet you.

215
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,460
Likewise.

216
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,570
Should we go then?

217
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,630
Okay.

218
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,680
It's right around the corner.

219
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,020
There are two more coming.

220
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,690
I see.

221
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,770
That's it.

222
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,070
Hey.

223
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,150
Hello.

224
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,780
Anyone around?

225
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,310
Not a single soul.

226
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,290
Well...

227
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,040
Sorry for tricking you!

228
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,940
Someone <i>is</i> around.

229
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,700
Kida-kun kept talking without stopping for breath.

230
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,360
I was actually getting a bit tired,

231
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,160
either from walking around so much,

232
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,720
Well, we always chat, but now that you're actually here,
or from pointing out his lame jokes.

233
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,120
Probably both.
Well, we always chat, but now that you're actually here,

234
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,870
I realize that I've still got a lot to talk about.
Probably both.

235
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,080
I realize that I've still got a lot to talk about.

236
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,970
Y-Yeah.

237
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,940
I feel like I haven't told you even 5/400th of what I wanted to say.

238
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,720
By the way, Karisawa-san and Yumasaki-san took up 4/400.

239
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,010
Just when I was thinking of a comeback, a guy caught my eye.

240
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,170
It's been a while, Miss.

241
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,650
A man dressed as a chef trying to get customers...

242
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:37,430
Let me correct myself: a tall, black man dressed as a chef...

243
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:42,050
No, someone dressed like a chef who's supposed to get customers and who is, for some reason, black...

244
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,490
Hey, Mister, long time no see.

245
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,640
Hey, Simon!

246
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,370
It's been a long time, man!

247
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,910
Oh, Kida, you want some sushi?

248
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,900
It's yummy.

249
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,990
I'll make it cheap for ya.

250
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,570
Sushi is good, good.

251
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,180
Cut me some slack, man. I'm broke today.

252
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,100
I'll drop by when I get paid.

253
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,340
Make sure to gimme a handsome price then.

254
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,910
Oh, no!

255
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,140
They're gonna throw me off the bay onto Russian land.

256
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,220
Onto land? How you gonna drown there?

257
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,060
See ya.

258
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,720
Hey, Mister, long time no see.

259
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,830
You know him?

260
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,840
Yeah, he's Simon.

261
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,710
He's a black Russian.{was Afro-American from Russia, but I like the joke}

262
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:28,570
He's supposed to get customers for that Russkie sushi shop.

263
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,010
Uh... What part don't I get?

264
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,230
I'm not kidding you.

265
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,210
His real name is Semyon.

266
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:38,070
But everyone calls him by the English equivalent, Simon.

267
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,300
I don't know the details,

268
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,340
but apparently his parents were deported from the US or something.

269
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,380
So, he ended up working here because his friend started a sushi bar.

270
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,660
You better not fuck with him, okay?

271
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,860
I saw him stop a fight once.

272
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,380
He grabbed some fucking giant as big as he is with just one arm.

273
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,200
And the other guy you shouldn't piss off is...

274
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,790
Huh? What the hell?

275
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,080
Speak of the devil.

276
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,440
Anyway, don't go near Heiwajima Shizuo.

277
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,170
If you live a normal life, you won't meet him, so do that.

278
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,080
Wh-What kind of monster is he?

279
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,820
Eh? They're still not here?

280
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,430
That's strange.

281
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,480
The higher-ups can't get their asses in gear, eh?

282
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,940
They'd better put some effort into this deal.

283
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,800
Who cares?

284
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,000
We don't have anything better to do anyway.

285
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,320
Yeah.

286
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,470
You gotta cherish your free time.

287
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,570
A short break from our chaotic life...

288
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,260
Oh yeah, I saw that black bike today.

289
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,510
Black bike?

290
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,340
You haven't heard of it before?

291
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,680
Everyone in Shinjuku and Ikebukuro is talking about it.

292
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,810
It used to be an urban legend,

293
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,520
but now people have pics of it and stuff.

294
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,310
Ah, yeah. I've heard about it.

295
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,650
Isn't it just some guy from a biker gang?

296
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,360
Uh, he doesn't ride with a group though.

297
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,370
He's got to be a retard for driving around without lights.

298
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,740
If he's even human, of course...

299
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,870
What do you mean?

300
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,150
Uh, how should I say it?

301
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,400
Simply put... he's something like a monster.

302
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,300
Hey.

303
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,430
Uh, are you one of the higher-ups?

304
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,100
Of course not.

305
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,310
Then who is that?

306
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,450
Are you fucking with us?

307
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,540
Can't you see that we're busy?

308
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,910
I'll beat your brains out if you get in our way!

309
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,470
Wh-What the fuck?!

310
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,600
Shit!

311
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,850
H-H-H-Hey!

312
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,020
Shit! Stop it!

313
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,260
Stop it!

314
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,100
I told you to stop it.

315
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,010
Shit.

316
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,590
Shit! Shit!

317
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,450
What the...

318
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,480
What the fuck?

319
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,480
What the fuck?!

320
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,980
What do you mean by "a monster"?

321
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,660
Dotachin says he's a Grim Reaper.{shinigami - I'd prefer either the native Japanese or death god}

322
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,680
Dotachin?

323
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,650
Who's that?

324
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,200
You know, the guy who rides that black bike doesn't...

325
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,710
Hey, you switching topics?

326
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,080
Fuck you!

327
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,620
Suck it down!

328
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,280
Son of a bitch!

329
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,230
...have a head.

330
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,870
He moves just fine despite being decapitated.

331
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:45,890
H-Hey... What the fuck are you?

332
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:50,140
Y-You bastard!

333
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:16,250
Hey, are there other people I should avoid?

334
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,900
Well, leaving aside the gangs and the Yakuza...

335
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,260
There's Orihara Izaya.

336
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,110
Orihara Izaya?

337
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,270
That's a strange name.

338
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,760
You're one to talk.

339
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,310
Anyway, he's trouble, so don't get involved with him.

340
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,440
Well, he hangs around Shinjuku,

341
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,190
so I don't think you'll meet him any time soon.

342
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,570
Oh, and don't get involved with the Dollars.

343
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,720
Dollars?

344
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,410
Aye. Like the Dollars in "Wanderers."

345
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,160
"Wanderers"? What the...

346
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:52,460
I don't know much about them either,

347
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,560
but they have lots of crazy members. A shit load of 'em.

348
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,270
Apparently, they're part of a Color Gang,

349
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,780
but no one knows which color.

350
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,640
Maybe they've disbanded by now,

351
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,110
because there are so many cops around and they can't meet.

352
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,510
Yeah?

353
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,650
Hey! Are you okay?

354
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,650
Are you all right?

355
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,470
Um, I'm sorry.

356
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,770
Are you all right?

357
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,770
Uh...

358
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,170
Get away!

359
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,340
H-Hey!

360
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,340
What the hell?

361
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,080
She didn't even bother to thank me.

362
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,590
I wonder what happened to her?

363
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,000
Who knows?

364
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,700
Anything can happen in this bizarre city.

365
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,310
But hey, you're lucky.

366
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:56,100
You met Simon and Kadota-san and company.

367
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,370
You even saw Shizuo throwing a vending machine and people around.

368
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,980
And you bumped into that babe.

369
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,640
I wonder if that makes me lucky, though.

370
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,890
I'm really happy...

371
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,660
that I can go to school and hang out here with you.

372
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,050
Me too.

373
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,130
You're really lucky, dude!

374
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,140
The frickin' urban legend is right in front of you!

375
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,300
Kida-kun!

376
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,210
Oh, you saw that black bike, Tanaka Tarou-san?

377
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,530
Was it around nine?

378
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,840
Oh, you heard about that, Setton-san?

379
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,600
Uh, yeah. I was there too.

380
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,940
What's this urban legend?!

381
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,480
The black bike, dude!

382
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,530
The rider without a head!

383
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:52,280
At that moment I noticed that I was trembling.

384
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,410
Not from fear.

385
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:59,200
I think I was just... mesmerized.

386
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,970
I'd seen something amazing.

387
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:12,050
Here, in this town, I'd experienced something I'd never experienced at home.

388
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:20,150
I felt the reality that seemed out of my reach unfold in front of me.

389
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,650
It might sound like I'm contradicting myself,

390
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,020
but at least that's what I thought.

391
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:31,890
I was thrilled by the premonition that a new reality was starting.

392
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,660
Really?

393
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:40,370
Then we just missed each other.

394
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,960
Yeah.

395
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,590
By the way...

396
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,710
who's Dotachin?

397
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,220
The girl with an enigmatic past

398
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,720
takes a peek at a reality she has never seen.

399
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,270
A reality that anyone could encounter, but never does.

400
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:26,520
What did the girl who was supposed to be dead see?

401
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,110
Next time: Highly Unpredictable.
