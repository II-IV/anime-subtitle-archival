1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:00,590
{mumbling}

2
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,750
I'm starting to see more yellow people recently.

3
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,870
The Yellow Napkins?

4
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,290
Have you heard that The Slasher is actually the act of Dollars?

5
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,790
We're really not the same without you.

6
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,250
How's he doing?

7
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,170
He visits me from time to time.

8
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,170
He was just out there.

9
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,370
Tokyo's air is ugly.

10
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,800
Don't you agree?

11
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,530
Parasite! Parasite! Parasite!

12
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,750
Did you hear?

13
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,840
Some students from Raira Academy were just attacked by The Slasher.

14
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,800
Seriously?

15
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,640
That's scary.

16
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,680
I'm totally, frickin' serious.

17
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,180
Female freshmen, apparently.

18
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,210
Sorry.

19
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,850
I'm gonna idle while I make some calls.{ROM means Read Only Member}

20
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,510
Don't worry.

21
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,270
It wasn't your girlfriend.

22
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,020
Thanks.

23
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,070
But I'm still concerned.

24
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,300
Do you know where it happened?

25
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,480
Well,

26
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,630
it's just a little past Higashi Ikebukuro station, along the Metro Highway.{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuto_Expressway}

27
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,060
You won't have any problems finding it, since there are police cruisers and such there.

28
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,750
I see...

29
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,280
Sorry, I'm going AFK for a while.

30
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,510
Setton-san, are you going over there to gawk?

31
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,260
Aw, darn.

32
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,760
Sorry, I'm gonna sign off too.

33
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,010
Did you get a hold of her?

34
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,350
She said she's at the police station now...

35
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,890
I guess she witnessed it.

36
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,600
I'm gonna go.

37
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,620
Oh...

38
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,880
Then, me too.

39
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,420
The Slasher.

40
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:15,290
At that point, I was completely unaware that this bloody incident

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,430
had a strong tie to a girl's destiny, and to my past.

42
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,480
I'm home!

43
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,950
I'm home.

44
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,870
Hello, hello.

45
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,040
I'm home, Celty!

46
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,200
Welcome home, dear.

47
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,320
What's wrong?

48
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,020
I witnessed a horrifying sight.

49
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,500
A horrifying sight?

50
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,280
Don't make me say it!

51
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,480
I want to forget about it.

52
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,810
Man, that felt good.

53
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,460
You should at least take that white thing off when you're in the shower.

54
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,170
No.

55
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:29,380
Tokyo's air is dirty, so I can't ever take it off.

56
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,420
By the way, Celty-kun, thank you for last night.

57
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,280
Anyway, what's up with those rude guys wearing yellow?

58
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,590
That must be the Yellow Napkins.

59
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,820
They formed around the time you left for America.

60
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,970
I thought they were laying low after that fight with the Blue Squares.

61
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,770
They can all die in the sewer after fighting each other.

62
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,610
Stop asking the impossible.

63
00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:00,270
Anyway, Celty brought you home safely, so pay her.

64
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,250
I'll keep a tab with you.

65
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,030
I absolutely refuse.

66
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,490
Then I'll just ignore it.

67
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,910
I was just testing you, Celty-kun.

68
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,130
If you free me right now...

69
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,390
Ouch! Ouch!

70
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,570
It's poking me!

71
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,910
The tip of the shadow is poking me!

72
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,040
Shinra!

73
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,130
I'm in a real crisis!

74
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,700
I certainly expect my son to know how to act in such a situation!

75
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,000
Of course I do.

76
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,780
Thank you for your business.

77
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,930
I will not be leaving any inheritance to you.

78
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,620
I don't need any.

79
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,820
You've been tricked by that monster.

80
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,220
If Celty's tricked me and stolen my soul, that's what I really want anyway.

81
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,170
Oh?

82
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,330
Oh wow, wow, wow, what, Celty-kun?

83
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,300
Have you fallen in love with Shinra?

84
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,320
I knew my son was weird enough to develop feelings for you,

85
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,460
but now you love Shinra too?

86
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,740
Yes.

87
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,520
Celty!

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,270
It's great that you admit your feelings for me!

89
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,630
Our relationship used to be so vague and opaque,

90
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:29,650
but now we're super close to each other and ready to go public with the news!

91
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,160
This progress makes me want to jump up and down in joy!

92
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,130
You're embarrassing me!

93
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,200
Shut up already!

94
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,500
Now I'm overjoyed that I confessed my love to you.

95
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:43,070
Did you think I'd allow this relationship?

96
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,000
What?

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:52,030
Are you aware that you are an uninvited member of human society, better known as a "monster"?

98
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,180
Of course.

99
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,180
"Of course"? Wait...

100
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,960
What's wrong with that?

101
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,490
Seems like my plan to get control of the situation by pointing out my opponent's anti-social status failed.

102
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,690
That's not convincing at all, coming from you.

103
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,920
Besides...

104
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:14,850
Shinra told me that he likes me just the way I am now!

105
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,100
Fine, I'll allow this relationship.

106
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,140
But, from now on, you are...

107
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,960
to address me as "Father."

108
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,840
Shut up!

109
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,010
By the way, Celty-kun,

110
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,430
you can't regain your memories if you don't regain your head.

111
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,610
That is, the memories of your time as a Dullahan with a head in Ireland, your homeland.

112
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,060
That... can't be helped.

113
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:48,900
Let's make many new memories together to make up for your lost ones.

114
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,240
Shinra...

115
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,380
To start, let's have a wedding.

116
00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:00,450
I want to get your measurements for the wedding dress, so take off that shadow suit.

117
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:06,080
This reminds me: he's always been a strange kid. Always happy whenever there's a dissection.

118
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,300
It's clearly because of you!

119
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,590
Call me "Father"!

120
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:18,500
I told you not minutes ago.

121
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,550
How careless of you.

122
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,640
This is why you didn't even notice when I stole your head.

123
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,150
Oh crap!

124
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,900
Wh-Wh-Wh-What did you just say?

125
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,050
What do I do now?

126
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,930
I accidentally let slip a very important secret.

127
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,220
But it'll be okay.

128
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,050
Celty is a klutz, so you'll never catch on.

129
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,680
Klutzy Celty!

130
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,500
Shut up!
Klutzy Celty!

131
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,410
And don't repeat it!

132
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,460
I can easily predict the attacks of an angry klutz!

133
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,370
Even you won't get away if you make fun of Celty.

134
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,040
All right! All right!

135
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,240
I'll explain everything.

136
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,190
I guess there's no use hiding it anymore.

137
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:04,260
Yes, the one who stole your head and gave it to a pharmaceutical company was me!

138
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,510
Don't be shameless about it!

139
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,680
Fine.

140
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,030
Then come with me.

141
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,500
There's something I want to show you.

142
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,330
What? He ran away?!

143
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,680
That fucking bastard!

144
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,540
I won't let him!

145
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,210
Is she gone?

146
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,480
Looks like my trick of only pressing the elevator's button succeeded.

147
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,570
I'll come get my bags later.

148
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:50,480
See ya.

149
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,670
Damn it, where'd he go?

150
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,830
Celty-san.

151
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,740
Is something wrong?

152
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,380
You're totally spaced out.

153
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,350
I was thinking about things.

154
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,120
Tell me.

155
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,930
What's on your mind?

156
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,220
You look gloomy.

157
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,120
It's about The Slasher.

158
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,720
There's this strange rumor spreading on the Net.

159
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,210
Strange rumor?

160
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:35,430
Yeah, saying that The Slasher is the work of the Dollars.

161
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,360
No way.

162
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,840
Do you really believe that?

163
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,180
I don't, of course.

164
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:47,250
But if the rumor takes off, something dangerous might happen.

165
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:52,380
There's already a lot of tension between the Dollars and the Yellow Napkins.

166
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,380
It's true that the town's balance is fragile right now.

167
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:05,440
Mikado, I'll check around about The Slasher too.

168
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,930
Celty-san...

169
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,010
So get going.

170
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:13,740
People like you are easy targets if you space out in a place like this.

171
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,050
That's true.

172
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,350
Thank you.

173
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,330
The Slasher, huh...

174
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,410
Sorry, but I don't have a clue.

175
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,950
I see.

176
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:33,240
You don't have to go so far for the Dollars.

177
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,460
It's not just for the Dollars.

178
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,800
I have some history with her.

179
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,090
I'd be dead if I had a head.

180
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,380
You dumbass...

181
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:52,820
I know the one who says, "Dumbass," is the dumbass, but I'm fine being a dumbass, so I'll say it.

182
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,730
You dumbass!

183
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,160
You should've told me that first!

184
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,300
I'll kill her!

185
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,470
Totally kill her!

186
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,440
Surely kill her!

187
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,480
Fucking seriously kill her!

188
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,680
But you know, I'm a headless rider.

189
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,170
I'm totally fine.

190
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,560
Oh, no, no.

191
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,860
That's not the issue here anymore.

192
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,210
Attacking you deserves a million deaths.

193
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,700
Killkillkillkillkill...

194
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,970
What about work?
Killkillkillkillkill...

195
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,330
Aren't you on break right now?
Killkillkillkillkill...

196
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,030
I don't care.

197
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:22,490
I won't allow you to get fired on my account.

198
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:27,150
Besides, I need more information before I look for The Slasher.

199
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,830
I'll go get ready, so wait!

200
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,850
Fine.

201
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,690
But do it ASAP.

202
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,150
Killkillkillkillkillkill...{SATSUGAI, SATSUGAI SE YO...}

203
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,820
There was a reason I needed to be away from Shizuo.

204
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm so glad you came to see me.

205
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,100
By the way, did you find your head yet?

206
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,410
Forget about the head.

207
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,570
Let me get straight to the point.

208
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,720
I want info about The Slasher.

209
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,760
Three big ones will do.

210
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,840
So your clothes and wallet are both made of shadows.

211
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:21,220
So, if a really bright light shone on you, would you be buck naked?

212
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,860
Are you interested?

213
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,440
Nah.

214
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:32,370
Unlike the weirdo quack and student, I don't get aroused by the headless or a head.

215
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,060
I'm fine, but if you insult Shinra again, I won't forgive you.

216
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,460
You're so in love.

217
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:52,770
But if another Dullahan comes and tempts him, he might easily fall for her.

218
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,240
I want to believe that he wouldn't...

219
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,490
But even if that happens...

220
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,690
Would you kill Shinra, then kill yourself?

221
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,110
No.

222
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,690
I just won't let any other headless woman come near him.

223
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,210
Because I love him right now.

224
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,630
You've grown so similar to a human!

225
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,820
But you should be careful.

226
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:26,370
The closer you come to being human, the bigger the shock you'll get when you regain your head.

227
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,880
I'll worry about that after I get my head back.

228
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,190
Actually, I'm starting to think that I might not need the head.

229
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,550
Putting that topic aside,

230
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,890
tell me about The Slasher.

231
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,620
I paid you, so don't tell me you don't have anything.

232
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,230
Don't you worry.

233
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,570
I have some killer info that I haven't leaked to the police, media, or Internet yet.

234
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:51,390
I was actually waiting to tell you first.

235
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,820
Why?

236
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:57,590
Because this case involves supernatural evil spirits.

237
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,670
Have you heard about a sword named "Saika"?

238
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,830
"Saika"?

239
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:07,600
This might sound unbelievable, but Saika is a cursed sword that actually existed in Shinjuku.

240
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,150
A cursed sword?

241
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,180
Like Muramasa?

242
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,260
Yes, it's a sword with a mysterious power.

243
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,620
What's on your mind?

244
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,640
I heard a story about a cursed sword named Saika.

245
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,400
Apparently, there's a legend that says Saika has a mind of its own, and that it can take control of humans.

246
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:34,900
And each victim of The Slasher testified that The Slasher had red eyes.

247
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,180
And you think that's because of Saika?

248
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,030
Yes.

249
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:45,290
Every night there was a slasher incident, someone with the username "Saika" logged onto the Internet.

250
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,300
But when I got attacked by her before, I didn't notice her presence coming toward me.

251
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,390
If Saika isn't human, I would've sensed her presence.

252
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,670
Saika only takes over the mind of a person.

253
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,310
And that person is actually moving around.

254
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:08,210
So it's possible that there isn't a presence that you can detect.

255
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:12,070
You know a lot about Saika...

256
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,900
Oh, you know, you asked me to check on it before.

257
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,390
Anyway, come to bed soon.

258
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,830
That made me think that Shinra was hiding something from me...

259
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,220
Hey, welcome back!

260
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:44,570
Ever since Nebula took over Yagiri Pharmaceutical, I've been researching Miss Namie's whereabouts.

261
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,500
Then I found her frequenting your room.

262
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,050
So I threatened her with this toy gun to get in.

263
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,380
A toy gun?!

264
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,470
Didn't I tell you?

265
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,260
Shouldn't we turn this guy over to the police?

266
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:04,330
But wouldn't you be the one who gets in trouble?

267
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:10,110
If they search the way I tell them to, they'll find a young woman's head in the room!

268
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,650
You know, that might become the new headline that replaces The Slasher.

269
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,350
So Shinra's twisted character comes from you.

270
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,100
Praising me won't get you anything.

271
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,790
But seriously, I don't need to have the head right now.

272
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:34,610
My corporation is quite surprised from seeing Celty-kun's manner on TV.

273
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:40,700
So they came to the conclusion that they should study the body before the head.

274
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:46,210
So now I'm the one who's supposed to be searching for the head.

275
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:51,990
It seems you have a very interesting plan for the head.

276
00:17:51,990 --> 00:18:00,240
You assume that a Valkyrie is a Dullahan, and thus are trying to wake the head up by placing it within a conflict.

277
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,320
That's a very unique idea.

278
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,990
Well, I'm trying different things.

279
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:10,480
In the worst case scenario, I might have to take it somewhere that has an armed conflict.

280
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:15,490
I'd appreciate it if we can cooperate.

281
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,200
Very well.

282
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,700
I've had eyes on you for a while too.

283
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,640
There's no one around me who's willing to run an experiment based on a mythical legend.

284
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,750
Including me.

285
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,370
Thanks.

286
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,690
Now...

287
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,700
Let me give you some advice.

288
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:40,880
If you're trying to provoke Celty-kun's head or soul by causing a pseudo-conflict here in Tokyo,

289
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,970
don't get her involved in someone else's conflict.

290
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,970
Instead, getting everyone else involved...

291
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,940
in a disaster with her in the middle would be the way to go.

292
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,910
That's my intent.

293
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:01,450
Actually, things are progressing faster than I anticipated.

294
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,930
Anri!

295
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:09,930
You're able to help with the sports festival preparations already?

296
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:10,810
Y-Yes.

297
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,490
I was so worried about you.

298
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,940
Why were you with those slashed students?

299
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,300
Were they picking on you again?

300
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,250
I'm worried.

301
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,180
I'm very worried.

302
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,380
The Slasher might come after you again.

303
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,880
It's not safe to walk alone.

304
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,810
Harassing her again?

305
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,810
Tsk, tsk, Sensei.

306
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,790
I was concerned about Anri.

307
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,460
Wow, you call her by her given name.

308
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,820
How risqué!

309
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:43,370
If you pay too much attention to her, she might transfer schools like Niekawa-senpai.

310
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,820
You were her homeroom teacher last year, right?

311
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,760
Of Niekawa Haruna-san?

312
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,000
What's this?

313
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,290
Do you know Niekawa?

314
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,970
Yeah, but just her name.

315
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,550
Anyway, us students should leave.

316
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:03,490
Who is Niekawa Haruna-san?

317
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,490
Hey Anri,

318
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:09,930
Mikado hasn't confessed his love to you yet, has he?

319
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:10,590
What?

320
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,060
Just as I thought.

321
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,350
But you <i>are</i> aware that he's fallen head-over-heels for you, aren't you?

322
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,120
Ryugamine-kun is a good friend of mine, so...

323
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:24,310
It seems my best friend is seriously in love with you,

324
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:27,020
so I'll watch from the sidelines for now.

325
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:31,460
Besides, I need be on good terms with all the fair ladies of the world.

326
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,870
Masaomi!

327
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,120
Sonohara-san!

328
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,130
Here comes The Timid.

329
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,870
Sorry, did you wait long?

330
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,320
The wait was so long, I thought I was turning into a fossil.

331
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,900
Uh... Square root of three points.

332
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,660
"Square root"?

333
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,150
Why square root?

334
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:49,470
Give me an easier score to understand, like -20 points!

335
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,490
Bye!

336
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,970
See you tomorrow.

337
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,480
See you.

338
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,250
You finally came.

339
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,700
Celty.

340
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,750
It's about Saika.

341
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,930
My father owned it for a while.

342
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:38,430
But he sold it to an antique dealer a few years ago.

343
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,520
Shingen did?

344
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,020
For what?

345
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,780
Saika is known as a sword that cuts the soul.

346
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,320
Does that mean...

347
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,690
Yes.

348
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:52,570
He used Saika to steal your head.

349
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,680
To cut the soul that ties the head and the body.

350
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,110
And you've known about this the whole time?

351
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,100
Yes.

352
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,840
I learned later that he used it to steal your head.

353
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:12,080
I thought I could tell you this now, since you're trying to forget about your head.

354
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,680
But...

355
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,520
Let me think about this alone for a while.

356
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,340
Just as I thought.

00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,720
Love creates confusion.

358
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,910
That same night, the cursed sword Saika was trying to love a certain girl.

359
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:37,410
The girl who couldn't discover her place in this world.

360
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,670
Sonohara Anri.

361
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,180

362
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,180

00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:23,340
For the energy source of this town packed with junk.

364
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,570
For the truth behind the town of ever-increasing desire.
