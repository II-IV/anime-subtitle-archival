1
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,750
Dollars?

2
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,760
They're angels that fly in the sky, show their panties, and shout, "Pipiru Pirupiru."

3
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,300
Don't fuck up the dose, 'kay?

4
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,780
They'll pay less if she doesn't wake up.

5
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,800
We don't know that much about them either,

6
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,890
but we'll tell you everything we know.

7
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,890
Apparently, they're part of a color gang,

8
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,810
but no one knows which.

9
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,980
The new publication of Dengeki Bunko came out today,

10
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,270
...and ten... for other things.

11
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,570
Yep, for other things.

12
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,110
Don't think you can get away!

13
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,780
Right turn!

14
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,990
A man needs strong abdominal muscles.

15
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,250
This is the first time we've gone all out since we joined the Dollars, right, Kadota-san?

16
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,550
Stay in your seats.

17
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:37,390
The Dollars aren't angels that fly in the sky, show their panties, and shout, "Pipiru Pirupiru," right?

18
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,730
Dotachin!

19
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,260
Stop calling me that!

20
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,770
All right, we shook 'em off.

21
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,830
Are they insane?!

22
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,320
Shit!

23
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,660
Well then, start talking.

24
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,490
Let's hear about the human experiments you're helping with.

25
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,130
I'm Kadota Kyouhei.

26
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,140
I don't like to be called "Dotachin."

27
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,100
This adventure started eight hours ago.

28
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,150
I'll be talking about the infamous Kaztano incident.

29
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,960
The person who disappeared is one of my classmates.

30
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,570
Well, to be precise, a friend of a friend.

31
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,540
I've never met that person before.

32
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,960
So, someone you know went missing...

33
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,880
Oh, speaking of which, a lot of people have disappeared lately.

34
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,710
There are a lot of rumors about these incidents.

35
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,710
Kanra-san, you really like rumors, huh?

36
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,800
From what I've heard, it's either kids who ran away from home,

37
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,510
or illegal immigrants.

38
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:12,030
Basically, people who don't have any
impact on their surroundings.

39
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:21,900
Quite a few people fitting that profile seem to
disappear between Ikebukuro and Shibuya.

40
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,120
On top of that, when someone goes missing,
that person is never seen again.

41
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,790
Really?

42
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,190
Some rumors are even scarier.

43
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:37,880
The reason they're never seen again is because
the Dollars dispose of their bodies.

44
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,650
Nice, a rusty sign.

45
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,890
This is the place.

46
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,180
So this is where the informant said there'd be a good supply.

47
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,680
Yeah, this looks like a ghetto that illegal immigrants would live in.

48
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,690
All right, let's get in, get this stuff done, and then get some money.

49
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,050
Kaztano!

50
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,740
Kaztano!

51
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,920
Shut up!

52
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,320
Whoa! Teens!

53
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,570
Extra 20%, here we come!

54
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,530
Nah dude, let's play it safe this time.

55
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,030
If we don't, that <i>thing</i>  might come again. {extra space for aesthetics. -des}

56
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,280
The headless guy?

57
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,870
Let's just make do with that tonight.

58
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,910
'Sup?

59
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,270
Is he a beer short of a six pack or something?

60
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,920
Well, he <i>is</i> human.

61
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,960
So we should be prepared to get paid less for bringing in some geezer.

62
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,840
Hey.

63
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,140
Yo, my cash cow.

64
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,430
I'm Japanese! Just like you!

65
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,020
But many people say I act like a foreigner.

66
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,610
I'm <i>un poco </i>sad. {or a little sad}

67
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,610
I get bullied sometimes.

68
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,960
This geezer isn't even worth a cent.

69
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,480
Besides, what the hell does "<i>un poco</i> sad" mean?

70
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:55,470
So, if there isn't a brother-type fairy-helper character like Yuuta,

71
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,570
it's just like a maso with a hair fetish.

72
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,910
It's more of a trap than a brother-type character though.

73
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,450
I want a little sister-type chara that comes to help like a fairy.

74
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,740
But I wouldn't mind a big sis-type either.

75
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,550
Just don't talk about that during dinner.

76
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,690
Dotachin!

77
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,490
Let's go grab some dinner!

78
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,940
Dinner! Dinner!

79
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,600
Okay.

80
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,920
Man, your craftsmanship is as excellent as ever, Kadota-san.

81
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,710
This bathroom is bigger than my room.

82
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:27,000
They wanted it to feel like a high-class cabaret inviting you to relax.

83
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,040
Oh, we'd better hurry up.

84
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,390
Today's the important day that only comes once a month.

85
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,310
Yeah.

86
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,740
Who is it?

87
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,720
Kaztano.

88
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,520
"Bin is borked."

89
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,200
Then he should buy a new one.

90
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,810
He should go to a dollar store.

91
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,530
I am Japanese!

92
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,660
Maybe he meant "I've been abducted"?

93
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,240
You're thinking too much.

94
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,350
Shut the hell up!

95
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,250
Make him sleep already!

96
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,160
Aye!

97
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,800
It's cheap!

98
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,300
You heard the rumor too, Sonohara-san?

99
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,280
Yes.

100
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,750
Don't worry.

101
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,230
It's just a silly rumor.

102
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,140
Yeah.

103
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,040
Harima-san just disappeared.

104
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,200
That doesn't mean she was kidnapped.

105
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,400
It's unfathomable that she would be kidnapped and dispo—

106
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,530
Good job going into detail.

107
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,430
Did I just dig my own grave?

108
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,290
Here's your sushi.

109
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:41,070
No worries, our sushi is made of fish.

110
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,910
Even when they're half off, they're not made from humans.

111
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,920
But you know...

112
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,420
Shit, is he gonna continue?!

113
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,450
Simon!

114
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,540
The banner out front is broken.

115
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,670
The banner?

116
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,060
Yes!

117
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,140
Let's go and fix it.

118
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,530
Okay? Okay?

119
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:55,760
Let's go and get it fixed.

120
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,880
Really.
Let's go and get it fixed.

121
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:56,890
Let's go and get it fixed.

122
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,620
The sushi shop around the corner serves human meat on "50% Off" days.

123
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,920
Humans! Humans, I say!

124
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:02,950
Scary, isn't it?

125
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,130
Hey Togusa-san, why don't you decorate your car with anime charas? {ok the pun is terribly hard to explain. itasha = those cars with anime figures on it etc though itasha could mean italian car too - dont leave it as itasha}

126
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,510
They're awesome.

127
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,410
I'll kill you.

128
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,570
Well duh. Italian cars are expensive since they're foreign.

129
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,150
A Setouchi-style shrimp please!

130
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,780
I want yellow tail and white trevally!

131
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,450
That was dangerous!

132
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,660
Yeah.

133
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,860
Dude, why'd you empty the whole bottle?

134
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,380
You even got some on us.

135
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,290
I can't drive.

136
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,590
I'm too sleepy.

137
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:36,340
Don't fall asleep until we've delivered him.

138
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,110
Fuck, man!

139
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,350
M-My eyelids!

140
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,810
Watch where you're going!

141
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,200
Ah, 'scuse moi.

142
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
What?

143
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,030
This guy's the cause of everything.

144
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,130
We can rejuvenate ourselves by throwing him out.

145
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,570
What?

146
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,530
Kaztano! We've got your sushi.

147
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,510
We even got you another old bin from Russia Sushi.

148
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,040
What the hell?!

149
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,730
He wasn't saying, "Bin is borked," after all.

150
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,680
Yeah.

151
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,950
A porcelain bowl!

152
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,890
Dotachin.

153
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,390
Kanji conversion for dummies.

154
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,670
Kaztano...

155
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,560
He must have been kidnapped by those human hunters!

156
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,240
We'll never see him again!

157
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,960
What am I going to do without him?

158
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,620
Who's gonna support me now?!

159
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:55,050
We all knew how much Kaztano meant to Togusa.

160
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,950
No one can replace him.

161
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:01,270
Not even us three.

162
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,450
That kinda makes me feel lonely.

163
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,640
If he was being abducted when he sent that mail, it couldn't have been that long ago.

164
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,090
We've got to get him back before they deliver him to their client.

165
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,780
How?

166
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,440
I know!

167
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,410
I saw their car.

168
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:23,970
Hashim.

169
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:24,910
Yays!

170
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,450
The ultimate supporting fairy, "Little Brother Character"!

171
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,630
Okay, got it.

172
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:38,420
We just have to save the foreigner when we find them, right?

173
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,600
Yes.

174
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,590
We don't know where or when the exchange will take place.

175
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,260
But we want to free him as soon as possible.

176
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,710
Okay. A black van, right?

177
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,680
You have the license plate?

178
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,930
Yeah. Got something to write on?

179
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:51,930
Wait a moment.

180
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,720
Go on.

181
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,980
Thanks, Hashim.

182
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,780
No need.

183
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,210
Can you eat sushi?

184
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:00,910
Yes.

185
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,440
Bye.

186
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,020
Does it have wasabi?

187
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,740
Yes.

188
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,950
Don't worry. Russian wasabi isn't spicy.

189
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,910
Don't lie to him.

190
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:09,740
Let's go.

191
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,250
'Kay.

192
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,750
It's a black van. Here's the license plate number.

193
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,430
Be careful.

194
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,040
The perpetrators are just hired goons for some corrupt corporation.

195
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,350
Well, they're like peanuts.

196
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,440
Apparently, they kidnap people who go unnoticed in society and hand them over to their superiors.

197
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,800
I guess humans are used as raw materials for various things.

198
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,410
It's almost like cannibalism.

199
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,490
We haven't been getting much from the "subcontractors" this month.

200
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,730
Right.

201
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,030
We have been careful with the—

202
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,760
Spare me your excuses.

203
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,480
Dismiss the groups that can't supply enough.

204
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:58,710
But...

205
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,710
Or will you be the "raw material"?

206
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,670
You may leave.

207
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,690
Seiji.

208
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,450
Shinra, you idiot!

209
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,220
Spa~rkling...

210
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,130
Da~ncing...

211
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:45,380
We frantically searched for the black van that abducted Kaztano.

212
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,590
We were determined to save him.

213
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:54,510
We tried many things, but we still couldn't find his whereabouts.

214
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,890
A feeling of anxiety encompassed my heart.

215
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:03,120
Will we never hear that classic phrase from him again?

216
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,150
That nostalgic phrase I heard so many times as a kid.

217
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,910
That very phrase that I never thought I'd hear as an adult.

218
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,860
You need tickets?

219
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,910
I've got tickets!

220
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,780
Kaztano's kind isn't one you see much nowadays.

221
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:26,620
And Togusa relied on him for the greatest happiness in his life.

222
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,430
Togusa's eternal goddess, Hijiribe Ruri.

223
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,930
A goddess that Togusa worshipped, even though his love was one-sided.

224
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:44,440
Kaztano was his magician, so to speak, as he never failed to snag Togusa a hard-to-get stage-side seat to his goddess.

225
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,950
We have to save him for Togusa.

226
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,660
Dotachin, what are you talking about?

227
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,930
And who're you talking to?

228
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:56,950
Well...

229
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,540
I've been thinking...

230
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,040
Why don't we try calling his cellphone?

231
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,460
Maybe we can negotiate with them.

232
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,260
Sushi love.

233
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,940
I like fatty tuna.

234
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,450
Who the hell are you?

235
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,980
Oh my, if it isn't Dotachin.

236
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,310
You know,

237
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,630
I was just passing by and saw some guy sleeping.

238
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,420
So his cellphone rang and I—

239
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,490
What? Where I am?

240
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,220
I'm in front of Taishouken in South Ikebukuro.

241
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:35,990
Ya know...

242
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,980
Today, Russia Sushi is half off.

243
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,040
Izaya!

244
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,420
Don't ever come back to Ikebukuro!

245
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,900
Whoops, Shizu-chan found me.

246
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,650
See ya.

247
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,470
Izaya!

248
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,880
Wake up!

249
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,170
Hey! Wake up!

250
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,180
Hey! Wake up!

251
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,370
Wake up, dammit!

252
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,090
Don't do that.

253
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,960
You'll put him to eternal sleep.

254
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,400
But if we don't hurry, Kaztano will—

255
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,300
Yeah! When he's delivered, he'll be disposed of!

256
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,440
What are you going to do?

257
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,230
I'm going to make his friends tell me where the exchange will take place.

258
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,120
It's almost time for the exchange.

259
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,260
You better watch out. The higher-ups are coming.

260
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,640
Yeah.

261
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,950
I'm Japanese!

262
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,660
You guys should notice your mistake already!

263
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,360
You still keep saying that?

264
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,440
That means you're listed as Japanese in your family register.

265
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,100
Listen, that's the important part.

266
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,260
My family register burned in the air raid.

267
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,960
How old are you, for crying out loud?!

268
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,980
Yeah?

269
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,070
'Sup, it's me.

270
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,490
Oh, Kanazawa?

271
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,740
You awake?

272
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,130
Sorry, I'm coming over there.

273
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,290
Hold on, where was the meeting point?

274
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,540
Dude, I can't believe you.

275
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:11,400
We are so awesome!

276
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,910
We got it!

277
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,340
Wh-Who the hell are you guys?

278
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:21,060
We're the Dollars!

279
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,060
Dollar...

280
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,280
Plus "s"!

281
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,730
You better remember it!

282
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,670
I'm sleepy... So sleepy.

283
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,190
Let's go.

284
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,580
We joined the Dollars for a simple reason.

285
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:44,310
These three were hanging out with me before I noticed.

286
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,000
I have no idea what redeeming quality they saw in me.

287
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,500
Seriously, what a praiseworthy bunch.

288
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,780
One day, I got a text message.

289
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,660
"Do you want to join the Dollars?

290
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,750
There are no rules or restrictions.

291
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,240
You just need to say that you're a part of the Dollars."

292
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,130
A very weird invitation.

293
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:07,300
Rumors were spreading about how "different" the Dollars were before I got this text message.

294
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,310
At first, I thought it was a prank,

295
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,790
but when I agreed just to see how it'd turn out,

296
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,300
I received a URL and password the next day. {lol baccano}

297
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,780
When I logged in,

298
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,280
my nick was displayed on the Dollars' site.

299
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,770
None of the members, including me, have seen the leader before.

300
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,800
The Dollars is comprised of many smaller groups,

301
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,490
and they all form a hierarchic society.

302
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,770
However, the one on the throne is nowhere to be seen.

303
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:42,600
As long as there's no leader, I don't feel like I'm working under somebody.

304
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:48,520
But I cannot deny my curiosity about the person that created this organizational structure.

305
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,870
This is between us,

306
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:53,880
but there's a person that I think could be the leader.

307
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,030
That rude guy who started calling me "Dotachin."

308
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,430
Fatty tuna, yummy.

309
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,000
What you're looking for isn't that way.

310
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,340
Sorry, Selty.

311
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,890
How much do you think this guy will bring in?

312
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,300
Well, some beer money, I'd say.

313
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:26,010
Guess so.

314
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,300
Is that them?

315
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,190
Probably.

316
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,550
What the fuck?!

317
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,250
Kaztano!

318
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,420
Kaztano! I'll save you now!

319
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,520
You think it's gonna be that easy?

320
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,380
En garde!

321
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,150
Whoa, that's retro!

322
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,220
"En garde"?

323
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,150
Th-The headless one!

324
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,730
Even though we went for some geezer that won't net much money?!

325
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,150
Sorry! We are so sorry!

326
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,080
What the hell?

327
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:25,950
Kaztano!

328
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,660
Dotachino!

329
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,950
Ah, they're running away!

330
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:42,050
Don't think you can get away!

331
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,090
Right turn!

332
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,690
Can I go home now?

333
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:04,490
You better tell us who you were delivering him to.

334
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,620
No, no. Stop. It wouldn't be any fun if people talked without being tortured.

335
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,950
Please pick a book.

336
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,330
We'll torture you in accordance with the plot.

337
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:21,000
Hey, I don't care what you do, but don't use gasoline in the car like last time, got it?!

338
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,160
Togusano!
Gasoline?!

339
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,170
Gasoline?!

340
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,920
Let's perform the morning ritual!

341
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,160
I'll talk! I'll talk!

342
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,140
Please! Let me out!

343
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,770
Yagiri Pharmaceuticals, eh?

344
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,700
Pretty nice place, actually.

345
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,580
Do they really perform human experiments here?

346
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,960
We doubted it.

347
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,450
At least, that's what the exterior made us think.

348
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:00,060
But a coin has two sides.

349
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:05,360
There's a lot of darkness, especially in Ikebukuro.

350
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,150
Anyway, let's go grab something to eat.

351
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,230
Yeah.

352
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,020
Breakfast at Russia Sushi!

353
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,600
Sounds great! Let's go!

354
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,560
All right, it's settled.

355
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:20,390
Spend as much money as you want.

356
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,400
Thank you, sis.

357
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,730
Bye, Seiji.

358
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,370
Let's go.

359
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,980
Those are the details of the Kaztano incident.

360
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:45,060
Well, we're happy that our friend is back safe and sound.

361
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,010
Shut up.

362
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:16,640
You're annoying.

363
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,640
You're pissing me off.

364
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,810
I can't hold my rage any longer.

365
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,270
My body moves on its own.

366
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,730
I don't care what happens to me.

367
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,310
Next time: The Strongest.

368
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:30,340
But I hate violence!
