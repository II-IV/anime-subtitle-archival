1
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,300
I'm convinced that this development is a sign that Biribiri will become the heroine!{ep10, 19:19}

2
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,050
You're...

3
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:14,840
Help me!

4
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,050
What do you want from that "head" that's living as a human, as a whole entity?

5
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,850
I want to see her!

6
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,160
I believe it's from Yagiri Pharmaceuticals.

7
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,520
It's okay. Leave everything to me.

8
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,120
To be honest, I wasn't really sure...

9
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,670
I've gathered all the pieces.

10
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,140
I have to go.

11
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,060
I have to get her back.

12
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,330
My sister can't do it.

13
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,850
It has to be me...

14
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,300
It has to be me.

15
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,480
She wasn't there?

16
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,740
No.

17
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,600
According to the subcontractors, she was already gone by the time they arrived.

18
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,980
The student who's living there...

19
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,490
Ryuugamine, was it?

20
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,580
What about him?

21
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,300
They were going to question him when he returned,

22
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,820
and depending on the situation, bring him here,

23
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,170
but he had other people with him.

24
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,090
Why didn't they drag him here with his friends?

25
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,370
They're useless!

26
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,640
What should we do now?

27
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,840
Hello?

28
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,270
Are you Yagiri Namie-san?

29
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,490
Who are you?

30
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,150
I am Ryuugamine Mikado.

31
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,330
Would you like to make a deal?

32
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,700
I'm starving.

33
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,180
My~

34
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,940
Welcome! Welcome!

35
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,570
Russia Sushi is yummy!

36
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,690
It's cheap!

37
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,890
"What is life?"

38
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,960
"Why do people live?"

39
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,580
Someone pestered me with those questions, and I beat the crap out of him.

40
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,160
Right. {soudane}

41
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,910
I would've let it slide if it was some poetry-spouting brat still in school,

42
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,600
but a yakuza past his twenties asked me that. It's got to be a crime!

43
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,920
Right.

44
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,540
Hey Simon-san, you don't understand a thing I'm saying, do you?

45
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,490
Righto!

46
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,240
Have I changed...

47
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,520
in the past twenty years I've been in this city?

48
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,020
It wasn't for nothing!

49
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,320
Those twenty years you spent here weren't for nothing!

50
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,910
Nothing is pointless as long as you keep going.

51
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,830
"Keep going"?

52
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,660
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

53
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,160
For example...

54
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,260
Marrying me.

55
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,810
Shinra...

56
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,430
Are you Mikado-kun?

57
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,800
You're more timid than I imagined.

58
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,960
Or are kids like you even more dangerous?

59
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,480
So...

60
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,380
what was the deal you wanted to make?

61
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,620
I know where to find the person you're looking for.

62
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,360
Really?

63
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,800
How much do you want?

64
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,150
No.

65
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,730
I don't want any money.

66
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,930
Then what?

67
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,550
The truth.

68
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,030
What did you say?

69
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,800
I want you to acknowledge what your brother did to Harima Mika-san,

70
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,590
and what you did to Mika-san's body.

71
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,900
Unfortunately, I have only circumstantial evidence.

72
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,440
I'll cut to the chase:

73
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,950
turn yourself in.

74
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,650
Oh, I see.

75
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,870
So you're that kind of person.

76
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,450
I won't allow you to get in my brother's way.

77
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,850
That just won't happen.

78
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:33,660
No one is allowed to get in his way!

79
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,780
Aha... So she's that kind of a person.

80
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,960
Tell me.

81
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,860
Where's my sister?

82
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,050
I have to go.

83
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,720
That girl needs me.

84
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,520
I have to be by her side!

85
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,680
Hey!

86
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,680
Tell me!

87
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,730
That's the reason?

88
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,980
People died for that?

89
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,440
They even messed with her body. {maybe toyed is the wrong word.}

90
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,450
And went as far as trying to kill me.

91
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,380
You killed people because of that?

92
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,950
Will you destroy Yagiri-kun's happiness just to satisfy your ego?

93
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,570
What did you just say?

94
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,580
You're too young to venture into this twisted world.

95
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,870
Keep your damn mouth shut,
I'll be fine.

96
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,800
Keep your damn mouth shut,

97
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,180
if you're just going to get on your soapbox.

98
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,900
Yes, maybe I'm just being idealistic,

99
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,030
but so what?

100
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,660
You're the one who doesn't even understand the obvious:

101
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,600
that you should think about what you've done when you've killed someone!

102
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,470
Kid, you watch too much TV.

103
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,720
You're just babbling on about ideals and pre-established harmonies. {http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-established_harmony}

104
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,040
Wake up, boy. This is reality.

105
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,630
This isn't a movie.
I hope this works out.

106
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,320
This isn't a movie.

107
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,450
You're not some kind of hero.

108
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,550
Know your place!

109
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,050
What's wrong with that?!

110
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,960
I love pre-established harmonies, ideals,

111
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,950
rules, and even forced happy endings! {Mikado goes to rub-n-tugs}

112
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:26,000
What's wrong with desiring them?!

113
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,480
I'm not claiming that it's for the good of others or the world.

114
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,630
I just want to see it for myself.

115
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,490
I want to believe in that!

116
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,240
Yes... I will believe in that.

117
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,990
I will believe!

118
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,460
They all will...

119
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,670
I might be beating a dead horse,

120
00:08:53,670 --> 00:09:00,310
but that proves that people care about it!

121
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,930
Are you done?

122
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:22,330
I don't have the power and wisdom to make someone as ignorant as you to see reason.

123
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,060
You won't even give me a chance to prove myself.

124
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,790
That's why...

125
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,090
I'll rely on others!

126
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,370
What?!

127
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,380
Whoa!

128
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,520
Is all that because of the cellphones?!

129
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,900
Awesome!

130
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,270
This is like the supernatural phenomenon from "Missing"!

131
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,300
Young master, you've got mail.
This is like the supernatural phenomenon from "Missing"!

132
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,640
Young master, you've got mail.

133
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,580
Do you want to try dying once?
Young master, you've got mail.

134
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,130
Do you want to try dying once?

135
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,600
There it is!

136
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,550
Are you serious?

137
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,620
Well then...

138
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,720
Togusa, take care of the rest.

139
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,090
Okay.

140
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,830
Let's go.

141
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,630
How many people are there?!

142
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:47,350
Man, I never would've imagined that so many people would come to the first meeting.

143
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,890
So this is...

144
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,420
the Dollars?

145
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,950
Hey, Isaac! {zomg awesome}

146
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,870
Yeah, Miria?

147
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,500
Are they members of the Dollars too?

148
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,330
Precisely, Miria!

149
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,460
All right, listen up.

150
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:22,470
Now we're part of the group the kids talk about!

151
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,050
What the hell?!

152
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,470
Don't tell me they're all...

153
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,250
No way! You've got to be kidding me!

154
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,620
And! We just met for the first time like, today!

155
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,850
Wowzers!

156
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:39,450
Wowzers! Wowzers!

157
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,830
The sky in my hometown was vast.

158
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,800
However, there was nothing.

159
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,810
When I was a kid, this town was full of adventures.

160
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:05,680
I wonder when I started feeling like this.

161
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,100
I wanted to change something.

162
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,120
But I didn't have a reason or the courage.

163
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,600
It was around that time...

164
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,960
Uh... Double-click...

165
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,190
With a few clicks, a whole new realm opened its gates to me.

166
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:45,670
An arcane realm that I had been unaware of was within my reach.

167
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,540
I got back in touch with Kida-kun, who had moved to Tokyo.

168
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,440
I even made some new friends.

169
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,890
One night, I had an idea.

170
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,490
It started off as a joke though.

171
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,050
A gang?

172
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:07,740
Yes.

173
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,950
I hear that Tokyo has lots of gangs.

174
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,040
You're going to create an Internet gang?

175
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,210
No, no. I'll make people think it really exists.

176
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,740
Uh, I'll say they're based in Ikebukuro,

177
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,250
and spread that rumor on the Net.

178
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,780
We won't say we're in the Dollars.

179
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:31,670
We'll just start rumors and pretend we heard them from someone else,

180
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,150
and spread the name of the Dollars that way.

181
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,460
I even made a webpage for it,

182
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,350
and protected it with a password.

183
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,300
I leaked the password through email and BBSes.

184
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,800
I also pretended to be a member and made fake posts on BBSes.

185
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,800
Of course, most people didn't believe it.

186
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,780
Soon, there were people supporting us.

187
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:57,010
Everyone was having fun.

188
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,850
But I had a bad feeling.

189
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,010
People who called themselves "Dollars" started appearing.

190
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,890
That wasn't all.

191
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,350
Before I knew it, there were a lot of new members.

192
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,400
Even though we stopped giving the password out,

193
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,900
it seemed like someone on the inside was leaking it.

194
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,360
Guys, can you see this?

195
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,360
Hello?

196
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
Maybe they got scared.
Hello?

197
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:33,950
Maybe they got scared.

198
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,580
The people I created the Dollars with disappeared.

199
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,230
Even so, I didn't stop.

200
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,540
No, I couldn't stop.

201
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,800
I don't really know why.

202
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,150
That's not true!

203
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,340
There might be some bad people,

204
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,560
but they're not all jerks.

205
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:04,040
Why don't we turn it into a group of decent people?

206
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,860
Like doing good deeds to outweigh the bad things.

207
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,600
Like picking up trash,

208
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,330
or erasing graffiti.

209
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,060
The people were astonished.

210
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:33,590
This graffiti was definitely there last night,

211
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,340
but now, it's completely gone.

212
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:41,660
It's impossible to remove graffiti as large as this on your own.

213
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,730
Of course not...
It's impossible to remove graffiti as large as this on your own.

214
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,230
I came to Tokyo after Kida-kun invited me.

215
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:47,950
And there...

216
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:48,770
Dollars?

217
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,860
I don't know the details either,

218
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:56,870
but they have a lot of members scattered everywhere.

219
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,400
I heard they're one of the color gangs, but no one knows their color.

220
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,410
You know the deal with curiosity and the cat.

221
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:06,290
You shouldn't dig deeper.

222
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,320
But the Dollars are the strongest in the city, right?

223
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,130
So, what kind of gang are the Dollars?

224
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,090
Uh, if I had to describe it...

225
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,300
Colorless?

226
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,220
Dollars?

227
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,590
Yeah, I know them.

228
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,810
Well, I'm actually one of them.

229
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,600
I got a girlfriend after joining the Dollars!

230
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,600
They post crap on BBSes.

231
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,110
There's always someone who responds.

232
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:35,820
Well, once you're an old fart like me, you don't have any other social contact apart from work.

233
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,570
Ya know?

234
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:42,120
The Dollars saved someone who was about to be abducted by kidnappers!

235
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,620
Dollars forever!

236
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,350
So?

237
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,850
It's fun, so who cares?

238
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,820
This is more fun than I expected.

239
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,830
This is fun.

240
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,030
Huh? What?

241
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,490
What are these people doing?!

242
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,540
Hey, who's the founder of the Dollars?

243
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,210
Do you see an Arabian oil magnate?

244
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,170
Nope.

245
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:37,430
Togusa-san, the one who responded to us is the real founder, right?

246
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,340
Yeah... I think.

247
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,130
Togusa! The light!

248
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,100
It's red! Red!

249
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,840
Pretty talkative, aren't we?

250
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,170
Dotachin! Dotachin!

251
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,110
I told you to stop calling me that.

252
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,950
Someone replied on the Dollars' BBS.

253
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,790
I've made the arrangements.

254
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,510
You can meet her.

255
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:23,260
But in return, I want you to help me.

256
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,050
Celty.

257
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:12,800
He's gone!

258
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,690
Stop looking around like idiots!

259
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,150
Go find him!

260
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,010
Yes ma'am!

261
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:17,720
Move!

262
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,920
Where did he go?

263
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,050
Damn!

264
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:20,400
Move!

265
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,500
Enough is enough!

266
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,920
Who's talking?

267
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,920
I don't have a head!

268
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,920
I'm a monster!

269
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,680
I don't have a mouth to speak with, nor do I have eyes to show my passion!

270
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,040
I hear something.

271
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,930
Whose voice is this?

272
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,680
So what?

273
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,660
So what?!

274
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,810
Celty...

275
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,990
I'm here.

276
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,930
I do exist!

277
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,190
Who the hell are you?

278
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:25,730
If you say I don't have eyes, then behold carefully how I act! {Iunno.  I'll think of something later.}

279
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,620
Die!

280
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:33,530
Engrave the screams of those who enraged a monster into your mind!

281
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,260
Th-The Headless Rider!

282
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,270
It's the Headless Rider!

283
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,190
That?

284
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,580
The Headless Rider?!

285
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,240
I'm here.

286
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,360
I'm right here! I do exist!

287
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,140
I'm already screaming.

288
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,990
Screaming even louder!

289
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:20,020
I was born here,

290
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,780
in order to engrave my existence into this city!

291
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,410
Are you Ryuugamine Mikado?

292
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,120
Give...

293
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,100
Give Celty back!

294
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,180
That's right.

295
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,600
I've discovered a truth about this city.

296
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,640
Something so evanescent, something so normal.

297
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,440
I guess that boy...

298
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,820
Next time: Mutually Existing and Not.
