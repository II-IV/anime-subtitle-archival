Dialogue: 0,0:10:23.35,0:10:26.01,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,It's about the Slasher...
Dialogue: 0,0:10:26.01,0:10:29.62,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,There are some weird rumors on the Net and message boards...
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.62,0:10:31.22,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Weird rumors?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:31.22,0:10:35.29,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah, like the Slasher is part of the Dollars.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:35.29,0:10:36.28,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,That's absurd.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:36.66,0:10:38.82,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Do you believe that?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:38.82,0:10:41.55,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Of course I don't, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:10:41.55,0:10:47.16,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,But something dangerous will probably happen if the rumor gets around.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:47.16,0:10:52.57,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Especially since relations between the Dollars and \Nthe Yellow Scarves are strained enough as they are.

Dialogue: 0,0:13:04.96,0:13:06.72,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Three bills should do it.

Dialogue: 0,0:13:22.85,0:13:24.44,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Not really.

Dialogue: 0,0:13:46.13,0:13:52.78,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,What would happen if another dullahan came along, seduced him, and stole his heart...?
Dialogue: 0,0:13:52.78,0:13:55.26,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I'd like to think that wouldn't happen...
Dialogue: 0,0:13:55.26,0:13:56.46,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,But if it does, it does...
Dialogue: 0,0:13:56.46,0:13:58.65,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Would you kill Shinra yourself then?
Dialogue: 0,0:13:58.65,0:14:00.09,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,No...
Dialogue: 0,0:14:00.09,0:14:02.01,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I just wouldn't let him go near...

Dialogue: 0,0:14:21.53,0:14:26.35,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,The bigger the gap will be when you get your head back.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:26.35,0:14:29.84,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I'll think about that after I actually get my head back.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:30.22,0:14:35.04,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Well, to be honest, I've been thinking that I might not even need my head.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:35.04,0:14:38.91,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,More importantly, give me that information about the Slasher.

Dialogue: 0,0:14:51.34,0:14:52.78,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,What do you mean?
Dialogue: 0,0:14:53.87,0:14:57.54,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,This incident belongs in the realm of the fantastical.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:58.03,0:15:00.76,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Do you know of a katana called Saika?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:00.76,0:15:01.78,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,The Saika...?!
Dialogue: 0,0:15:01.78,0:15:07.62,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,It may be hard to believe, but Saika is an \Nethereal sword that used to reside in Shinjuku.

Dialogue: 0,0:15:09.02,0:15:11.12,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Like the Muramasa Blade?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:11.12,0:15:12.17,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:12.17,0:15:14.22,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,It's a katana with dubious magical powers.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:16.97,0:15:18.61,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,What's wrong?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:18.61,0:15:22.60,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I heard about some ethereal sword called Saika from Izaya.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:22.60,0:15:28.36,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,There's a legend that it has a mind of its own and takes control of humans.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:28.66,0:15:35.19,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Plus, every single one of the Slasher's victims says that it has red eyes.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:35.67,0:15:38.36,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,You're saying that's because of the Saika?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:38.36,0:15:39.00,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:39.58,0:15:45.33,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,The night the Slasher first appeared, someone with the handle "Saika" logged onto the network I use.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:46.87,0:15:52.26,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,But when I was attacked, I didn't notice it approaching.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:52.78,0:15:57.97,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I should be able to sense something if Saika isn't human.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:57.97,0:16:03.27,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,That would be because the Saika can only control one's mind, while the person's body is the thing that's actually moving.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:03.92,0:16:08.27,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Then it's understandable why you couldn't sense any type of presence.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:08.27,0:16:11.78,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Shinra, you seem pretty knowledgeable about Saika...
Dialogue: 0,0:16:11.78,0:16:15.85,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I mean, you told me to look into it before, didn't you?
Dialogue: 0,0:16:15.85,0:16:18.67,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Now, come to bed quickly.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:21.54,0:16:26.29,Thought,,0000,0000,0000,,{\fad(0,1320)}I thought, "Shinra's hiding something."

Dialogue: 0,0:17:11.73,0:17:15.56,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,This might become a first-rate scandal to take the place of the Slasher.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:15.56,0:17:20.24,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,So...Shinra does get his twisted personality from you after all.
