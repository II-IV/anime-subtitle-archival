Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.78,0:01:57.39,Thought,,0000,0000,0000,,I think.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.39,0:02:01.01,Thought,,0000,0000,0000,,Even if he didn't say it, I'm sure someone said something like it.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.69,0:02:22.37,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,So, what does the head of the Gold Bandannas want with us?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.37,0:02:27.32,Thought,,0000,0000,0000,,For us, the world of fiction is a playground \Nthat's just as important as reality.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.32,0:02:32.90,Thought,,0000,0000,0000,,Fiction and reality are equally valuable, so it's not like we hate reality.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.90,0:02:38.99,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,You'd understand if he said that he wants to talk with the Dollars, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.47,0:02:40.81,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Fine, then.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.81,0:02:47.26,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I'll say this in advance, but we don't know much and the Slasher's attacked our members, too.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.09,0:02:57.38,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Drink tea?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.38,0:02:58.98,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Catechin is good.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.85,0:03:01.45,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Hot!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.79,0:03:03.66,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,It's okay, boss.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.66,0:03:07.34,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,If you clear your mind of all worldly thoughts, even flames feel cool.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.34,0:03:08.97,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Don't angry.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.97,0:03:10.28,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,It's WEEEALLY hot.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.28,0:03:13.78,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I bet you really do know how to speak Japanese.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.78,0:03:17.36,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Anyway, it's crazy that you can hold on to those hot tea mugs.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.61,0:03:24.47,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,You might be the only ones thinking that.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.87,0:03:26.02,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.02,0:03:29.98,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,The Dollars have neither a vertical nor horizontal hierarchy, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.27,0:03:36.01,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,So there might be a secret faction that you don't know about.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.01,0:03:39.53,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,And if they slash their own members, no one will suspect them.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.50,0:03:41.73,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I see.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.73,0:03:43.97,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Well, I guess that makes sense.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.97,0:03:46.68,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,And? What's their motive?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.68,0:03:55.51,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,What's the point in destroying the Gold Bandannas by posing as the\N Slasher if they aren't motivated by greed or making a name for themselves.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.51,0:03:59.83,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,If I knew that, then there wouldn't be any\N problem and we could assume it's just a grudge.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.83,0:04:01.07,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,A grudge?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.07,0:04:04.82,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I haven't heard of any fights between\N the Gold Bandannas and the Dollars.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.82,0:04:07.35,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Not with the Dollars.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.26,0:04:10.31,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,The Blue Squares...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.77,0:04:12.35,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Kida...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.78,0:04:18.52,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I haven't forgotten what they did to us, and \Neven though that incident was basically settled,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.52,0:04:20.65,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,that doesn't mean my hatred for them has vanished.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.08,0:04:22.92,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,That's what I think.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.92,0:04:24.86,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,So that's why you've come to us?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.21,0:04:28.19,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Hey, you understand, don't you, Kadota?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.19,0:04:30.74,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I want you to tell me the name of the Dollars' boss.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.74,0:04:37.21,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,If possible, I'd get some of your old friends—guys from the Blue Squares who're in the Dollars—
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.51,0:04:40.31,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Don't, Kida.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.31,0:04:43.81,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Don't go mixing fantasy with reality like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.81,0:04:44.69,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.69,0:04:48.02,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,The Blue Squares never existed.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.02,0:04:50.00,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Let's leave it at that.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.36,0:04:55.49,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,You're—You're saying that Saki was attacked by \Na group that never existed, leaving her hospitalized—
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.39,0:05:00.19,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,That's right.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.75,0:05:03.90,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Your ex-girlfriend was attacked by a group that didn't exist.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.36,0:05:05.61,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,That's good enough.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.61,0:05:08.37,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Karisawa, you're about to make me angry!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.37,0:05:10.37,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,You already are angry, aren't you?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.37,0:05:13.37,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Besides, Yuma-chi got angry before you did.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.37,0:05:14.83,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,So you're even.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.83,0:05:18.10,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Just like how you're angry about what happened to your girlfriend,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.10,0:05:23.16,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,some people are angry that others say \Nthe Slasher is colluding with the Dollars.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.16,0:05:29.43,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,If you don't think we're all even based on that, \Nthen you shouldn't have brought up this topic.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.64,0:05:35.58,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,It's true that we have some debts to pay.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.58,0:05:42.50,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,If you, who ran away—unlike Dotachin,\N who saved Saki—want to bring up the past again,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.50,0:05:47.40,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,we're going to dispel that past form this world\N by saying it was a product of our imaginations.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.40,0:05:52.58,Thought,,0000,0000,0000,,If reality is as equally valuable as fiction, then you should just\N chalk up the parts of the past you don't need to your imagination.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.58,0:05:54.96,Thought,,0000,0000,0000,,That's how we do things.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.46,0:05:57.53,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,You're wrong, Karisawa.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.53,0:05:58.62,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,What? I am?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.62,0:06:06.73,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Assuming that the Blue squares did exist,\N they're the ones who were attacked first.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.73,0:06:11.26,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,And yet, they were just protesting against\N being unfairly labeled as the bad guys.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.64,0:06:14.11,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Oh, yeah!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.11,0:06:15.59,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm so embarrassed!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.59,0:06:18.10,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm so totally embarrassed!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.10,0:06:21.01,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm...sorry.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.01,0:06:24.46,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,No, we're also to blame.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.46,0:06:27.78,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,We truly regret the whole Saki incident.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.26,0:06:32.80,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,No, I should be thanking you for what you did back there.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.80,0:06:35.93,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,We'd understand even if you did hate us...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.93,0:06:40.84,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,...since we did all that to a mere middle schooler.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.84,0:06:43.70,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,But you didn't do anything wrong, Kadota...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.70,0:06:47.71,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,No matter how much you want to,\N you can't erase the fact that you had a part in it.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.65,0:06:55.93,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Anyway, I'll be up-front about this: I don't know who our boss is, nor do I have any intentions of finding that out.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.93,0:06:57.88,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Also, I'll say it again.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.88,0:07:02.73,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,The Slasher has nothing to do with the Dollars, and we\N have no reason to start a fight with the Gold Bandannas.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.73,0:07:04.30,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I understand.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.30,0:07:09.40,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Come to think of it, there is one guy who knows our boss.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.40,0:07:10.77,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Who is it?!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.77,0:07:11.88,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Hold on!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.88,0:07:14.56,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,What's the point of asking him?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.56,0:07:20.85,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Supposing that you find out our boss's name from that guy, do you plan on having a leisurely talk over some tea?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.85,0:07:23.98,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Or maybe you'll have some Gold Bandanna members kidnap him?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.98,0:07:26.63,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm just after the Slasher.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.93,0:07:29.99,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Is that the consensus of all the Gold Bandannas?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.99,0:07:31.13,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:31.13,0:07:36.71,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I'll cooperate as long as I know that you can keep your subordinates in line like in the old days.
