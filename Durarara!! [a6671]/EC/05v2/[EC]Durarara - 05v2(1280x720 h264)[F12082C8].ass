Dialogue: 0,0:12:17.42,0:12:25.21,Durarara Dialog Text,Mikado,0000,0000,0000,,I think it's more dishonest to come out and say that to people. It looks like you just want someone to forgive you for it.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:26.08,0:12:33.42,Durarara Dialog Text,Mikado,0000,0000,0000,,Striving to be better than Mika was the right choice. So why not puff out your chest and do so openly?
