00:08:35.082 --> 00:08:37.184
MIKADO...

00:08:37.184 --> 00:08:38.653
OR IF THEY KIDNAPPED ANRI JUST

00:08:38.653 --> 00:08:41.056
TO LURE HIM OUT...

00:08:41.056 --> 00:08:41.757
[heavy footsteps]

00:08:41.757 --> 00:08:43.124
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:08:43.124 --> 00:08:46.695
WHY DID I FREEZE UP BACK THEN?

00:08:46.695 --> 00:08:50.732
WHAT MADE ME STOP?

00:08:50.732 --> 00:08:53.703
WHAT WAS I AFRAID OF?

00:08:53.703 --> 00:08:55.372
&gt;&gt; THERE’S JUST NO ESCAPING IT.

00:08:55.372 --> 00:08:57.006
YOU CAN RUN FROM IT ALL YOU

00:08:57.006 --> 00:08:58.175
WANT, BUT YOUR PAST WILL ALWAYS

00:08:58.175 --> 00:08:59.142
FOLLOW YOU.

00:08:59.142 --> 00:09:03.113
[clattering]

00:09:03.113 --> 00:09:08.152
&gt;&gt; [grunting]

00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:14.058
&gt;&gt; THERE’S NO WAY.

00:09:14.058 --> 00:09:16.361
YOU’RE WRONG.

00:09:16.361 --> 00:09:18.063
&gt;&gt; IT’S ALL TRUE.

00:09:18.063 --> 00:09:19.031
&gt;&gt; SO THEN...

00:09:19.031 --> 00:09:20.132
DOES THIS MEAN MASAOMI KNOWS THE

00:09:20.132 --> 00:09:21.967
TRUTH ABOUT ME?

00:09:21.967 --> 00:09:23.135
&gt;&gt; I DON’T KNOW.

00:09:23.135 --> 00:09:24.904
BUT WHEN HE WAS SCREAMING AT

00:09:24.904 --> 00:09:26.306
ANRI, HE WAS OBVIOUSLY

00:09:26.306 --> 00:09:28.742
RATTLED ABOUT SOMETHING.

00:09:28.742 --> 00:09:30.010
IT’S POSSIBLE HE DID FIND OUT

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:31.111
THAT YOU’RE THE ONE WHO STARTED

00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:33.214
THE DOLLARS.

00:09:33.214 --> 00:09:34.681
&gt;&gt; BUT HOW?

00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:36.918
WHO WOULD’VE TOLD HIM THAT?

00:09:36.918 --> 00:09:37.985
&gt;&gt; THERE’S AN INFORMATION BROKER

00:09:37.985 --> 00:09:39.053
I KNOW WHO SEEMS TO LOVE PUTTING

00:09:39.053 --> 00:09:40.154
PEOPLE IN THESE KINDS OF

00:09:40.154 --> 00:09:42.223
PREDICAMENTS.

00:09:42.223 --> 00:09:44.059
&gt;&gt; [gasps]

00:09:44.059 --> 00:09:45.127
&gt;&gt; THE DOLLARS ARE YOURS.

00:09:45.127 --> 00:09:46.294
YOU STARTED IT.

00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:48.030
DO AS YOU WISH WITH IT.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.665
BUT I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT

00:09:49.665 --> 00:09:50.733
MAKING THEM DISAPPEAR ISN’T

00:09:50.733 --> 00:09:52.167
GOING TO HELP THE THREE OF YOU

00:09:52.167 --> 00:09:55.104
AT ALL.

00:09:55.104 --> 00:09:56.372
&gt;&gt; I DON’T GET IT.

00:09:56.372 --> 00:09:57.741
WHY DID NEITHER OF THEM JUST

00:09:57.741 --> 00:10:01.144
TELL ME?

00:10:01.144 --> 00:10:03.313
&gt;&gt; WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL THEM?

00:10:03.313 --> 00:10:04.414
&gt;&gt; I GUESS...I JUST FIGURED

00:10:04.414 --> 00:10:05.715
THAT...THE DOLLARS WERE MY

00:10:05.715 --> 00:10:09.019
PROBLEM.

00:10:09.019 --> 00:10:12.390
&gt;&gt; THEY FELT THE SAME.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.691
LOOK, WHAT YOU SEE ISN’T ALWAYS

00:10:13.691 --> 00:10:16.061
WHAT’S REAL.

00:10:16.061 --> 00:10:17.128
EVERYONE HAS SECRETS, THINGS

00:10:17.128 --> 00:10:18.397
THEY FEEL THAT THEY CAN’T TELL

00:10:18.397 --> 00:10:20.232
OTHERS.

00:10:20.232 --> 00:10:21.700
THERE’S NO SUCH THING AS A

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.069
NORMAL PERSON.

00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:24.436
DON’T BE AFRAID.

00:10:24.436 --> 00:10:25.838
JUST GO OUT THERE

00:10:25.838 --> 00:10:27.406
AND FACE MASAOMI, ANRI,

00:10:27.406 --> 00:10:31.010
AND YOUR OWN PROBLEMS HEAD ON.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.245
IF YOU LOVE HER, TELL HER THE

00:10:32.245 --> 00:10:33.180
TRUTH.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.748
TELL HER EVERYTHING.

00:10:34.748 --> 00:10:36.016
THIS ISN’T A PROBLEM FOR THE

00:10:36.016 --> 00:10:37.117
SLASHER, THE DOLLARS, OR THE

00:10:37.117 --> 00:10:38.218
YELLOW SCARVES.

00:10:38.218 --> 00:10:40.088
THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR THE THREE

00:10:40.088 --> 00:10:42.123
OF YOU TO SOLVE!

00:10:42.123 --> 00:10:44.926
[phone rings]

00:10:44.926 --> 00:10:45.994
&gt;&gt; HEY, CELTY, I’M RUNNING AFTER

00:10:45.994 --> 00:10:48.129
HER NOW, BUT...

00:10:48.129 --> 00:10:49.231
[panting]

00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:51.200
SHIZUO’S BEEN SHOT SEVERAL TIMES

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.467
AND ANRI RAN OUT OF THE

00:10:52.467 --> 00:10:53.368
APARTMENT AS SOON AS SHE FOUND

00:10:53.368 --> 00:10:54.203
OUT.

00:10:54.203 --> 00:10:55.270
WELL, I MEAN, THAT ISN’T WHY SHE

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:56.372
LEFT.

00:10:56.372 --> 00:10:58.241
IT SEEMS THAT THE ORDER TO

00:10:58.241 --> 00:10:59.875
HIT SHIZUO CAME FROM MASAOMI

00:10:59.875 --> 00:11:01.244
KIDA.

00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:02.245
I CAN’T KEEP UP.

00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:03.079
I’M OUT OF BREATH.

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:03.947
SORRY, THIS CONVERSATION

00:11:03.947 --> 00:11:06.082
IS ALL OVER THE PLACE.

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:07.918
A-ANRI’S JUST SO FAST.

00:11:07.918 --> 00:11:09.020
SHE’S TOO FAST!

&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.801
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS WRONG?

00:11:22.801 --> 00:11:24.903
YOUR FACE WEAR DEPRESSION.

00:11:24.903 --> 00:11:26.772
IS IT BECAUSE YOU BE HUNGRY?

00:11:26.772 --> 00:11:28.274
&gt;&gt; SIMON.

00:11:28.274 --> 00:11:30.209

&gt;&gt; HEY, SIMON.

00:11:33.179 --> 00:11:35.849
I GIVE YOUR SUSHI FIVE STARS.

00:11:35.849 --> 00:11:37.117
HECK, IF I COULD, I’D GIVE YOUR

00:11:37.117 --> 00:11:38.185
SUSHI A WHOLE GALAXY WORTH OF

00:11:38.185 --> 00:11:40.087
STARS.

00:11:40.087 --> 00:11:41.188
RUSSIA SUSHI WILL ALWAYS HAVE A

00:11:41.188 --> 00:11:43.223

&gt;&gt; DO YOU RUN NOW BECAUSE YOU GO

00:11:44.292 --> 00:11:45.393

00:11:45.393 --> 00:11:47.195
AND ARE YOU GOING NOW TO KILL

00:11:47.195 --> 00:11:50.065
OR BE KILLED YOURSELF?

00:11:50.065 --> 00:11:51.266
&gt;&gt; W-WHAT DO YA MEAN?

00:11:51.266 --> 00:11:52.167
WHY WOULD YOU SUDDENLY SAY

00:11:52.167 --> 00:11:53.134
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

00:11:53.134 --> 00:11:55.204

00:11:55.204 --> 00:11:56.272
&gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED?

00:11:56.272 --> 00:11:59.375
DID IZAYA START SOMETHING AGAIN?

00:11:59.375 --> 00:12:01.210
&gt;&gt; THAT’S NOT IT AT ALL.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:02.312
&gt;&gt; KILL OR BE KILLED.

00:12:02.312 --> 00:12:04.214
BOTH VERY BAD.

00:12:54.036 --> 00:12:55.170
THERE’S NO ONE.

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.039
NO ONE’S HERE.

00:12:57.039 --> 00:13:02.078
WHICH MEANS...

00:13:11.621 --> 00:13:13.590
&gt;&gt; INTERESTING.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.893
VERY INTERESTING.

00:13:15.893 --> 00:13:16.961
THREE BOSOM BUDDIES EACH

00:13:16.961 --> 00:13:18.996
PROTECTING THEIR OWN SECRET.

00:13:18.996 --> 00:13:20.265
AND NOW WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM

00:13:20.265 --> 00:13:21.366
SERENDIPITY AND JUST A FEW EVIL

00:13:21.366 --> 00:13:23.368
DEEDS, ALL OF THEM

00:13:23.368 --> 00:13:24.435
WILL SOON DISCOVER THE TRUTH

00:13:24.435 --> 00:13:25.203
ABOUT THEIR FRIENDS IN

00:13:25.203 --> 00:13:27.339
AN ALMOST IDEAL WAY.

00:13:27.339 --> 00:13:28.440
GRANTED, THE EVIL DEEDS WERE ALL

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.210
MY DOING.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.979
BUT WHAT CHOICE DID I HAVE?

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:34.246
AFTER ALL, THE PAWN I PLACED AS

00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:36.449
A MIDDLEMAN WAS A BORING LOSER.

00:13:36.449 --> 00:13:38.551
I HAD TO SPICE IT UP A BIT.

00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:39.652
PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.288
SOMEONE ELSE FOR THAT ROLE.

00:13:41.288 --> 00:13:44.458
NAMIE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:13:44.458 --> 00:13:49.430
[chuckles]

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:50.498
&gt;&gt; DON’T YOU ALL EXPECT A BIT

00:13:50.498 --> 00:13:52.400
MORE FROM THE YELLOW SCARVES?

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.367
COME ON!

00:13:53.367 --> 00:13:54.936
WE’RE NOT LIKE THE DOLLARS,

JUST A BUNCH OF RANDOM KIDS

HOOKING UP ON THE INTERNET.

00:13:57.706 --> 00:13:59.174
WE’VE GOT A UNIFIED POWER THAT

00:13:59.174 --> 00:14:00.442
THEY DON’T.

00:14:00.442 --> 00:14:01.711
I KNOW THE LEADER OF THE DOLLARS

00:14:01.711 --> 00:14:03.012

00:14:05.548 --> 00:14:07.017
THAT IS OBVIOUSLY SOME SORT OF A

00:14:07.017 --> 00:14:08.284
TRAP.

00:14:08.284 --> 00:14:09.385
LET’S GET THOSE GUYS BEFORE THEY

ALL OF TOKYO AS WELL!

00:14:18.262 --> 00:14:19.363
THINK ABOUT IT.

00:14:19.363 --> 00:14:20.665
IMAGINE WHAT WE COULD DO.

00:14:20.665 --> 00:14:22.133
NOT JUST THIS AREA HERE, BUT

00:14:22.133 --> 00:14:23.401
EVERY GANG IN THIS WHOLE DAMN

00:14:23.401 --> 00:14:24.502

KADOTA’S GANG.

00:14:33.379 --> 00:14:34.447
SO NEXT WE CRUSH THEM, THEN HIT

00:14:34.447 --> 00:14:35.514
THEIR LEADER, RYUGAMINE, THEN

00:14:35.514 --> 00:14:36.983
THE ONLY THING OUT THERE FOR

00:14:36.983 --> 00:14:40.420

GOOD IDEA, GUNNING HIM DOWN LIKE

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:54.302

WITH SHIZUO HEIWAJIMA GONE NOW,

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.442
WE GOT NOTHING TO BE SCARED OF

00:15:00.442 --> 00:15:01.109
ANYMORE.

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:02.144
&gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT IF THE POLICE FIND

00:15:02.144 --> 00:15:03.012
OUT, THEY’LL DESTROY US.

00:15:03.012 --> 00:15:04.046
&gt;&gt; THEN WE’LL JUST MAKE IT LOOK

00:15:04.046 --> 00:15:05.147
LIKE IT WAS THE DOLLARS FIGHTING

00:15:05.147 --> 00:15:06.616
AMONGST THEMSELVES.

00:15:06.616 --> 00:15:07.750
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.251
THAT’S CRAZY, THAT WON’T WORK!

00:15:09.251 --> 00:15:10.152
&gt;&gt; STOP YOUR WHININ’.

00:15:10.152 --> 00:15:11.621
OF COURSE IT’LL WORK.

I JUST SAID SO!

00:15:13.556 --> 00:15:14.524
&gt;&gt; HORADA...

00:15:14.524 --> 00:15:15.659
&gt;&gt; I’M TELLIN’ YA, IT’S GONNA

00:15:15.659 --> 00:15:16.727
WORK.

00:15:16.727 --> 00:15:18.228
IT HAS TO WORK.

00:15:18.228 --> 00:15:20.531
[laughs]

00:15:20.531 --> 00:15:24.769
[gasping]

00:15:24.769 --> 00:15:26.037
THAT THE COPS?

00:15:26.037 --> 00:15:27.305

00:15:32.544 --> 00:15:34.146
EH?

00:15:39.219 --> 00:15:40.520
WHAT THE HELL?

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.388
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

00:15:42.388 --> 00:15:45.592
[phantom neighing]

00:15:54.335 --> 00:15:56.237
&gt;&gt; WELL, HELLO, CELTY.

00:15:56.237 --> 00:15:58.173
YOU WANT SUSHI AGAIN?

00:15:58.173 --> 00:15:59.241
&gt;&gt; I’M LOOKING FOR MASAOMI KIDA

00:15:59.241 --> 00:16:01.243
AND ANRI SONOHARA.

00:16:01.243 --> 00:16:03.078
HAVE YOU SEEN THEM?

00:16:03.078 --> 00:16:05.348
&gt;&gt; DA, KIDA I DID SEE.

00:16:05.348 --> 00:16:06.582
THE FACE HE WORE WAS A VERY

00:16:06.582 --> 00:16:08.417
SERIOUS FACE.

00:16:08.417 --> 00:16:10.219
FACE FOR FIGHT.

00:16:10.219 --> 00:16:12.789
I TRY, BUT HE NO STOP.

00:16:12.789 --> 00:16:14.223
&gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE WAS

00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:14.691

00:16:14.691 --> 00:16:16.226
&gt;&gt; I’VE BEEN AROUND ALL DAY AND

00:16:16.226 --> 00:16:18.195
SEE NO GUYS WITH YELLOW.

00:16:18.195 --> 00:16:19.629
I THINK MOST LIKELY HE BE WITH

00:16:19.629 --> 00:16:21.531
THEM.

00:16:21.531 --> 00:16:24.569
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

00:16:38.617 --> 00:16:39.719

00:16:44.191 --> 00:16:48.696
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:16:48.696 --> 00:16:51.264
&gt;&gt; WHAT’S GOING ON HERE?

00:16:51.264 --> 00:16:52.366
I DON’T EVEN RECOGNIZE MOST OF

00:16:52.366 --> 00:16:54.468
YOU.

00:16:54.468 --> 00:16:56.704
NO ONE’S TAKING MY CALLS.

00:16:56.704 --> 00:16:58.306
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

00:16:58.306 --> 00:16:59.473
&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU SEE...

00:16:59.473 --> 00:17:00.842
ALL THE GUYS WHO SEEMED TO BE

AGAINST ME TAKING THE REINS FROM

00:17:02.277 --> 00:17:04.379
YOU WERE MYSTERIOUSLY AMBUSHED

00:17:04.379 --> 00:17:06.181
LAST NIGHT BY SOME GANG AND ARE

00:17:06.181 --> 00:17:07.316
STILL RECOVERING.

00:17:07.316 --> 00:17:08.350
OH, MY GOODNESS.

00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:09.785
IT WAS SO SCARY!

00:17:09.785 --> 00:17:10.853
IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE DOLLARS

00:17:10.853 --> 00:17:11.587
WHO DID IT.

00:17:11.587 --> 00:17:13.323
THAT’S HOW IT WENT, RIGHT, GUYS?

00:17:13.323 --> 00:17:16.292
[laughter]

00:17:16.292 --> 00:17:17.393
&gt;&gt; YOU SON OF A--

00:17:17.393 --> 00:17:19.396
&gt;&gt; HA! YOU’RE AN IDIOT.

00:17:19.396 --> 00:17:20.297
WHY’D YOU EVEN COME HERE

00:17:20.297 --> 00:17:21.332
TONIGHT?

00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:21.798
LOOK AT YOU!

00:17:21.798 --> 00:17:22.766
YOU’RE PATHETIC.

00:17:22.766 --> 00:17:23.901
YOU’RE LIKE A FREAKIN’ MOTH

00:17:23.901 --> 00:17:25.436
BEING DRAWN TO THE FLAME.

00:17:25.436 --> 00:17:26.704
MAYBE I SHOULD PLAY THE SAME

00:17:26.704 --> 00:17:28.840
GAME WITH YOU THAT IZUMII DID.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.475
SNAP ONE OF YOUR LITTLE LEGS IN

00:17:30.475 --> 00:17:31.676
HALF AND BE ALL LIKE,

00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:34.346
"HEY, IT’S POP QUIZ TIME."

00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:36.181
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID YOU SAY?

00:17:36.181 --> 00:17:37.450
YOU WERE PART OF THAT?

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:38.751
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:17:38.751 --> 00:17:40.219
&gt;&gt; DID YOU JUST SAY THAT YOU

00:17:40.219 --> 00:17:42.288

00:17:42.288 --> 00:17:43.389
&gt;&gt; HA! I DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU’RE

00:17:43.389 --> 00:17:44.557
TALKING ABOUT.

00:17:44.557 --> 00:17:45.659
I JUST KNOW EVERYONE HERE’S DONE

00:17:45.659 --> 00:17:47.293
A LOT OF BAD THINGS IN THE NAME

00:17:47.293 --> 00:17:49.463
OF THE YELLOW SCARVES.

00:17:49.463 --> 00:17:50.530
I THINK IT’S TIME WE START GOING

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:51.631
BY A DIFFERENT NAME AND

00:17:51.631 --> 00:17:53.200
DIFFERENT COLOR.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.235
YEAH, MAYBE SOMETHING SAD AND

00:17:55.235 --> 00:17:56.737
GLOOMY, LIKE THE COLOR OF YOUR

00:17:56.737 --> 00:17:57.638
FACE.

00:17:57.638 --> 00:18:00.375
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU--NO.

00:18:00.375 --> 00:18:06.281
ALL YOU GUYS, HOW COULD YOU?

00:18:06.281 --> 00:18:08.317
&gt;&gt; YOU FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT.

00:18:08.317 --> 00:18:09.285
WAY TO GO.

00:18:09.285 --> 00:18:10.752
EVERYBODY SURROUNDING YOU RIGHT

00:18:10.752 --> 00:18:12.488
NOW ARE THE GUYS YOU HATE,

00:18:12.488 --> 00:18:13.756
THE BLUE SQUARES.

00:18:13.756 --> 00:18:15.392
SEE, WE AIN’T JUST A BUNCH OF

00:18:15.392 --> 00:18:16.593
LOSERS KEEPING A DEAD GANG

00:18:16.593 --> 00:18:17.460
ALIVE.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.795
NO, WHAT WE ARE IS THE GUYS

00:18:18.795 --> 00:18:19.930
WHO’VE EATEN UP THE YELLOW

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:21.899
SCARVES.

00:18:21.899 --> 00:18:23.934
IT’S YOUR OWN DAMN FAULT.

00:18:23.934 --> 00:18:25.536
ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS TAKE OFF

00:18:25.536 --> 00:18:26.870
OUR BLUE AND ASK TO BE A PART OF

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:28.706
YOUR GANG, AND YOU SUCKERS LET

00:18:28.706 --> 00:18:30.274

00:18:30.274 --> 00:18:33.745
[laughter]

00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:50.263
WHAT’S THE MATTER?

00:18:50.263 --> 00:18:51.532
YOU READY TO DROP TO YOUR KNEES

00:18:51.532 --> 00:18:52.799
AND BEG FOR MERCY?

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:55.336
&gt;&gt; NAH. ACTUALLY, THAT’S QUITE A

00:18:55.336 --> 00:18:56.470
LOAD OFF.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:00.708
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:19:00.708 --> 00:19:02.309
&gt;&gt; SINCE YOU GUYS HAVE FIRED ME

00:19:02.309 --> 00:19:03.711
FROM THE YELLOW SCARVES,

00:19:03.711 --> 00:19:04.946
I’M JUST A KID WHO HITS ON

00:19:04.946 --> 00:19:06.348
CHICKS.

00:19:06.348 --> 00:19:06.814
&gt;&gt; AH?

00:19:06.814 --> 00:19:11.454
[door grinding shut]

00:19:11.454 --> 00:19:12.988
&gt;&gt; I’M JUST YOUR AVERAGE LOSER

00:19:12.988 --> 00:19:14.557
WHO COULDN’T EVEN SAVE THE GIRL

00:19:14.557 --> 00:19:15.524
HE LOVED.

00:19:15.524 --> 00:19:17.560
I REALIZE NOW I WAS AN IDIOT,

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.295
THINKING I COULD TURN MY BACK ON

00:19:19.295 --> 00:19:20.597
MY PAST AND BECOME A NORMAL HIGH

00:19:20.597 --> 00:19:22.031
SCHOOL STUDENT.

00:19:22.031 --> 00:19:23.633
THAT’S WHY I’M HERE.

00:19:23.633 --> 00:19:25.069
YOU SEE, ALL I AM IS MASAOMI

00:19:25.069 --> 00:19:27.404

00:19:29.907 --> 00:19:30.975
&gt;&gt; THAT’S RIGHT.

00:19:30.975 --> 00:19:33.678
THAT’S WHY I’M HERE TONIGHT!

00:19:33.678 --> 00:19:34.779
THE PAST, WHICH HAD BEEN DOGGING

00:19:34.779 --> 00:19:37.048
ME FOR SO LONG, HAD SUDDENLY

00:19:37.048 --> 00:19:38.584
MOVED ON WITHOUT ME.

00:19:38.584 --> 00:19:40.486
&gt;&gt; THERE’S JUST NO ESCAPING IT.

00:19:40.486 --> 00:19:41.753
FOREVER AND EVER AND EVER AND

00:19:41.753 --> 00:19:43.722
EVER.

00:19:43.722 --> 00:19:44.824
A PERSON’S PAST AND THEIR

00:19:44.824 --> 00:19:45.925
MEMORIES CAN BE A VERY SOLITARY

00:19:45.925 --> 00:19:47.560
BURDEN.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.962
&gt;&gt; YOU SEE, IT’S MY TURN NOW TO

00:19:49.962 --> 00:19:52.432
START CHASING THE PAST, RIGHT?

00:19:52.432 --> 00:19:53.400
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.467
&gt;&gt; THEY SAY YOUR PAST CAN GET

00:19:54.467 --> 00:19:55.969
LONELY.

00:19:55.969 --> 00:19:57.437
IF THAT’S TRUE, THEN I NEED TO

00:19:57.437 --> 00:19:58.338
CATCH UP TO IT.

00:19:58.338 --> 00:19:59.072
&gt;&gt; [groans]

00:19:59.072 --> 00:20:00.541
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU BABBLING

00:20:00.541 --> 00:20:05.413
ABOUT, YOU DUMBASS?

00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:08.917
[crowd murmurs approvingly]

00:20:12.955 --> 00:20:14.757
&gt;&gt; JUST SO YOU KNOW, I CAME HERE

00:20:14.757 --> 00:20:16.792
TONIGHT KNOWING THAT I MAY DIE.

00:20:16.792 --> 00:20:17.593
&gt;&gt; [grunts]

00:20:17.593 --> 00:20:19.495
&gt;&gt; BUT WHAT I ALSO KNEW WAS THAT

00:20:19.495 --> 00:20:21.131
I WAS READY TO KILL.

00:20:21.131 --> 00:20:23.466
WELL, TO BE MORE SPECIFIC,

00:20:23.466 --> 00:20:25.469
THE GUY THAT I WANNA KILL

00:20:25.469 --> 00:20:25.969
WOULD BE YOU.

00:20:25.969 --> 00:20:27.638
&gt;&gt; [strained groaning]

00:20:27.638 --> 00:20:29.606
&gt;&gt; I’LL SAY IT AGAIN:

00:20:29.606 --> 00:20:31.108
THAT’S WHY I CAME HERE.

00:20:31.108 --> 00:20:32.576
AND I WON’T LET ANYONE TAKE THAT

00:20:32.576 --> 00:20:33.477
AWAY!

00:20:33.477 --> 00:20:36.080
&gt;&gt; AH! COME ON, MOVE!

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.382
DON’T JUST STAND THERE.

00:20:37.382 --> 00:20:38.750
GET THIS IDIOT!

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.486
&gt;&gt; [yelling]

00:20:46.925 --> 00:20:50.629
&gt;&gt; WHY DID I HESITATE BEFORE?

00:20:50.629 --> 00:20:51.965
IT’S SO SIMPLE.

00:20:51.965 --> 00:20:57.003
[grunting]

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:00.574
&gt;&gt; WHAT THE--?

00:21:00.574 --> 00:21:02.777
COME ON, HE’S JUST ONE GUY!

00:21:02.777 --> 00:21:04.545
&gt;&gt; I AM WHO I AM.

00:21:04.545 --> 00:21:06.581
THAT’S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

00:21:06.581 --> 00:21:09.117
SAKI, I’M NOT SCARED ANYMORE.

00:21:09.117 --> 00:21:11.019
I’LL CATCH MY PAST SOON.

00:21:11.019 --> 00:21:14.556
AND THEN I’LL LEAVE IT BEHIND.

00:21:14.556 --> 00:21:15.624
&gt;&gt; HURRY! WILL YOU DO SOMETHING

00:21:15.624 --> 00:21:17.459
ALREADY?

00:21:17.459 --> 00:21:19.428
YOU MORONS ARE TOTALLY USELESS.

00:21:19.428 --> 00:21:21.063
[grunts]

00:21:25.635 --> 00:21:27.137
OH, RIGHT.

00:21:27.137 --> 00:21:32.209
[safety clicks]

00:21:32.209 --> 00:21:33.143
&gt;&gt; [yells]

00:21:33.143 --> 00:21:37.615
&gt;&gt; [groans]

00:21:37.615 --> 00:21:39.083
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

00:21:39.083 --> 00:21:40.051
HOW’S THAT FEEL?

00:21:40.051 --> 00:21:41.686
TEACH YOU TO MESS WITH ME, YOU

00:21:41.686 --> 00:21:44.723
PIECE OF SHIT.

00:21:44.723 --> 00:21:47.893

00:21:47.893 --> 00:21:49.161
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, YOUR ASS IS MINE

00:21:52.665 --> 00:21:53.733
HUH?

00:21:53.733 --> 00:21:55.068
WHAT THE HELL?

00:21:55.068 --> 00:21:56.169
WHAT ARE YOU FREAKING DOING,

00:21:56.169 --> 00:21:57.470
DUMBASS?

KILLED THIS GUY.

00:22:02.643 --> 00:22:03.877
SO I DECIDED I HAD TO DO

00:22:03.877 --> 00:22:05.212
SOMETHING.

00:22:05.212 --> 00:22:06.547
