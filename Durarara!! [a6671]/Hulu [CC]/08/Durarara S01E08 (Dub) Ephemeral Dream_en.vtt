BUT FOR SOME REASON I CAN’T.

00:08:35.369 --> 00:08:37.971
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING IN THERE?

00:08:37.971 --> 00:08:39.806

00:08:42.242 --> 00:08:43.343

00:09:58.581 --> 00:10:00.449
THE SUPER-SWEET SAUTéED VEGGIES,

00:10:00.449 --> 00:10:02.584

00:10:02.584 --> 00:10:04.286
&gt;&gt; SOMETHING’S WRONG.

00:10:04.286 --> 00:10:05.487
&gt;&gt; NO, YOUR COOKING IS

00:10:05.487 --> 00:10:07.289
DISTINCTIVE AND UNORTHODOX.

00:10:07.289 --> 00:10:10.459
IN FACT IT’S JUST LIKE YOU ARE.

00:10:10.459 --> 00:10:12.328
&gt;&gt; THAT ISN’T A COMPLIMENT.

00:10:12.328 --> 00:10:15.297
I GET IT, I SCREWED UP AGAIN.

00:10:15.297 --> 00:10:16.598
IT’S FINE, DON’T FORCE YOURSELF

00:10:16.598 --> 00:10:17.533
TO EAT IT.

00:10:17.533 --> 00:10:19.334
&gt;&gt; BUT I’M NOT FORCING MYSELF,

00:10:19.334 --> 00:10:21.036
IT REALLY IS QUITE GOOD.

00:10:21.036 --> 00:10:21.637
AAH--

00:10:21.637 --> 00:10:23.471
&gt;&gt; I SAID DON’T EAT IT!

00:10:23.471 --> 00:10:27.242

00:10:44.358 --> 00:10:45.993
WHO CARES IF YOU DON’T HAVE A

00:10:45.993 --> 00:10:49.396

00:10:49.396 --> 00:10:51.064
&gt;&gt; SENS DE WHAT?

00:10:51.064 --> 00:10:52.999
&gt;&gt; IT MEANS SENSE OF TASTE.

00:10:52.999 --> 00:10:54.468
SEE, IF YOUR DNA IS LACKING A

00:10:54.468 --> 00:10:56.202
SENSE OF TASTE, YOUR BRAIN WON’T

00:10:56.202 --> 00:10:58.071
PROCESS IT AT ALL.

00:10:58.071 --> 00:10:59.205
BUT YOU DON’T HAVE TO EAT, SO

00:10:59.205 --> 00:11:01.174
ALL THIS IS IRRELEVANT.

00:11:01.174 --> 00:11:05.311
SO DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT.

00:11:05.311 --> 00:11:07.446
COME ON, CHEER UP, WILL YA?

00:11:07.446 --> 00:11:09.248
HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY WE PLAY A

00:11:11.083 --> 00:11:12.385
&gt;&gt; DON’T TREAT ME LIKE A CHILD,

00:11:12.385 --> 00:11:15.087
IT’LL JUST IRRITATE ME MORE.

00:11:15.087 --> 00:11:16.521

00:11:16.521 --> 00:11:19.124
&gt;&gt; I ADMIT, MOST OF MY MEMORIES

00:11:19.124 --> 00:11:20.125
COME FROM THE YEARS I’VE SPENT

00:11:20.125 --> 00:11:21.393
LIVING WITH YOU.

00:11:21.393 --> 00:11:23.295
BUT SOME OF MY FOGGY MEMORIES

00:11:23.295 --> 00:11:25.363
ARE OVER 100 YEARS OLD.

00:11:25.363 --> 00:11:27.098
AND I KNOW MY HEAD HAS MORE.

00:11:27.098 --> 00:11:28.400
&gt;&gt; DO YOU REALLY NEED MEMORIES

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.267

00:12:44.137 --> 00:12:46.407
MAN, PEOPLE NEED TO GET A LIFE.

00:12:46.407 --> 00:12:48.141
I THINK THAT I MIGHT HAVE AN

00:12:48.141 --> 00:12:49.777
IDEA WHO’S BEHIND ALL THIS.

00:12:49.777 --> 00:12:51.244
&gt;&gt; MASAOMI?

00:12:51.244 --> 00:12:52.345

00:12:58.251 --> 00:12:59.619
&gt;&gt; MASAOMI WAS A LITTLE SCARY

00:12:59.619 --> 00:13:00.720
JUST NOW.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.355
IT WAS ALMOST AS IF HE WAS A

00:13:02.355 --> 00:13:03.590
DIFFERENT PERSON.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:05.157
&gt;&gt; YOU THINK SO?

00:13:05.157 --> 00:13:06.392
I CAN’T BELIEVE THAT HE JUST

00:13:07.159 --> 00:13:09.696
I MEAN, WHAT’S THE RUSH?

00:13:23.809 --> 00:13:25.611
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS A KID

00:13:25.611 --> 00:13:27.212
I USED TO LOSE THINGS ALL THE

00:13:27.212 --> 00:13:28.113
TIME.

00:13:28.113 --> 00:13:29.715
I’D BREAK DOWN AND START CRYING

00:13:29.715 --> 00:13:31.449
"I CAN’T FIND IT, I CAN’T FIND

00:13:31.449 --> 00:13:32.450

&gt;&gt; UH, BUT...

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.646
YOU CAN STOP LOOKING, MASAOMI.

00:14:02.646 --> 00:14:04.814
DON’T WORRY ABOUT WHO DID IT.

00:14:04.814 --> 00:14:07.083

00:14:07.083 --> 00:14:09.352

&gt;&gt; SEE? THAT’S WEIRD, ISN’T IT?

00:14:45.386 --> 00:14:46.387
I DON’T REMEMBER WHAT WAS HERE

00:14:46.387 --> 00:14:47.654
AT ALL.

00:14:47.654 --> 00:14:50.391
EMPTY LOTS KIND OF TRIP ME OUT.

00:14:50.391 --> 00:14:51.758
ONCE THEY TEAR IT ALL DOWN IT’S

00:14:51.758 --> 00:14:54.428
HARD TO REMEMBER WHAT WAS THERE.

00:14:54.428 --> 00:14:55.529
SOMETHING USED TO BE HERE,

00:14:55.529 --> 00:14:57.197

00:15:10.543 --> 00:15:11.677
BUT LOOK AT ME.

00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:13.413
HERE I AM WITH A JOB AND MAKING

00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:15.615
FRIENDS.

00:15:15.615 --> 00:15:16.716
IT’S LIKE I’VE STARTED THINKING

00:15:16.716 --> 00:15:19.519
I’M A HUMAN.

00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:20.786
&gt;&gt; ANYWAY, YOU SAID YOU HAD

00:15:20.786 --> 00:15:21.821
SOMETHING YOU WANTED TO TALK TO

00:15:21.821 --> 00:15:22.621

00:15:22.621 --> 00:15:23.388
WHAT WAS IT?

00:15:29.461 --> 00:15:30.762

00:15:35.834 --> 00:15:38.402
OH, YEAH, THAT OLD CRAPPY ONE.

00:15:38.402 --> 00:15:39.470
THERE WAS AN OLD LADY ON THE

FIRST FLOOR WHO SOLD CIGARETTES.

00:15:41.539 --> 00:15:45.476
WAY TO GO, TRANSPORTER.

00:15:45.476 --> 00:15:46.477
&gt;&gt; I KNOW MY HEAD IS IN THIS

00:15:46.477 --> 00:15:48.479
TOWN, I CAN FEEL IT.

00:15:48.479 --> 00:15:50.781

BUT I FOUND SOME STUFF AND

00:16:46.434 --> 00:16:49.670
DIDN’T FIND SOME STUFF.

00:17:07.354 --> 00:17:09.723

00:17:09.723 --> 00:17:11.625
&gt;&gt; HIS BAG WAS GONE SO I ASSUMED

00:17:11.625 --> 00:17:13.693
HE WAS ON A JOB.

00:17:13.693 --> 00:17:17.330
BUT SOMETHING JUST DIDN’T FEEL

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.232
RIGHT.

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:28.006
&gt;&gt; FIREWORKS?

00:17:28.006 --> 00:17:29.007
&gt;&gt; YEAH, HE WENT ON QUITE A

00:17:29.007 --> 00:17:30.543
RAMPAGE.

00:17:30.543 --> 00:17:31.710
IT TOOK SEVERAL OF OUR GUYS TO

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:33.411
TAKE HIM DOWN.

00:17:33.411 --> 00:17:35.547
&gt;&gt; ALL FOR FIREWORKS?

00:17:35.547 --> 00:17:37.015
&gt;&gt; SEEMS TO ME LIKE YOUR STAFF

00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:39.517
GOT A LITTLE OUT OF HAND.

00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:40.552
&gt;&gt; WELL, HE CAUSED QUITE A

00:17:40.552 --> 00:17:41.853
SCENE.

00:17:41.853 --> 00:17:43.688
KEPT SPOUTING SOME GIBBERISH

00:17:43.688 --> 00:17:44.756
ABOUT HOW HIS GIRLFRIEND WAS

00:17:44.756 --> 00:17:46.591
KIDNAPPED AND THE ONLY THING

00:17:46.591 --> 00:17:47.625
SHE REMEMBERS FROM THAT NIGHT

00:17:47.625 --> 00:17:49.326
WAS THIS PLACE.

00:17:49.326 --> 00:17:50.461
THEN HE DEMANDED WE TELL HIM

00:17:50.461 --> 00:17:51.528
WHAT WE DID TO HER.

00:17:51.528 --> 00:17:52.730
&gt;&gt; HE WASN’T SPOUTING GIBBERISH,

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.966
HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.

00:17:54.966 --> 00:17:56.533
&gt;&gt; ANYWAY, DOC, THINK YOU CAN

00:17:56.533 --> 00:17:58.302
FIX IT? MAKE IT SO THAT HE

00:17:58.302 --> 00:17:59.703
DOESN’T REMEMBER THIS PLACE WHEN

00:17:59.703 --> 00:18:01.004
HE WAKES UP?

00:18:01.004 --> 00:18:02.339
THAT’S ALL THAT WE’RE ASKING OF

00:18:02.339 --> 00:18:03.674
YOU, OKAY?

00:18:03.674 --> 00:18:04.841
&gt;&gt; THERE’S NO EASY WAY TO DO

00:18:04.841 --> 00:18:06.710
THAT, MEMORIES ARE A TRICKY

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:07.944
THING TO GET RID OF.

00:18:07.944 --> 00:18:10.681
AND PLUS, I’LL REMEMBER THIS

00:18:10.681 --> 00:18:11.715
KID.

00:18:11.715 --> 00:18:12.749
&gt;&gt; LISTEN, WE ARE GONNA RELEASE

00:18:12.749 --> 00:18:15.685
HIM, BUT WHETHER HE WILL GO HOME

00:18:15.685 --> 00:18:17.653
OR NOT I’M NOT SO SURE.

00:18:22.725 --> 00:18:24.694
ALL RIGHT, LET’S BE CLEAR,

00:18:24.694 --> 00:18:25.861
DOCTOR.

00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:27.062
THE CHIEF AND I BOTH TRUST YOU

00:18:27.062 --> 00:18:29.098
COMPLETELY.

00:18:29.098 --> 00:18:30.565
AFTER ALL, YOU ARE KEEPING THAT

00:18:30.565 --> 00:18:32.001
THING A SECRET.

00:18:32.001 --> 00:18:34.069
OH, AND BY THE WAY, THAT

00:18:34.069 --> 00:18:36.438
ROOMMATE YOU HAVE, SHE IS MORE

00:18:36.438 --> 00:18:37.539
THAN JUST YOUR AVERAGE

00:18:37.539 --> 00:18:41.410
HOUSEGUEST, ISN’T SHE?

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:42.411
&gt;&gt; AT THAT MOMENT MY FOCUS

00:18:42.411 --> 00:18:45.079
SHIFTED.

00:18:45.079 --> 00:18:47.515
I WASN’T THINKING ABOUT MY HEAD,

00:18:47.515 --> 00:18:48.482
NOR THE CENTURY WORTH OF

00:18:48.482 --> 00:18:49.650
DULLAHAN MEMORIES THAT LIVE

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:52.753
INSIDE IT.

00:18:52.753 --> 00:18:54.922
I WASN’T THINKING OF ANYTHING...

00:18:54.922 --> 00:18:57.958
EXCEPT THAT.

00:19:14.607 --> 00:19:16.643
&gt;&gt; HEY, WILL YOU COME EAT WITH

00:19:16.643 --> 00:19:18.144
ME?

00:19:18.144 --> 00:19:19.912
THE RESTAURANT WON’T COMPLAIN

00:19:19.912 --> 00:19:22.381
IF I ORDER DINNER FOR TWO.

00:19:22.381 --> 00:19:24.516
I KNOW A REALLY GREAT PLACE.

00:19:24.516 --> 00:19:26.552
PLEASE, CELTY.

00:19:26.552 --> 00:19:27.887
TO BE HONEST, I HATE EATING BY

00:19:27.887 --> 00:19:31.723
MYSELF.

00:19:31.723 --> 00:19:32.858
WHAT IS THIS CONVOLUTED

00:19:32.858 --> 00:19:34.793

00:19:48.506 --> 00:19:49.607
