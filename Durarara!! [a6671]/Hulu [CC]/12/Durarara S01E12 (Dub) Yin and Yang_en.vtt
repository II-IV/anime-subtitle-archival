00:07:44.254 --> 00:07:45.355
I’M GUESSING YOU WANT TO KNOW

00:07:45.355 --> 00:07:48.024
WHY I DID WHAT I DID.

00:07:48.024 --> 00:07:50.226
AND YOUR NEXT QUESTION IS...

00:07:50.226 --> 00:07:51.662
"YOU’VE KNOWN ALL ALONG, HAVEN’T

00:07:51.662 --> 00:07:52.162
YOU?

00:07:52.162 --> 00:07:54.230
THAT MY HEAD WAS IN THEIR LAB?

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.099
I BET YOU AND YOUR DAD HAD BEEN

00:07:56.099 --> 00:07:56.967
WORKING WITH YAGIRI

00:07:56.967 --> 00:07:58.969
PHARMACEUTICALS THIS WHOLE TIME.

00:07:58.969 --> 00:08:00.704
AND CHANCES ARE IT WAS YOUR DAD

00:08:00.704 --> 00:08:02.005
WHO TOOK MY HEAD FROM ME IN

00:08:02.005 --> 00:08:03.073
THE FIRST PLACE!

00:08:03.073 --> 00:08:04.208
BUT FOR SOME REASON YOU DECIDED

00:08:04.208 --> 00:08:05.976
TO HIDE ALL THAT FROM ME.

00:08:05.976 --> 00:08:07.211
AND BUTCHERED SOME POOR,

00:08:07.211 --> 00:08:09.113
INNOCENT GIRL’S FACE INSTEAD!

00:08:09.113 --> 00:08:10.814
I MAY BE A MONSTER...

00:08:10.814 --> 00:08:12.083
BUT THE SAVAGE BEAST WHO REALLY

00:08:12.083 --> 00:08:14.218
DESTROYS PEOPLE’S LIVES IS YOU!"

00:08:14.218 --> 00:08:15.753
WAS THAT CLOSE?

00:08:15.753 --> 00:08:17.354
LOOK, I JUST DON’T WANT THERE

00:08:17.354 --> 00:08:18.956
TO BE ANY CONFUSION ON THIS.

00:08:18.956 --> 00:08:20.057
I REALLY DON’T KNOW IF MY DAD

00:08:20.057 --> 00:08:21.626
STOLE YOUR HEAD OR NOT, AND, TO

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:22.994
BE HONEST, I DON’T CARE.

00:08:22.994 --> 00:08:24.362
AND THAT POOR GIRL YOU SPOKE OF

00:08:24.362 --> 00:08:25.897
VOLUNTEERED FOR THAT SURGERY,

00:08:25.897 --> 00:08:28.366
ALTHOUGH CHANCES ARE YAGIRI DID

00:08:28.366 --> 00:08:30.768
PERSUADE HER TO DO IT.

00:08:30.768 --> 00:08:31.903
BUT IN THE END, THAT’S NONE OF

00:08:31.903 --> 00:08:34.072
MY BUSINESS.

00:08:34.072 --> 00:08:35.040
"DO YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT I’M

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.041
THINKING?

00:08:36.041 --> 00:08:37.042
ARE YOU ACTUALLY READING MY

00:08:37.042 --> 00:08:38.977
MIND?" YOU ASK?

00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:41.113
YES...OF COURSE I CAN.

00:08:41.113 --> 00:08:42.715
I’VE LOVED YOU FOR TWENTY YEARS,

00:08:42.715 --> 00:08:43.281
CELTY.

00:08:43.281 --> 00:08:45.183
I CAN TELL WHAT YOU’RE THINKING.

00:08:45.183 --> 00:08:46.051
&gt;&gt; [gasps]

00:08:46.051 --> 00:08:47.285
&gt;&gt; BUT THEN WHY?

00:08:47.285 --> 00:08:48.887
IF YOU LOVE ME, WHY DIDN’T YOU

00:08:48.887 --> 00:08:51.724
TELL ME WHERE MY HEAD WAS?

00:08:51.724 --> 00:08:53.426
&gt;&gt; THAT’S THE REASON.

00:08:53.426 --> 00:08:55.027
IT’S BECAUSE I LOVE YOU THAT I

00:08:55.027 --> 00:08:55.961
DIDN’T TELL YOU.

00:08:55.961 --> 00:08:57.763
IF YOU HAD YOUR HEAD, THEN I’M

00:08:57.763 --> 00:08:59.298
AFRAID YOU WOULD LEAVE ME.

00:08:59.298 --> 00:09:00.333
AND I KNOW THAT I COULDN’T BEAR

00:09:00.333 --> 00:09:02.001
THAT.

00:09:02.001 --> 00:09:03.069
EVEN THOUGH I KNEW IT’D MAKE

00:09:03.069 --> 00:09:05.004
YOU HAPPY, I COULDN’T TELL YOU.

00:09:05.004 --> 00:09:06.205
WE’RE EACH FIGHTING FOR

00:09:06.205 --> 00:09:07.740
SOMETHING, AND WHAT’S AT STAKE

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.875
ARE OUR HEARTS.

00:09:08.875 --> 00:09:10.376
I NEVER WANT TO LOSE YOU.

00:09:10.376 --> 00:09:11.678
AND IF I HAVE TO SACRIFICE THE

00:09:11.678 --> 00:09:13.212
LIFE AND LOVE OF OTHERS, OR

00:09:13.212 --> 00:09:15.882
EVEN MYSELF, THEN SO BE IT.

00:09:15.882 --> 00:09:17.050
IT’S HYPOCRITICAL...

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:18.051
BUT IF I HAVE TO USE YOUR

00:09:18.051 --> 00:09:23.257
EMOTIONS TOO, I WILL.

00:09:23.257 --> 00:09:24.358
&gt;&gt; I DON’T KNOW WHY YOU’D THINK

00:09:24.358 --> 00:09:25.292
THAT.

00:09:25.292 --> 00:09:26.693
EVEN IF I HAD MY HEAD, I

00:09:26.693 --> 00:09:27.461
WOULDN’T LEAVE YOU.

00:09:27.461 --> 00:09:28.195
I...

00:09:28.195 --> 00:09:29.696
&gt;&gt; THAT MAY BE WHAT YOUR HEART

00:09:29.696 --> 00:09:31.465
WANTS, BUT...YOUR HEAD MAY NOT

00:09:31.465 --> 00:09:33.300
FEEL THE SAME.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.768
I’VE REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THIS.

00:09:34.768 --> 00:09:36.470
YOU’RE A MYTHICAL FAERIE.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:37.738
WHY DO YOU CHOOSE TO REVEAL

00:09:37.738 --> 00:09:39.273
YOURSELF TO HUMANS AS EASILY AS

00:09:39.273 --> 00:09:40.975
YOU DO?

00:09:40.975 --> 00:09:42.176
MAYBE SOMEHOW BY LOSING YOUR

00:09:42.176 --> 00:09:44.011
HEAD, IT’S ALLOWED YOU TO TAKE

00:09:44.011 --> 00:09:46.080
ON MORE OF A PHYSICAL FORM.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.248
AND IF THAT’S TRUE, THEN WHO’S

00:09:48.248 --> 00:09:49.784
TO SAY AFTER YOU GET YOUR HEAD

00:09:49.784 --> 00:09:51.118
BACK THAT YOU WON’T JUST VANISH

00:09:51.118 --> 00:09:53.321
INTO THIN AIR, AS IF ALL OF

00:09:53.321 --> 00:09:54.322
THIS WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A

00:09:54.322 --> 00:09:56.091
DREAM?

00:09:56.091 --> 00:09:58.159
THAT’S MY BIGGEST FEAR.

00:10:06.134 --> 00:10:07.402
&gt;&gt; WILL YOU BELIEVE WHAT I’M

00:10:07.402 --> 00:10:09.971
ABOUT TO SAY?

00:10:09.971 --> 00:10:11.172
&gt;&gt; IF YOU SAY IT’S TRUE, I’LL

00:10:11.172 --> 00:10:11.873
BELIEVE YOU.

00:10:11.873 --> 00:10:13.341
TO BE HONEST, YOU’RE THE ONLY

00:10:13.341 --> 00:10:15.243
ONE I BELIEVE.

00:10:15.243 --> 00:10:17.145
&gt;&gt; I’M SCARED TOO.

00:10:17.145 --> 00:10:20.182
I’M SCARED OF DYING.

00:10:20.182 --> 00:10:21.350
I KNOW THAT IN MY CURRENT

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.484
PHYSICAL STATE, NO ONE’S

00:10:22.484 --> 00:10:25.221
CAPABLE OF KILLING ME.

00:10:25.221 --> 00:10:26.788
THIS ISN’T ME BEING ARROGANT.

00:10:26.788 --> 00:10:28.424
IT JUST A STATEMENT OF FACT.

00:10:28.424 --> 00:10:30.259
I TAKE NO JOY OR SATISFACTION

00:10:30.259 --> 00:10:31.227
FROM THIS.

00:10:31.227 --> 00:10:33.262
IT’S JUST TRUE.

00:10:33.262 --> 00:10:34.363
BUT, TO BE HONEST, THAT’S WHAT

00:10:34.363 --> 00:10:36.232
SCARES ME THE MOST.

00:10:36.232 --> 00:10:38.100
MY BODY HAS NO CONTROL OVER

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.202
WHETHER OR NOT I LIVE OR DIE.

00:10:40.202 --> 00:10:43.806
MY HEAD HAS THAT POWER.

00:10:43.806 --> 00:10:44.907
AND IF SOMEONE WERE TO DESTROY

00:10:44.907 --> 00:10:46.943
MY HEAD, THEN I WOULD DIE TOO,

00:10:46.943 --> 00:10:49.146
NO MATTER WHAT I WANT OR WHERE

00:10:49.146 --> 00:10:53.183
I AM!

00:10:53.183 --> 00:10:54.351
I NEED YOU TO BELIEVE WHAT I’M

00:10:54.351 --> 00:10:55.318
TELLING YOU.

00:10:55.318 --> 00:10:56.786
I MAY NOT HAVE A BRAIN OR EYES,

00:10:56.786 --> 00:10:58.956
BUT THIS GIVES ME NIGHTMARES.

00:10:58.956 --> 00:11:00.257
I NEED YOU TO BELIEVE THAT THIS

00:11:00.257 --> 00:11:02.125
THOUGHT TERRORIZES ME!

00:11:02.125 --> 00:11:03.160
I’M SCARED OF THE FACT THAT MY

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.795
OWN DEATH MAY BE STARING ME IN

00:11:04.795 --> 00:11:05.896
THE FACE, AND I WON’T EVEN SEE

00:11:05.896 --> 00:11:06.930
IT COMING.

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:09.199
THAT’S WHY I WANT MY HEAD.

00:11:09.199 --> 00:11:12.836
PLEASE TELL ME YOU BELIEVE THIS.

00:11:12.836 --> 00:11:14.137
&gt;&gt; I TOLD YOU.

00:11:14.137 --> 00:11:15.005
YOU’RE THE ONLY ONE I DO

00:11:15.005 --> 00:11:16.274
BELIEVE.

00:11:16.274 --> 00:11:17.341
THIS IS QUITE A CONUNDRUM.

00:11:17.341 --> 00:11:18.842
BOTH OF US ARE GETTING VERY

00:11:18.842 --> 00:11:20.278
UPSET BY SITUATIONS THAT ARE

00:11:20.278 --> 00:11:22.413
SIMPLY HYPOTHETICAL.

00:11:22.413 --> 00:11:26.317
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YOU’RE RIGHT.

00:11:26.317 --> 00:11:27.218
HEY, SHINRA...

00:11:27.218 --> 00:11:31.489
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS IT?

00:11:31.489 --> 00:11:33.324
&gt;&gt; I NEED TO HIT YOU.

00:11:33.324 --> 00:11:38.397
&gt;&gt; DO IT!

00:11:38.397 --> 00:11:39.931
ALL RIGHT, NOW I GET TO HIT

00:11:39.931 --> 00:11:42.201
YOU BACK.

00:11:52.277 --> 00:11:52.978
&gt;&gt; UH.

00:11:52.978 --> 00:11:53.846
&gt;&gt; PERFECT.

00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:54.847
YOU’RE PRETTIEST WHEN YOU’RE

00:11:54.847 --> 00:11:58.517
NOT HIDING YOUR FACE, YOU KNOW.

00:11:58.517 --> 00:12:00.185
THAT PUNCH WAS A KISS...TO

00:12:00.185 --> 00:12:01.521
CELEBRATE OUR MARRIAGE.

00:12:01.521 --> 00:12:03.456
OKAY?

00:12:03.456 --> 00:12:04.857
OW.

00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:07.159
[groans]

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:15.568
ARE YOU CRYING?

00:12:29.315 --> 00:12:31.552
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS QUITE ASTOUNDING.

00:12:31.552 --> 00:12:33.219
MM?

00:12:33.219 --> 00:12:36.557
&gt;&gt; [mutters]

00:12:36.557 --> 00:12:38.124
&gt;&gt; YO, IZAYA.

00:12:38.124 --> 00:12:40.127
&gt;&gt; DOTACHIN. BEEN AWHILE.

00:12:40.127 --> 00:12:41.528
&gt;&gt; WILL YA STOP CALLIN’ ME THAT?

00:12:41.528 --> 00:12:42.596
&gt;&gt; YEAH, ANYWAYS DO YOU KNOW

00:12:42.596 --> 00:12:43.897
WHERE THE NAME THE DOLLARS COMES

00:12:43.897 --> 00:12:45.299
FROM?

00:12:45.299 --> 00:12:46.300
&gt;&gt; ISN’T IT SOMETHIN’ LIKE,

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.668
"GIMME ALL YOUR DOLLARS"?

00:12:47.668 --> 00:12:49.904
&gt;&gt; NO, NOT EVEN CLOSE.

00:12:49.904 --> 00:12:50.571
IT COMES FROM THE FACT THAT

00:12:50.571 --> 00:12:51.906
THEY DON’T DO ANYTHING.

00:12:51.906 --> 00:12:54.141
THEY JUST DAWDLE AROUND ALL DAY.

00:12:54.141 --> 00:12:56.010
BUT "DOLLARS" SOUNDS COOLER.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.612
&gt;&gt; DOTACHIN, TELL ME YOU SAW IT

00:12:57.612 --> 00:12:58.279
TOO!

00:12:58.279 --> 00:12:59.346
THE BLACK RIDER!

00:12:59.346 --> 00:13:00.347
&gt;&gt; I TOTALLY CAN’T BELIEVE THAT

00:13:00.347 --> 00:13:01.416
JUST HAPPENED.

00:13:01.416 --> 00:13:02.417
I DIDN’T HALLUCINATE ALL THAT

00:13:02.417 --> 00:13:03.551
CRAZINESS, DID I?

00:13:03.551 --> 00:13:05.387
IT WAS LIKE A CG CHARACTER OR

00:13:05.387 --> 00:13:06.120
SOMETHING.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.455
&gt;&gt; THAT CG CHARACTER IS ALSO

00:13:07.455 --> 00:13:08.923
PART OF THE DOLLARS.

00:13:08.923 --> 00:13:10.392
&gt;&gt; both: WHAT? WOW!

00:13:10.392 --> 00:13:11.193
&gt;&gt; IS THAT TRUE?

00:13:11.193 --> 00:13:12.027
&gt;&gt; both: THAT IS SO COOL!

00:13:12.027 --> 00:13:14.589
SO COOL. SO COOL.

00:13:18.033 --> 00:13:19.334
&gt;&gt; I’M A LITTLE SHOCKED BY ALL

00:13:19.334 --> 00:13:20.502
THIS.

00:13:20.502 --> 00:13:21.436
I KNEW THERE WERE A LOT OF

00:13:21.436 --> 00:13:22.570
PEOPLE ONLINE CLAIMING THAT

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:23.572
THEY WERE MEMBERS OF THE

00:13:23.572 --> 00:13:24.707
DOLLARS.

00:13:24.707 --> 00:13:26.374
HOWEVER, I HAD NO IDEA SO MANY

00:13:26.374 --> 00:13:27.943
OF THEM WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE AN

00:13:27.943 --> 00:13:28.644
EFFORT TO TURN UP WHEN A

00:13:28.644 --> 00:13:30.579
MEETING WAS FINALLY CALLED.

00:13:30.579 --> 00:13:31.580
[laughs]

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.949
HUMAN BEINGS DEFY IMAGINATION.

00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:35.584
REMEMBER, I KNOW YOU CAME HERE

00:13:35.584 --> 00:13:37.420
TO TOKYO HOPING TO ESCAPE THE

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.455
HUMDRUM, BUT IN ABOUT SIX

00:13:39.455 --> 00:13:41.024
MONTHS, THIS’LL ALL SEEM

00:13:41.024 --> 00:13:42.591
PRETTY ORDINARY TO YOU.

00:13:42.591 --> 00:13:44.293
AT THAT RATE, YOU’LL HAVE TO

00:13:44.293 --> 00:13:45.561
MOVE TO ANOTHER COUNTRY TO KEEP

00:13:45.561 --> 00:13:46.730
THINGS EXCITING OR START

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:47.663
LOOKING FOR THINGS THAT ARE A

00:13:47.663 --> 00:13:50.466
LITTLE MORE UNDERGROUND.

00:13:50.466 --> 00:13:51.635
BUT I’D BE WILLING TO BET THAT

00:13:51.635 --> 00:13:54.203
YOU WOULD GET BORED OF THAT IN

00:13:54.203 --> 00:13:55.705
JUST A FEW DAYS AS WELL.

00:13:55.705 --> 00:13:56.973
&gt;&gt; [breathes angrily]

00:13:56.973 --> 00:13:58.308
&gt;&gt; THE ONLY WAY TO TRULY ESCAPE

00:13:58.308 --> 00:14:00.076
THE MUNDANE IS FOR YOU TO

00:14:00.076 --> 00:14:02.279
CONSTANTLY BE EVOLVING.

00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:03.747
WHETHER YOU CHOOSE TO AIM HIGH

00:14:03.747 --> 00:14:06.616
OR AIM LOW...

00:14:06.616 --> 00:14:08.752
ENJOY EACH DAY FOR WHAT IT IS.

00:14:08.752 --> 00:14:12.189
NOW, AS A SIGN OF RESPECT, I’VE

00:14:12.189 --> 00:14:13.758
DECIDED NOT TO CHARGE YOU FOR

00:14:13.758 --> 00:14:15.259
NAMIE YAGIRI’S PRIVATE CELL

00:14:15.259 --> 00:14:17.161
PHONE NUMBER, AND I’M NOT

00:14:17.161 --> 00:14:18.362
GONNA SELL YOU OUT ON BEING

00:14:18.362 --> 00:14:21.031
THE FOUNDER OF THE DOLLARS.

00:14:21.031 --> 00:14:22.767
IT’S YOUR ORGANIZATION.

00:14:22.767 --> 00:14:25.302
USE IT HOWEVER YOU CHOOSE.

00:14:30.007 --> 00:14:31.008
&gt;&gt; [whimpers]

00:14:31.008 --> 00:14:33.644
&gt;&gt; [growls] IZAYA!

00:14:33.644 --> 00:14:35.313
&gt;&gt; LOOKS LIKE IT’S TIME FOR ME

00:14:35.313 --> 00:14:36.681
TO GO.

00:14:36.681 --> 00:14:37.682
BEST OF LUCK TO YA,

00:14:37.682 --> 00:14:41.019
TARO TANAKA!

00:14:41.019 --> 00:14:42.788
&gt;&gt; GET BACK HERE, YOU BASTARD!

00:14:42.788 --> 00:14:45.423
IZAYA!

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.497
&gt;&gt; WAS THAT...?

00:14:51.497 --> 00:14:53.164
[cries out]

00:14:53.164 --> 00:14:54.366
&gt;&gt; GET ’EM WHILE THEY’RE GOOD!

00:14:54.366 --> 00:14:55.701
&gt;&gt; AND THAT WAS IT.

00:14:55.701 --> 00:14:56.768
THE NEXT DAY, EVERYTHING WENT

00:14:56.768 --> 00:14:58.770
BACK TO NORMAL.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.038
FOR THIS GUY...

00:15:00.038 --> 00:15:01.207
AND THAT GUY...

00:15:01.207 --> 00:15:02.741
AND FOR THE BOY.

00:15:02.741 --> 00:15:04.043
&gt;&gt; HEY, MIKADO.

00:15:04.043 --> 00:15:05.577
GUESS WHAT I READ ONLINE.

00:15:05.577 --> 00:15:07.079
THE DOLLARS HAD A HUGE MEETING

00:15:07.079 --> 00:15:08.114
YESTERDAY!

00:15:08.114 --> 00:15:09.181
THEY’RE SAYING IT WAS OFF THE

00:15:09.181 --> 00:15:10.582
HOOK AND THAT SHIZUO AND SIMON

00:15:10.582 --> 00:15:12.218
ARE TOTALLY PART OF ’EM!

00:15:12.218 --> 00:15:13.319
AND THAT BLACK RIDER WAS THERE,

00:15:13.319 --> 00:15:14.787
AND IT IS HEADLESS.

00:15:14.787 --> 00:15:16.155
IT, LIKE, RODE DOWN WALLS.

00:15:16.155 --> 00:15:17.289
AND IT HAS THIS SCYTHE, WHICH

00:15:17.289 --> 00:15:18.825
IT WAS TOTALLY SWINGING AROUND

00:15:18.825 --> 00:15:20.226
ALL CRAZY LIKE!

00:15:20.226 --> 00:15:21.461
&gt;&gt; YOU’RE NOT MAKING ANY SENSE,

00:15:21.461 --> 00:15:22.795
YOU KNOW.

00:15:22.795 --> 00:15:24.797
&gt;&gt; AND EVEN FOR THOSE TWO.

00:15:24.797 --> 00:15:25.798
&gt;&gt; I DON’T HAVE ANY LOVE FOR

00:15:25.798 --> 00:15:27.767
YOU AT ALL.

00:15:27.767 --> 00:15:29.769
BUT WHENEVER I SEE YOUR FACE,

00:15:29.769 --> 00:15:31.838
I’M REMINDED OF THE PASSION

00:15:31.838 --> 00:15:33.773
AND LOVE I HAVE FOR HER.

00:15:33.773 --> 00:15:34.741
SO WITH THAT IN MIND, I’LL

00:15:34.741 --> 00:15:36.276
ACCEPT YOUR LOVE...

00:15:36.276 --> 00:15:38.178
UNTIL THE DAY I FINALLY GET HER

00:15:38.178 --> 00:15:40.047
BACK.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:50.724
&gt;&gt; HEY, GUYS.

00:15:50.724 --> 00:15:51.759
&gt;&gt; HEY, I’VE JUST BEEN HANGIN’

00:15:51.759 --> 00:15:52.560
AROUND.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.461
&gt;&gt; OH, HEY.

00:15:53.461 --> 00:15:54.728
AFRAID I WON’T BE HERE LONG,

00:15:54.728 --> 00:15:56.830
I’M KINDA TIRED TONIGHT.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:57.698
&gt;&gt; WHAT, YOU PULL AN

00:15:57.698 --> 00:15:59.133
ALL-NIGHTER?

00:15:59.133 --> 00:16:00.534
&gt;&gt; YEAH, KINDA.

00:16:00.534 --> 00:16:01.735
&gt;&gt; LOOKS LIKE KANRA STILL ISN’T

00:16:01.735 --> 00:16:02.703
HERE YET.

00:16:02.703 --> 00:16:05.206
&gt;&gt; WONDER IF KANRA WILL SHOW UP.

00:16:05.206 --> 00:16:06.841
&gt;&gt; HEY, SOMETHING JUST CAME UP.

00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:08.109
I GOTTA RUN.

00:16:08.109 --> 00:16:09.210
&gt;&gt; YEAH, SURE.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:11.345
&gt;&gt; SORRY. SEE YA LATER.

00:16:11.345 --> 00:16:15.717
&gt;&gt; SEE YA.

00:16:15.717 --> 00:16:17.118
&gt;&gt; HEY, SORRY, BUT A JOB JUST

00:16:17.118 --> 00:16:17.886
CAME IN.

00:16:17.886 --> 00:16:19.888
THEY SAID IT’S KINDA URGENT.

00:16:19.888 --> 00:16:21.223
&gt;&gt; THAT’S FINE.

00:16:21.223 --> 00:16:23.358
MY LIFE, IT WENT BACK TO

00:16:23.358 --> 00:16:25.394
NORMAL AS WELL.

00:16:25.394 --> 00:16:26.561
RUNNING ACROSS PEOPLE I’D

00:16:26.561 --> 00:16:28.730
RATHER NOT MEET, JUST LIKE IT

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.833
WAS ANY OTHER DAY.

00:16:30.833 --> 00:16:31.801
&gt;&gt; IT LOOKS LIKE YOU’VE MOVED

00:16:31.801 --> 00:16:32.902
ON.

00:16:32.902 --> 00:16:34.136
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF

00:16:34.136 --> 00:16:35.337
SPOOKY THINGS ’CAUSE THEY TEND

00:16:35.337 --> 00:16:36.205
TO LURK IN THE DARK AND THEN

00:16:36.205 --> 00:16:37.773
JUMP OUT AT YOU.

00:16:37.773 --> 00:16:39.441
AFTER THAT LITTLE ENTRANCE YOU

00:16:39.441 --> 00:16:41.677
MADE, I DOUBT ANYONE’S GONNA

00:16:41.677 --> 00:16:43.345
BE SCARED OF YOU ANYMORE.

00:16:43.345 --> 00:16:44.614
THINKING BACK, YOU DIDN’T KILL

00:16:44.614 --> 00:16:45.815
ANYONE, DID YOU?

00:16:45.815 --> 00:16:47.250
THAT SCYTHE ALL BARK AND NO

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:47.883
BITE.

00:16:47.883 --> 00:16:49.185
I’M GUESSING YOU’RE GONNA GO

00:16:49.185 --> 00:16:50.686
AFTER THAT WOMAN NOW.

00:16:50.686 --> 00:16:51.721
I WOULD BE GLAD TO HELP YOU OUT

00:16:51.721 --> 00:16:53.156
WITH THAT.

00:16:53.156 --> 00:16:56.626
JUST CALL ME.

00:16:56.626 --> 00:16:58.261
BYE NOW.

00:16:58.261 --> 00:16:59.262
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE

00:16:59.262 --> 00:17:01.231
NAMIE YAGIRI WENT.

00:17:01.231 --> 00:17:03.767
BUT I DON’T CARE. I’M ME...

00:17:03.767 --> 00:17:05.602
AND THAT’S ENOUGH.

00:17:05.602 --> 00:17:06.637
MY DAYS WERE ALWAYS PRETTY

00:17:06.637 --> 00:17:08.705
UNCOMPLICATED, NOT TOO FULL OF

00:17:08.705 --> 00:17:10.206
HOPE OR DESPAIR.

00:17:10.206 --> 00:17:11.842
AND THEY’RE STILL LIKE THAT.

00:17:11.842 --> 00:17:14.177
IT’S JUST THAT NOW I FIND THEM

00:17:14.177 --> 00:17:16.713
INCREDIBLY SATISFYING.

00:17:16.713 --> 00:17:20.217
HERE I AM, AND THERE YOU ARE.

00:17:20.217 --> 00:17:21.218
IF YOU CAN FIND REDEMPTION IN

00:17:21.218 --> 00:17:22.853
ME, THEN I CAN DO THE SAME

00:17:22.853 --> 00:17:28.592
WITH YOU.

00:17:28.592 --> 00:17:29.727
AND THE YOUNG BOY IS STILL

00:17:29.727 --> 00:17:31.428
PONDERING HIS CONVERSATION WITH

00:17:31.428 --> 00:17:33.798
IZAYA ORIHARA.

00:17:33.798 --> 00:17:34.899
CAN A PERSON TRULY HAVE A LIFE

00:17:34.899 --> 00:17:37.301
THAT’S ALWAYS NEW, ALWAYS FULL

00:17:37.301 --> 00:17:39.904
OF EXCITEMENT AND POSSIBILITY?

00:17:39.904 --> 00:17:40.905
OR IS IT JUST A MATTER OF TIME

00:17:40.905 --> 00:17:43.608
BEFORE THAT TOO BECOMES PART OF

00:17:43.608 --> 00:17:45.643
THE EVERYDAY?

00:17:45.643 --> 00:17:46.711
&gt;&gt; HEY, I’M SORRY FOR

00:17:46.711 --> 00:17:47.445
EVERYTHING.

00:17:47.445 --> 00:17:48.446
&gt;&gt; AND THANK YOU.

00:17:48.446 --> 00:17:50.916
&gt;&gt; [mutters]

00:17:55.487 --> 00:17:55.954
&gt;&gt; WAIT A SEC.

00:17:55.954 --> 00:17:57.690
THAT’S MY SEAT!

00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:58.724
&gt;&gt; WELL, THERE’S A SPOT OPEN

00:17:58.724 --> 00:18:00.392
BEHIND THE CLASS REP.

00:18:00.392 --> 00:18:01.293
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:18:01.293 --> 00:18:02.928
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

00:18:02.928 --> 00:18:04.530
YOU CAN’T JUST SHOW UP AND TAKE

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:09.902
SOMEBODY’S SEAT.

00:18:09.902 --> 00:18:11.870
&gt;&gt; AS FOR HER, CHANCES ARE SHE

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:12.971
WON’T BE SPENDING MUCH TIME

00:18:12.971 --> 00:18:15.241
WITH MIKA HARIMA ANYMORE.

00:18:15.241 --> 00:18:17.243
AND IN THE END, ONLY SHE WILL

00:18:17.243 --> 00:18:18.011
KNOW IF THAT’S THE RIGHT

00:18:18.011 --> 00:18:19.745
DECISION.

00:18:19.745 --> 00:18:21.981
BUT THEN, MAYBE SHE WON’T.

00:18:21.981 --> 00:18:23.316
IT’S RARE FOR A PERSON TO TRULY

00:18:23.316 --> 00:18:25.852
UNDERSTAND THEIR OWN HEART.

00:18:25.852 --> 00:18:27.520
AS SOMEONE ONCE SAID, THE

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.789
BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS KEEP

00:18:29.789 --> 00:18:32.025
EVOLVING.

00:18:32.025 --> 00:18:33.326
HE WAS EMPOWERED BY HIS

00:18:33.326 --> 00:18:35.529
PREVIOUS ACTIONS, SO HE THOUGHT

00:18:35.529 --> 00:18:36.996
HE COULD DO ANYTHING NOW.

00:18:36.996 --> 00:18:38.765
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, WHAT THE

00:18:38.765 --> 00:18:39.933
YOUNG BOY HAD FAILED TO ACCOUNT

00:18:39.933 --> 00:18:42.336
FOR WAS THE SHEER AMOUNT OF

00:18:42.336 --> 00:18:43.937
COURAGE IT WOULD TAKE IN ORDER

00:18:43.937 --> 00:18:45.272
FOR HIM TO ASK OUT HIS

00:18:45.272 --> 00:18:47.007
CLASSMATE.

00:18:47.007 --> 00:18:50.945
[breathes deeply]

00:18:50.945 --> 00:18:52.813
IN 30 SECONDS, THE BOY WILL

00:18:52.813 --> 00:18:54.448
FIND THE GIRL.

00:18:54.448 --> 00:18:56.651
IN 35 SECONDS, THE BOY WILL

00:18:56.651 --> 00:18:57.785
DISCOVER HIS BEST FRIEND

00:18:57.785 --> 00:18:59.820
HITTING ON THE GIRL.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.489
IN 45 SECONDS, THE BOY WILL

00:19:01.489 --> 00:19:04.292
KICK THE CRAP OUT OF HIM.

00:19:04.292 --> 00:19:05.993
IN 74 SECONDS, THE GIRL WILL

00:19:05.993 --> 00:19:07.528
REJECT THE BOY’S OFFER TO GET

00:19:07.528 --> 00:19:08.363
COFFEE.

00:19:08.363 --> 00:19:10.631
AND, IN 78 SECONDS, THAT GIRL

00:19:10.631 --> 00:19:11.832
WILL ASK THE BOY TO HAVE LUNCH

00:19:11.832 --> 00:19:14.069
WITH HER ON THE ROOF.

00:19:14.069 --> 00:19:15.503
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR HIM

00:19:15.503 --> 00:19:17.538
TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HER?

00:19:17.538 --> 00:19:19.074
AND HOW LONG BEFORE HE WORKS UP

00:19:19.074 --> 00:19:21.910
THE NERVE TO TELL HER?

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:23.612
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

00:19:27.415 --> 00:19:28.784
&gt;&gt; I GOTTA SAY...

00:19:28.784 --> 00:19:32.988
THAT WAS VERY FOOLISH OF YOU.

00:19:32.988 --> 00:19:34.790
YOU THREW AWAY EVERYTHING FOR

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:35.924
YOUR BROTHER’S TWISTED

00:19:35.924 --> 00:19:38.394
VERSION OF LOVE.

00:19:42.999 --> 00:19:46.668
[splash]

00:19:46.668 --> 00:19:48.838
OR MAYBE IT WAS YOUR TWISTED

00:19:48.838 --> 00:19:50.539
LOVE FOR YOUR BROTHER.

00:19:50.539 --> 00:19:52.742
SO THIS CAN’T LOOK GOOD, CAN IT?

00:19:52.742 --> 00:19:53.910
YOU’RE ABOUT TO MERGE WITH THE

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:54.911
NEBRA PEOPLE.

00:19:54.911 --> 00:19:56.045
LET THEM CATCH WIND OF

00:19:56.045 --> 00:19:57.647
SOMETHING LIKE THIS, AND, THE

00:19:57.647 --> 00:19:58.948
NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU’VE GOT

00:19:58.948 --> 00:20:01.518
SOME MAFIA HIT-MAN ON YOUR TAIL.

00:20:01.518 --> 00:20:03.019
THEN AFTER THAT, POW!

00:20:03.019 --> 00:20:04.854
AND CHECKMATE.

00:20:04.854 --> 00:20:06.556
CLEANING CREW?

00:20:06.556 --> 00:20:07.124
&gt;&gt; THAT’S THEM.

00:20:07.124 --> 00:20:09.026
THAT’S THE NORMAL CREW THEY USE.

00:20:09.026 --> 00:20:11.428
&gt;&gt; GOT IT.

00:20:11.428 --> 00:20:13.797
[ringing]

00:20:13.797 --> 00:20:14.531
HELLO.

00:20:14.531 --> 00:20:15.398
THINGS ARE GETTING A LITTLE

00:20:15.398 --> 00:20:16.967
BIT HEATED IN YOUR NECK OF THE

00:20:16.967 --> 00:20:17.735
WOODS.

00:20:17.735 --> 00:20:18.702
YOU SHOULD GET OUT OF THERE

00:20:18.702 --> 00:20:22.372
SOON.

00:20:22.372 --> 00:20:23.807
I WISH THE KING PIECES COULD

00:20:23.807 --> 00:20:25.409
FIGHT EACH OTHER.

00:20:25.409 --> 00:20:27.911
THEY SHOULD CHANGE THAT RULE.

00:20:27.911 --> 00:20:28.879
I’VE GOTTA THINK THAT YOUR

00:20:28.879 --> 00:20:31.081
UNCLE WAS A LOT LIKE ME.

00:20:31.081 --> 00:20:32.783
HE QUESTIONED THE AFTERLIFE

00:20:32.783 --> 00:20:34.017
MORE THAN ANYONE...

00:20:34.017 --> 00:20:36.120
FEARED DEATH MORE THAN ANYONE...

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.155
AND LONGED FOR HEAVEN MORE THAN

00:20:37.155 --> 00:20:38.756
ANYONE.

00:20:38.756 --> 00:20:40.758
BUT THE AFTERLIFE, WELL, THAT I

00:20:40.758 --> 00:20:42.126
BELIEVE IN

00:20:42.126 --> 00:20:44.863
WE’LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT.

00:20:44.863 --> 00:20:46.497
FOR WHATEVER REASON, DULLAHANS

00:20:46.497 --> 00:20:47.899
ARE ALWAYS DEPICTED AS WOMEN IN

00:20:47.899 --> 00:20:49.133
THE LEGENDS.

00:20:49.133 --> 00:20:51.002
DO YOU KNOW WHY THAT IS?

00:20:51.002 --> 00:20:52.003
&gt;&gt; NO, I DON’T.

00:20:52.003 --> 00:20:53.472
MY MEN DID A LITTLE RESEARCH ON

00:20:53.472 --> 00:20:54.839
THE MYTH, BUT, IN THE END, I

00:20:54.839 --> 00:20:56.841
THOUGHT IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME.

00:20:56.841 --> 00:20:58.009
&gt;&gt; YOU’RE ALWAYS THE PRAGMATIC

00:20:58.009 --> 00:20:58.910
ONE.

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:00.979
WELL, SUIT YOURSELF.

00:21:00.979 --> 00:21:02.847
THERE’S A PLACE CALLED VALHALLA.

00:21:02.847 --> 00:21:04.950
IT’S SORT LIKE A HEAVEN.

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:05.750
AND, ACCORDING TO NORDIC

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:07.853
MYTHOLOGY, THE SOUL OF A FALLEN

00:21:07.853 --> 00:21:09.121
WARRIOR IS GUIDED TO VALHALLA

00:21:09.121 --> 00:21:10.589
BY AN ARMORED, FEMALE ANGEL

00:21:10.589 --> 00:21:12.892
KNOWN AS A VALKYRIE.

00:21:12.892 --> 00:21:14.594
A WOMAN WHO COMES TO GREET THE

00:21:14.594 --> 00:21:15.160
DEAD.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.030
DOESN’T THAT SOUND FAMILIAR?

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:19.599
SOME THEORIZE THAT A DULLAHAN

00:21:19.599 --> 00:21:20.933
IS ACTUALLY A VALKYRIE WHO IS

00:21:20.933 --> 00:21:22.902
WANDERING AROUND ON EARTH.

00:21:22.902 --> 00:21:25.505
AND, IF THAT’S TRUE, THEN THIS

00:21:25.505 --> 00:21:27.573
HEAD IS PROBABLY WAITING...

00:21:27.573 --> 00:21:29.775
WAITING TO WAKE UP FOR WAR.

00:21:29.775 --> 00:21:31.044
THEN SHE CAN FIND HER WARRIOR

00:21:31.044 --> 00:21:33.179
AND TAKE HIM TO VALHALLA.

00:21:33.179 --> 00:21:34.948
THAT’S WHY SHE’S ALIVE, BUT WITH

00:21:34.948 --> 00:21:36.116
HER EYES CLOSED, BECAUSE WE

00:21:36.116 --> 00:21:37.984
AREN’T ON A BATTLEFIELD.

00:21:37.984 --> 00:21:40.020
IT’S MY WISH THAT SHE WOULD

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.155
CHOOSE ME AS HER WARRIOR.

00:21:42.155 --> 00:21:43.690
IF THERE TRULY IS A VALHALLA

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:45.091
AWAITING ME AFTER DEATH, HOW

00:21:45.091 --> 00:21:47.027
DO I EVEN PREPARE FOR THIS?

00:21:47.027 --> 00:21:48.094
I MEAN, I KNOW I’M NOT REALLY

00:21:48.094 --> 00:21:50.230
CUT OUT FOR BATTLEFIELD HEROICS.

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:51.865
SO THEN I’LL HAVE TO START A

00:21:51.865 --> 00:21:54.968
WAR THAT ONLY I CAN WIN, RIGHT?

00:21:54.968 --> 00:21:55.969
[laughs]

00:21:55.969 --> 00:21:57.638
AREN’T I THE LUCKY ONE?

00:21:57.638 --> 00:21:58.972
IMAGINE ME, WHO DOESN’T BELIEVE

00:21:58.972 --> 00:22:00.074
IN A HEAVEN, MUCH LESS A

00:22:00.074 --> 00:22:01.842
VIRTUOUS LIFE.

00:22:01.842 --> 00:22:03.510
AND YET I STILL MEET AN ANGEL

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:05.012
OF DEATH WHO’S FALLEN TO EARTH.

00:22:05.012 --> 00:22:06.213
&gt;&gt; WHATEVER.

00:22:06.213 --> 00:22:08.215
THAT’S SIMPLY A THEORY OF YOURS.

00:22:08.215 --> 00:22:09.917
&gt;&gt; WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH WILL BE

00:22:09.917 --> 00:22:10.618
SAVED.

00:22:10.618 --> 00:22:13.087
THIS IS JUST INSURANCE REALLY.

00:22:13.087 --> 00:22:14.656
EVEN IF I DO END UP IN A HELL

00:22:14.656 --> 00:22:16.858
SURROUNDED BY PAIN, AS LONG AS

00:22:16.858 --> 00:22:19.594
I COULD EXIST, I WOULDN’T CARE.

00:22:19.594 --> 00:22:21.963
BUT, THAT SAID, IF IT IS AT ALL

00:22:21.963 --> 00:22:23.498
POSSIBLE, I WOULD STILL PREFER

00:22:23.498 --> 00:22:24.499
HEAVEN.

00:22:24.499 --> 00:22:25.833
HEY, NAMIE.

00:22:25.833 --> 00:22:28.937
WHY DON’T WE ALL GO TO HEAVEN?

00:22:28.937 --> 00:22:30.572
AS A MEMBER OF THE DOLLARS, I’M

00:22:30.572 --> 00:22:32.540
GONNA KEEP THIS HIDING IN PLAIN

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:33.776
SIGHT.

00:22:33.776 --> 00:22:35.010
THE LAST PLACE CELTY IS GOING

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:36.278
TO LOOK FOR HER HEAD IS WITHIN

00:22:36.278 --> 00:22:37.980
THE SAME GANG THAT SHE BELONGS

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:39.147
TO.

00:22:39.147 --> 00:22:40.048
I KNOW!

00:22:40.048 --> 00:22:41.249
YOU SHOULD BECOME PART OF THE

00:22:41.249 --> 00:22:42.551
DOLLARS TOO.

00:22:42.551 --> 00:22:44.019
IT’S A LITTLE KNOWN FACT THAT

00:22:44.019 --> 00:22:45.120
OUR BOSS DOESN’T TURN DOWN

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.221
ANYONE.

00:22:46.221 --> 00:22:48.624
OF COURSE, AFTER A WHILE, I WAS

00:22:48.624 --> 00:22:50.025
THE ONE WHO WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN

00:22:50.025 --> 00:22:51.960
GATHERING PEOPLE.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.130
I SAY WE GIVE THIS FALLEN ANGEL

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:57.133
A PAIR OF WINGS AGAIN.

00:22:57.133 --> 00:22:59.135
WHAT DO YA THINK?

00:22:59.135 --> 00:23:02.138
