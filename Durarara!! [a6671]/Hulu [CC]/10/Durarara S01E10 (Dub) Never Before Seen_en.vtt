00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:31.057
THE ONLY KIDS WHO SMOKE CIGS

00:07:31.057 --> 00:07:33.025
ON ROOFTOPS ARE THE ONES IN SOME

00:07:33.025 --> 00:07:34.193

00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:38.230
THE DOLLARS?"

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:39.164
HE’S NOT GONNA TELL US THE

00:07:39.164 --> 00:07:41.032
TRUTH ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:07:41.032 --> 00:07:42.668
&gt;&gt; YOU JUST LEAVE THAT TO ME.

00:07:42.668 --> 00:07:46.204
I’VE GOT A PLAN.

00:07:46.204 --> 00:07:48.239

SO WHAT’S GOIN’ ON?

00:08:04.121 --> 00:08:05.222

&gt;&gt; I GOT A QUESTION.

00:08:07.057 --> 00:08:08.258
&gt;&gt; GO FOR IT.

00:08:08.258 --> 00:08:09.693
&gt;&gt; [clears throat]

00:08:09.693 --> 00:08:11.128
YOU A MEMBER OF THE DOLLARS OR

00:08:11.128 --> 00:08:11.795

00:08:11.795 --> 00:08:13.397
&gt;&gt; MASAOMI, WHAT ARE YOU--

&gt;&gt; YEAH, I’M IN WITH THEM.

00:08:14.331 --> 00:08:15.199
&gt;&gt; AAHH!

00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:17.234
&gt;&gt; THOUGHT SO.

00:08:17.234 --> 00:08:19.168
IN FACT, I HAD NO DOUBT AT ALL.

00:08:19.168 --> 00:08:23.039

00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:24.941

&gt;&gt; YEAH, I’M MIKADO RYUGAMINE.

00:08:28.777 --> 00:08:30.146
&gt;&gt; OH, YOU’RE THAT GUY.

00:08:30.146 --> 00:08:31.080
YOU’RE FAMOUS.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.748
&gt;&gt; HUH? I AM?

00:08:32.748 --> 00:08:33.949
&gt;&gt; JUST YOUR NAME.

00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:35.384
&gt;&gt; OH.

&gt;&gt; WANT SOME?

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:38.286
&gt;&gt; SURE, THANK YOU.

00:08:38.286 --> 00:08:39.221
&gt;&gt; HMM?

00:08:39.221 --> 00:08:43.291
&gt;&gt; THANKS, MAN.

00:08:43.291 --> 00:08:44.827
&gt;&gt; SO, TAKIGUCHI, I GOT A

00:08:44.827 --> 00:08:45.293
QUESTION.

00:08:45.293 --> 00:08:46.128
&gt;&gt; HMM?

00:08:46.128 --> 00:08:47.863
&gt;&gt; WHAT MADE YOU JOIN THE

00:08:47.863 --> 00:08:48.763
DOLLARS?

00:08:48.763 --> 00:08:50.265
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:08:50.265 --> 00:08:51.966
HMM.

00:08:51.966 --> 00:08:53.000
I’M NOT REALLY SURE EXACTLY

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.070
WHY I DECIDED TO DO IT.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.039
I THINK IT WAS SIX MONTHS AGO.

00:08:58.039 --> 00:08:59.674
I GOT AN EMAIL FROM SOME GUY I

00:08:59.674 --> 00:09:00.808
DIDN’T EVEN KNOW.

00:09:00.808 --> 00:09:02.209
HE MENTIONED THE DOLLARS AND

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:03.244
SAID THEY DIDN’T HAVE ANY KIND

00:09:03.244 --> 00:09:05.446
OF RULES OR CONDITIONS.

00:09:05.446 --> 00:09:06.814
MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS, YEAH,

00:09:06.814 --> 00:09:07.915
RIGHT.

00:09:07.915 --> 00:09:08.882
BUT THEN I THOUGHT, IF THERE

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:10.117
WAS A GROUP LIKE THAT, I’D

00:09:10.117 --> 00:09:13.287
WANT TO BE A PART OF IT.

00:09:13.287 --> 00:09:15.456
TRUTH IS, LAST THING I WANT IS

00:09:15.456 --> 00:09:17.157
TO BE BOSSED AROUND OR VICE

00:09:17.157 --> 00:09:18.992
VERSA.

00:09:18.992 --> 00:09:20.293
&gt;&gt; SO, WHAT ARE THE DOLLARS

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:20.961
LIKE?

00:09:20.961 --> 00:09:22.128
FILL US IN.

00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:23.697
&gt;&gt; WELL, GUESS I’D SAY

00:09:23.697 --> 00:09:26.066
TRANSPARENT, AS IN NO COLOR.

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:27.233
&gt;&gt; TRANSPARENT?

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:28.801
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:30.270
THEY’RE NOT LIKE THE OTHER GUYS.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.304
THE YELLOW SCARVES AND BLUE

00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:32.272
SQUARES WERE ALL ABOUT SHOWIN’

00:09:32.272 --> 00:09:33.339
YOUR COLORS AND GETTIN’ INTO

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:34.707
TURF WARS, BUT THE DOLLARS

00:09:34.707 --> 00:09:35.841
AREN’T INTO THAT.

00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:37.276
&gt;&gt; WHO WERE THE BLUE SQUARES?

00:09:37.276 --> 00:09:38.978
&gt;&gt; THEY WERE A COLOR GANG THAT

00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:39.945
WAS A BIG DEAL WHEN I WAS IN

00:09:39.945 --> 00:09:41.346
MIDDLE SCHOOL.

00:09:41.346 --> 00:09:42.748
I DON’T KNOW THE DETAILS, BUT

00:09:42.748 --> 00:09:44.249
THEY GOT INTO SOME TROUBLE AND

00:09:44.249 --> 00:09:46.818
THEN FELL APART.

00:09:46.818 --> 00:09:48.153
&gt;&gt; MASAOMI?

00:09:48.153 --> 00:09:49.754
&gt;&gt; SO THEN, YOU’RE TELLING US

00:09:49.754 --> 00:09:51.356
THAT YOU LIKE THE DOLLARS?

00:09:51.356 --> 00:09:52.291
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:53.392
&gt;&gt; YOU EVER GET TOGETHER WITH

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:54.393
THE OTHER MEMBERS?

00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:56.094
&gt;&gt; WELL, MEMBERS ONLY KNOW EACH

00:09:56.094 --> 00:09:57.862
OTHER BY THEIR USERNAMES.

00:09:57.862 --> 00:09:59.097
BUT, YEAH, I’VE MET A BUNCH OF

00:09:59.097 --> 00:09:59.798
’EM.

00:09:59.798 --> 00:10:01.800
EITHER AT WORK OR IN TOWN.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.301
JUST BY ACCIDENT.

00:10:03.301 --> 00:10:04.402
IF YOU THINK, "I BET HE’S WITH

00:10:04.402 --> 00:10:05.904
THE DOLLARS," TURNS OUT THEY

00:10:05.904 --> 00:10:07.005
USUALLY ARE.

00:10:07.005 --> 00:10:08.139
&gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU TELL BY LOOKING

00:10:08.139 --> 00:10:08.906
AT THEM?

00:10:08.906 --> 00:10:09.473
&gt;&gt; I DON’T KNOW.

00:10:09.473 --> 00:10:10.408
IT’S HARD TO EXPLAIN.

00:10:10.408 --> 00:10:11.475
JUST ASK ’EM.

00:10:11.475 --> 00:10:12.876
I THINK MOST GUYS YOU ASK

00:10:12.876 --> 00:10:17.147
WOULD ADMIT IT STRAIGHT UP.

00:10:17.147 --> 00:10:18.315
[alarm rings]

00:10:18.315 --> 00:10:19.316
WELL, THAT BLOWS.

00:10:19.316 --> 00:10:22.419
&gt;&gt; SEE YA, SUCKERS!

00:10:22.419 --> 00:10:23.787

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:29.892
SECRET AND NEVER TELL ANYONE.

00:10:29.892 --> 00:10:31.027
I DON’T KNOW HIM, BUT I’M

00:10:31.027 --> 00:10:32.329
GUESSING HE WOULDN’T WANT

00:10:32.329 --> 00:10:33.430
PEOPLE TO MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:34.230
OF IT.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.197
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, CLASS.

00:10:35.197 --> 00:10:36.098
&gt;&gt; I FIGURE IF ANYONE WANTS

00:10:36.098 --> 00:10:38.167
TO KNOW, THEY CAN ASK HIM.

00:10:38.167 --> 00:10:40.202
STAND.

00:10:40.202 --> 00:10:42.004
BOW.

00:10:47.243 --> 00:10:48.410
&gt;&gt; OKAY, THAT’S IT FOR THE CLASS

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:50.312
REPS MEETING.

00:10:50.312 --> 00:10:51.880
&gt;&gt; I WONDER IF MASAOMI’S HALL

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.415
MONITOR MEETING IS OVER.

00:10:53.415 --> 00:10:54.816
&gt;&gt; HMM.

00:10:54.816 --> 00:10:55.851
WELL, IF IT ISN’T, IT SHOULD

00:10:55.851 --> 00:10:57.252
BE OVER PRETTY SOON.

00:10:57.252 --> 00:11:01.990
[girls giggling]

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.291
&gt;&gt; MIKA HARIMA, THE GIRL WHO

00:11:03.291 --> 00:11:05.526
WAS STALKING SEIJI YAGIRI, HAS

00:11:05.526 --> 00:11:07.062
BEEN MISSING EVEN BEFORE SCHOOL

00:11:07.062 --> 00:11:08.028
STARTED.

00:11:08.028 --> 00:11:09.964
SO HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING NEW

00:11:09.964 --> 00:11:11.299

00:11:11.299 --> 00:11:13.901
&gt;&gt; NO. NOTHING.

00:11:13.901 --> 00:11:16.804
&gt;&gt; HEY, MIKADO!

00:11:16.804 --> 00:11:18.138
MASAOMI SAID FOR YOU TO GO

00:11:18.138 --> 00:11:19.539
HOME WITHOUT HIM.

00:11:19.539 --> 00:11:20.808
&gt;&gt; HUH? WHY?

00:11:20.808 --> 00:11:21.909
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

00:11:21.909 --> 00:11:23.911
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YEAH, THE HALL MONITORS

00:11:23.911 --> 00:11:25.345
ARE JUST HAVING A HUGE ARGUMENT

00:11:25.345 --> 00:11:26.213
RIGHT NOW.

00:11:26.213 --> 00:11:27.414
IT’S ALL GOOD.

00:11:27.414 --> 00:11:30.484
SEE YA!

00:11:30.484 --> 00:11:32.852
&gt;&gt; WELL, THEN, ARE YOU READY

00:11:32.852 --> 00:11:33.887
TO GO?

00:11:33.887 --> 00:11:39.058
&gt;&gt; SURE.

00:11:39.058 --> 00:11:40.359
&gt;&gt; I WONDER WHAT’S SO

00:11:40.359 --> 00:11:41.594
IMPORTANT THAT MASAOMI WOULD

00:11:41.594 --> 00:11:43.229
STAY LATE TO ARGUE ABOUT IT.

00:11:43.229 --> 00:11:44.230
YOU KNOW, IT’S PROBABLY JUST

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.963
LIKE CLOTHES AND...

00:11:44.963 --> 00:11:47.133
&gt;&gt; MIKADO!

00:11:47.133 --> 00:11:48.133
DON’T SCREW IT UP WITH THAT

00:11:48.133 --> 00:11:49.935
FINE CHICA.

00:11:49.935 --> 00:11:51.036
AND NEXT TIME YOU HAVE TO

00:11:51.036 --> 00:11:52.905
INTRODUCE ME.

00:11:52.905 --> 00:11:55.541
PEACE OUT. LATER!

00:11:55.541 --> 00:11:58.276
&gt;&gt; UH...

00:11:58.276 --> 00:12:00.212
UH, HE MEANT MISS FINECHICA.

00:12:00.212 --> 00:12:01.613
IT’S THIS FRENCH GIRL WE MET

00:12:01.613 --> 00:12:03.248
AT THAT RUSSIA SUSHI PLACE.

00:12:03.248 --> 00:12:05.517
AND UH, SH-SH-SHE’S GOT--GOT

00:12:05.517 --> 00:12:07.084
A NOSE RING!

00:12:07.084 --> 00:12:08.186
I’M SURE THAT’S WHAT HE’S BEEN

00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:09.587
ARGUING ABOUT, WHETHER OR NOT

00:12:09.587 --> 00:12:10.988
THEY SHOULD ALLOW NOSE RINGS AT

00:12:10.988 --> 00:12:11.556
SCHOOL.

00:12:11.556 --> 00:12:14.158
[laughs]

00:12:14.158 --> 00:12:15.927
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I’VE KINDA KNOWN

00:12:15.927 --> 00:12:17.094
WHO YOU WERE LONG BEFORE YOU

00:12:17.094 --> 00:12:19.130
AND I EVEN MET IN CLASS.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:19.997
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:12:19.997 --> 00:12:21.132
&gt;&gt; WHEN I CAME TO THE SCHOOL TO

00:12:21.132 --> 00:12:23.100
REGISTER, I SAW A LIST OF

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.035
NAMES ON A DESK AS I WAS

00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:26.103
HANDING IN MY PAPERWORK.

00:12:26.103 --> 00:12:26.937
I NOTICED ONE OF THE NAMES

00:12:26.937 --> 00:12:27.971
RIGHT AWAY.

00:12:27.971 --> 00:12:28.905
I THOUGHT IT WAS COOL.

00:12:28.905 --> 00:12:29.973
THE GUY WITH THAT NAME WAS

00:12:29.973 --> 00:12:31.575
RIGHT NEXT TO ME.

00:12:31.575 --> 00:12:33.510
AND THEN NEXT THING I KNOW, HE

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:35.111
AND I ENDED UP BEING CLASS REPS

00:12:35.111 --> 00:12:35.545
TOGETHER.

00:12:35.545 --> 00:12:36.246
&gt;&gt; WAIT A SECOND!

00:12:36.246 --> 00:12:37.247
ISN’T THIS SORT OF LIKE WHAT

00:12:37.247 --> 00:12:38.414
HER FRIEND MIKA DID TO THAT

00:12:38.414 --> 00:12:39.549
SEIJI GUY?

00:12:39.549 --> 00:12:41.884
OH, MAN. IS SHE A STALKER?

00:12:41.884 --> 00:12:43.353
HOLD ON, IF SHE’S CUTE, MAYBE

00:12:43.353 --> 00:12:44.920
IT’S OKAY.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.055
NO, NO, NO.

00:12:46.055 --> 00:12:47.122
THIS IS STILL BAD.

00:12:47.122 --> 00:12:51.527
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS...

00:12:51.527 --> 00:12:52.394
&gt;&gt; I WANT YOU NOW!

00:12:52.394 --> 00:12:54.597
&gt;&gt; SHE COULD TOTALLY STAB ME!

00:12:54.597 --> 00:12:55.898
OR SHE MIGHT EVEN SET MY PLACE

00:12:55.898 --> 00:12:57.266
ON FIRE!

00:12:57.266 --> 00:12:59.134
HOLD ON, WHAT IF SHE TAKES MY

00:12:59.134 --> 00:13:00.970
PARENTS HOSTAGE?

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:01.971
BUT IF SHE’S A GOOD PERSON,

00:13:01.971 --> 00:13:03.905
MAYBE I DON’T MIND HER STALKING

00:13:03.905 --> 00:13:04.939
ME.

00:13:04.939 --> 00:13:06.140
WHAT AM I SAYING?

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.309
IF SHE’S STALKING ME, THEN SHE

00:13:07.309 --> 00:13:08.943
CAN’T BE A GOOD PERSON!

00:13:08.943 --> 00:13:10.612
&gt;&gt; I WAS JUST KIDDING.

00:13:10.612 --> 00:13:12.013
BESIDES, YOU WOULDN’T WANT

00:13:12.013 --> 00:13:13.281
SOMEONE LIKE ME HANGING AROUND

00:13:13.281 --> 00:13:14.683
ALL THE TIME.

00:13:14.683 --> 00:13:15.984
&gt;&gt; NO, I...

00:13:15.984 --> 00:13:17.551
&gt;&gt; I KNOW THAT SOUNDED WEIRD.

00:13:17.551 --> 00:13:18.586
BUT DON’T WORRY, I’M NOT A

00:13:18.586 --> 00:13:19.988
STALKER OR ANYTHING.

00:13:19.988 --> 00:13:21.555
&gt;&gt; NO, I DIDN’T--

00:13:21.555 --> 00:13:23.291
WELL, I...

00:13:23.291 --> 00:13:24.358
I’M SORRY.

00:13:24.358 --> 00:13:26.159
&gt;&gt; HUH. NO, IT’S FINE.

00:13:26.159 --> 00:13:27.461
I WAS THE ONE WHO STARTED IT BY

00:13:27.461 --> 00:13:28.429
TEASING YOU.

00:13:28.429 --> 00:13:32.132
THERE’S NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE.

00:13:32.132 --> 00:13:34.067
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.

00:13:34.067 --> 00:13:36.569
WELL, LISTEN, I’M--I’M GLAD

00:13:36.569 --> 00:13:38.038

00:13:38.038 --> 00:13:39.506
&gt;&gt; I’M GLAD WE BECAME FRIENDS

00:13:39.506 --> 00:13:41.341

00:13:47.213 --> 00:13:48.114
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:13:48.114 --> 00:13:49.115
&gt;&gt; YEAH, IT’S BEEN A LOT OF FUN.

00:13:49.115 --> 00:13:50.049
&gt;&gt; [exclaims]

00:13:50.049 --> 00:13:51.083
TAKESHI, THAT’S HIM.

00:13:51.083 --> 00:13:55.487
THAT’S THE LOSER. LOOK!

00:13:55.487 --> 00:13:57.957
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:13:57.957 --> 00:14:00.092

00:14:00.092 --> 00:14:02.294
IT’S NOT ME, RIGHT?

00:14:07.065 --> 00:14:08.299

00:14:08.299 --> 00:14:09.468

&gt;&gt; SORRY, BUT I REALLY HAVE NO

00:14:21.746 --> 00:14:24.482

00:14:24.482 --> 00:14:27.452
OH.

00:14:27.452 --> 00:14:29.253

LESSON ABOUT WHERE YOU BELONG

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.076

00:14:53.076 --> 00:14:56.012
HUH?

00:14:56.012 --> 00:15:00.183

&gt;&gt; [laughing]

00:15:07.523 --> 00:15:09.224
ARE YOU EXPLOITING MY RULE

00:15:09.224 --> 00:15:11.026
AGAINST HITTING WOMEN?

00:15:11.026 --> 00:15:13.061
WHAT A CLEVER GIRL YOU ARE.

00:15:13.061 --> 00:15:14.362
I WOULD ASK YOU OUT.

00:15:14.362 --> 00:15:17.799
HOWEVER, YOU’RE SO NOT MY TYPE.

&gt;&gt; WHAT IS IT?

00:16:46.717 --> 00:16:50.153
&gt;&gt; SO IT CAN COMMUNICATE.

00:16:50.153 --> 00:16:52.122
WELL, I-I WAS JUST WONDERING

00:16:52.122 --> 00:16:54.524
WHAT YOU ARE.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:02.599
&gt;&gt; I’M LOOKING FOR A GIRL.

00:17:02.599 --> 00:17:03.900
SHE’S A RELATIVE OF MINE WHO’S

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:04.734
GONE MISSING.

00:17:04.734 --> 00:17:05.868
I FOUND HER YESTERDAY, BUT THEN

00:17:05.868 --> 00:17:08.537
SHE RAN AWAY FOR SOME REASON.

00:17:08.537 --> 00:17:10.840
&gt;&gt; IT’S A TERRIBLE LIAR.

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.275
UM, I’M SORRY, BUT I DON’T

00:17:13.275 --> 00:17:17.646
BELIEVE YOU.

00:17:17.646 --> 00:17:19.180
&gt;&gt; HOW MUCH DO YOU REALLY KNOW

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.616
ABOUT ME?

00:17:20.616 --> 00:17:22.618
&gt;&gt; WELL, I-I JUST KNOW WHAT THE

00:17:22.618 --> 00:17:24.152
URBAN LEGEND SAYS--

00:17:24.152 --> 00:17:25.353
THAT YOU RIDE AROUND ON THIS

00:17:25.353 --> 00:17:26.621
BIKE WITH NO HEADLIGHT AND NO

00:17:26.621 --> 00:17:29.290
ACTUAL MOTOR SOUNDS.

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:31.826
AND THAT...

00:17:31.826 --> 00:17:32.860
THAT YOU DON’T REALLY HAVE A

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.664
HEAD.

00:17:36.664 --> 00:17:37.832
&gt;&gt; AND DO YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE

00:17:37.832 --> 00:17:41.401
THIS?

00:17:41.401 --> 00:17:42.803
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, YOU COULD ALWAYS

00:17:42.803 --> 00:17:44.772
SHOW ME WHAT’S INSIDE YOUR

00:17:44.772 --> 00:17:46.206
HELMET.

00:17:46.206 --> 00:17:47.507
THAT WAS PRETTY SHOCKING,

00:17:47.507 --> 00:17:48.308
EVEN FOR ME.

00:17:48.308 --> 00:17:49.309
I DIDN’T THINK I’D HAVE THE

00:17:49.309 --> 00:17:49.843
GUTS TO SAY THAT.

00:17:49.843 --> 00:17:50.810
&gt;&gt; PROMISE ME THAT YOU WON’T

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:53.213
SCREAM?

00:17:53.213 --> 00:17:54.714
&gt;&gt; BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I

00:17:54.714 --> 00:17:56.216
FELT LIKE I’D BEEN WAITING FOR

00:17:56.216 --> 00:17:57.517
A MOMENT LIKE THIS TO OCCUR

00:17:57.517 --> 00:18:02.288
FOR YEARS.

00:18:02.288 --> 00:18:03.590
I STILL CAN’T DESCRIBE HOW I

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:06.259
FELT AT THAT EXACT MOMENT.

00:18:06.259 --> 00:18:07.526
I JUST FOUND MYSELF THINKING,

00:18:07.526 --> 00:18:10.529
"I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT!", OVER

00:18:10.529 --> 00:18:13.299
AND OVER AGAIN.

00:18:13.299 --> 00:18:15.334
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:18:19.337 --> 00:18:20.906
AFTER THAT, THE BLACK RIDER

00:18:20.906 --> 00:18:22.575
TOLD ME EVERYTHING--LIKE THE

00:18:22.575 --> 00:18:23.976
REAL REASON IT WAS LOOKING FOR

00:18:23.976 --> 00:18:26.311
THAT GIRL YESTERDAY.

00:18:26.311 --> 00:18:27.412
IT TOLD ME IT WAS A DULLAHAN

00:18:27.412 --> 00:18:28.914
NAMED CELTY.

00:18:28.914 --> 00:18:29.948
THAT SHE’D COME TO JAPAN IN

00:18:29.948 --> 00:18:30.983
SEARCH OF HER HEAD THAT HAD BEEN

00:18:30.983 --> 00:18:32.217
STOLEN.

00:18:32.217 --> 00:18:33.685
AND WHEN CELTY SAW THE GIRL WITH

00:18:33.685 --> 00:18:35.487
STITCHES ON HER NECK, HER FACE

00:18:35.487 --> 00:18:37.955
LOOKED JUST LIKE HER OWN.

00:18:37.955 --> 00:18:38.890
NORMALLY, I WOULD NEVER BELIEVE

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:40.892
A STORY LIKE THAT, BUT FOR

00:18:40.892 --> 00:18:42.827
SOME REASON, SITTING THERE WITH

00:18:42.827 --> 00:18:45.396
HER, I FELT LIKE I COULD.

00:18:45.396 --> 00:18:46.697
&gt;&gt; SO, ARE YOU FRIENDS WITH THIS

00:18:46.697 --> 00:18:47.631
GIRL?

00:18:47.631 --> 00:18:48.465
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:18:48.465 --> 00:18:49.666
ACTUALLY, YESTERDAY WAS THE

00:18:49.666 --> 00:18:51.001
FIRST TIME THAT I EVER MET HER.

00:18:51.001 --> 00:18:52.002
I ASKED HER A LOT OF

00:18:52.002 --> 00:18:53.704
QUESTIONS, BUT SHE TOLD ME

00:18:53.704 --> 00:18:54.905
THAT SHE’D LOST ALL HER

00:18:54.905 --> 00:18:57.007
MEMORIES AND...

00:18:57.007 --> 00:19:01.344
MISS CELTY?

00:19:01.344 --> 00:19:02.245
&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO LET

00:19:02.245 --> 00:19:03.613
ME SEE HER?

00:19:03.613 --> 00:19:05.281
&gt;&gt; WELL, I DON’T KNOW.

00:19:05.281 --> 00:19:06.582
I MEAN, SHE DOES SEEM PRETTY

FREAKED OUT BY YOU.

00:19:07.617 --> 00:19:08.884
YOU DID CHASE HER DOWN KIND

00:19:08.884 --> 00:19:14.590
OF HARD YESTERDAY.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:16.526
&gt;&gt; I NEED TO SEE THIS GIRL, NO

00:19:16.526 --> 00:19:17.960
MATTER WHAT.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.894
MAYBE YOU CAN CLEAR UP ANY

00:19:18.894 --> 00:19:23.365
FALSE IMPRESSIONS?

00:19:23.365 --> 00:19:25.835
&gt;&gt; I’LL DO MY BEST.
