00:09:18.482 --> 00:09:19.416
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE I’M ABOUT TO DO

00:09:19.416 --> 00:09:21.484
SOMETHING AWFUL TO YOU.

00:09:21.484 --> 00:09:24.586
BUT NOW AT LEAST WE’RE EVEN.

00:09:24.586 --> 00:09:26.520
WHAT I’M ABOUT TO DO IS ALLOW

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.523
MY SAIKA TO CONTROL YOUR MIND.

00:09:29.523 --> 00:09:31.591
I WON’T APOLOGIZE.

00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:33.158
IF I DID, IT WOULD INVALIDATE

00:09:33.158 --> 00:09:34.526
EVERYTHING I’VE DONE MY ENTIRE

00:09:34.526 --> 00:09:36.127
LIFE.

00:09:36.127 --> 00:09:37.528
I KNOW THIS MAY SEEM A BIT

00:09:37.528 --> 00:09:38.896
DEVIOUS.

00:09:38.896 --> 00:09:40.530
BUT I WILL HAVE PEACE IN MY

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.465
LIFE, EVEN IF I MUST USE YOU

00:09:42.465 --> 00:09:45.467
IN A HORRIBLE WAY TO GET IT.

00:09:45.467 --> 00:09:48.836
YOU SEE, I HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE.

00:09:48.836 --> 00:09:52.505
I TRULY AM A PARASITE.

00:09:52.505 --> 00:09:54.140
&gt;&gt; [gasps]

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.574
&gt;&gt; I LOVE YOU! I LOVE YOU!

00:09:55.574 --> 00:09:56.474
&gt;&gt; SAIKA IS SUCH A LONELY

00:09:56.474 --> 00:09:58.610
CREATURE.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:59.510
I KNOW FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.345
WHAT SHE’S DOING MAY SEEM WRONG.

00:10:02.345 --> 00:10:03.946
BUT SHE DOES GENUINELY LOVE

00:10:03.946 --> 00:10:06.115
HUMANS.

00:10:06.115 --> 00:10:08.016
SO NOW IT’S YOUR TURN...

00:10:08.016 --> 00:10:09.383
IT’S TIME FOR YOU TO LOVE SAIKA

00:10:09.383 --> 00:10:11.084
TOO.

00:10:11.084 --> 00:10:13.586
UNLIKE ME, YOU HAVE THE ABILITY

00:10:13.586 --> 00:10:16.188
TO LOVE OTHER PEOPLE.

00:10:21.492 --> 00:10:26.995
&gt;&gt; [roars]

00:10:26.995 --> 00:10:29.464
STOP!

00:10:29.464 --> 00:10:31.499
COME ON, STOP, DAMN IT!

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.038
&gt;&gt; [whimpers]

00:10:40.038 --> 00:10:41.606
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

00:10:41.606 --> 00:10:42.340
&gt;&gt; WHERE ARE WE?

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:43.141
&gt;&gt; WHAT’S GOING ON?

00:10:43.141 --> 00:10:44.341
&gt;&gt; THIS IS REALLY CREEPY.

00:10:44.341 --> 00:10:46.576
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

00:10:46.576 --> 00:10:50.111
&gt;&gt; NO ONE ENDED UP DYING, HUH?

00:10:50.111 --> 00:10:55.615
[laughs]

00:10:55.615 --> 00:10:58.417
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:10:58.417 --> 00:11:00.085
&gt;&gt; WELL, BODY...

00:11:00.085 --> 00:11:02.020
I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO CONTROL

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:05.489
YOU.

00:11:05.489 --> 00:11:08.558
&gt;&gt; ANRI, IS THAT REALLY YOU?

00:11:08.558 --> 00:11:09.559
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:11:09.559 --> 00:11:10.493
&gt;&gt; THAT ISN’T THE FIRST TIME

00:11:10.493 --> 00:11:11.560
THAT GIRL’S COME AFTER ME WITH A

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.627
KNIFE.

00:11:12.627 --> 00:11:13.628
LAST TIME I JUST PLAYED IT DOWN

00:11:13.628 --> 00:11:15.363
AND HAD HER TRANSFERRED.

00:11:15.363 --> 00:11:16.564
I GUESS SHE STILL HADN’T--

00:11:16.564 --> 00:11:19.098
[ghost horse neighing]

00:11:25.303 --> 00:11:27.171
ANRI, WE NEED TO GET OUT OF

00:11:27.171 --> 00:11:28.472
HERE.

00:11:28.472 --> 00:11:30.539
LOOK, ANRI, I’VE DONE A WHOLE

00:11:30.539 --> 00:11:32.074
LOT TO TRY AND HELP YOU OUT.

00:11:32.074 --> 00:11:33.541
DID YOU FORGET?

00:11:33.541 --> 00:11:34.442
WHO DO YOU THINK MADE IT

00:11:34.442 --> 00:11:35.543
POSSIBLE FOR YOU AND MIKA TO GET

00:11:35.543 --> 00:11:36.644
IN THE SAME CLASS?

00:11:36.644 --> 00:11:37.611
&gt;&gt; AND THAT DEBT HAS ALREADY

00:11:37.611 --> 00:11:38.945
BEEN REPAID.

00:11:38.945 --> 00:11:39.913
&gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU MEAN?

00:11:39.913 --> 00:11:41.914
REPAID HOW?

00:11:41.914 --> 00:11:43.615
&gt;&gt; AT FIRST, I THOUGHT THE BLACK

00:11:43.615 --> 00:11:46.150
RIDER WAS THE SLASHER.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:47.518
AND FOR A WHILE, I THOUGHT YOU

00:11:47.518 --> 00:11:49.119
MIGHT BE ATTACKED NEXT.

00:11:49.119 --> 00:11:50.620
I WANTED TO HELP.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.322
SO I TRIED MY BEST TO PROTECT

00:11:52.322 --> 00:11:53.622
YOU.

00:11:53.622 --> 00:11:54.923
I WASN’T DOING IT BECAUSE I

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:56.191
LIKE YOU.

00:11:56.191 --> 00:11:57.525
I WAS SIMPLY DOING IT BECAUSE I

00:11:57.525 --> 00:11:59.627
DIDN’T WANT TO OWE YOU ANYTHING.

00:11:59.627 --> 00:12:00.694
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:12:00.694 --> 00:12:02.295
&gt;&gt; I KNOW THE BLACK RIDER WAS

00:12:02.295 --> 00:12:03.662
CHASING YOU, BUT I DON’T KNOW

00:12:03.662 --> 00:12:04.630
WHAT FOR.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.099
WHAT DID YOU DO TO PROVOKE HER?

00:12:07.099 --> 00:12:10.701
&gt;&gt; HE’S THE GUY FROM THAT NIGHT.

00:12:10.701 --> 00:12:13.236
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO...

00:12:13.236 --> 00:12:14.637
ANRI! OKAY...

00:12:14.637 --> 00:12:18.473
THERE’S NO NEED TO HURT ANYONE.

00:12:18.473 --> 00:12:19.640
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO, HUH?

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.242
CUT ME LIKE HARUNA DID?

00:12:21.242 --> 00:12:22.609
PUT THAT BLADE DOWN!

00:12:22.609 --> 00:12:23.576
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:24.644
I COULDN’T BE LIKE HARUNA IF

00:12:24.644 --> 00:12:26.578
I TRIED.

00:12:26.578 --> 00:12:28.279
YOU SEE, WHILE HARUNA LIKED

00:12:28.279 --> 00:12:32.382
YOU, I DETEST YOU.

00:12:32.382 --> 00:12:36.652
&gt;&gt; [screams]

00:12:44.525 --> 00:12:45.726
[upbeat Japanese music]

00:12:45.726 --> 00:12:47.227
&gt;&gt; SHE’S FLAT-CHESTED AND

00:12:47.227 --> 00:12:48.994
PREPUBESCENT!

00:12:48.994 --> 00:12:49.494
[giggles]

00:12:49.494 --> 00:12:51.229
HEY, BY THE WAY, DO YOU KNOW

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:52.496
WHAT DENGEKI BUNKO’S PUTTIN’

00:12:52.496 --> 00:12:54.998
OUT THIS MONTH?

00:12:54.998 --> 00:12:55.665
&gt;&gt; NO MORE BAD BEHAVIOR IN

00:12:55.665 --> 00:12:57.133
THIS VAN, IT’LL STICK OUT

00:12:57.133 --> 00:12:58.267
ANYWHERE.

00:12:58.267 --> 00:12:59.535
&gt;&gt; HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT, I

00:12:59.535 --> 00:13:01.302
WONDER IF <i>KINO’S JOURNEY</i> IS

00:13:01.302 --> 00:13:02.470
EVER GONNA ADD ANOTHER CHAPTER

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:03.338
TO IT.

00:13:03.338 --> 00:13:04.304
&gt;&gt; YEAH, AND CALL IT SOMETHING

00:13:04.304 --> 00:13:05.472
LIKE <i>SHIZU’S JOURNEY!</i>

00:13:05.472 --> 00:13:06.440
&gt;&gt; EVEN BETTER, <i>"SAMOEDO KAMEN</i>

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.374
<i>SHOULDN’T BE THIS CUTE!"</i>

00:13:07.374 --> 00:13:08.341
&gt;&gt; SHOULD’VE KNOWN BETTER THAN

00:13:08.341 --> 00:13:09.375
TO LET WALKER HANDLE REPLACING

00:13:09.375 --> 00:13:11.143
THE DOOR, MAN.

00:13:11.143 --> 00:13:12.344
DAMN IT.

00:13:12.344 --> 00:13:13.511
&gt;&gt; SABURO, WHY’S YOUR FACE SO

00:13:13.511 --> 00:13:14.311
RED?

00:13:14.311 --> 00:13:15.979
&gt;&gt; YOU GOT A FEVER OR SOMETHING?

00:13:15.979 --> 00:13:19.582
&gt;&gt; SHUT UP!

00:13:19.582 --> 00:13:20.983
&gt;&gt; ANRI, ARE YOU SURE YOU’RE

00:13:20.983 --> 00:13:22.084
OKAY?

00:13:22.084 --> 00:13:24.552
&gt;&gt; YEAH, IT REALLY ISN’T THAT

00:13:24.552 --> 00:13:25.353
BAD.

00:13:25.353 --> 00:13:26.487
&gt;&gt; WHEN MASAOMI TOLD ME WHAT

00:13:26.487 --> 00:13:28.421
HAPPENED, I WAS SHOCKED.

00:13:28.421 --> 00:13:30.222
I CAN’T BELIEVE YOU WERE HURT.

00:13:30.222 --> 00:13:32.591
SO WHERE IS MASAOMI ANYWAY?

00:13:32.591 --> 00:13:35.093
&gt;&gt; HE LEFT A LITTLE BIT AGO.

00:13:35.093 --> 00:13:36.327
SAID HE HAD SOMETHING TO TAKE

00:13:36.327 --> 00:13:37.061
CARE OF.

00:13:37.061 --> 00:13:37.728
&gt;&gt; MAN, WHAT COULD BE SO

00:13:37.728 --> 00:13:39.463
IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW?

00:13:39.463 --> 00:13:40.329
&gt;&gt; I’M FINE.

00:13:40.329 --> 00:13:41.330
HE DIDN’T NEED TO STAY.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:42.365
&gt;&gt; SO HAVE YOU TALKED TO THE

00:13:42.365 --> 00:13:43.231
POLICE YET?

00:13:43.231 --> 00:13:44.299
FROM WHAT I HEARD, THERE WERE A

00:13:44.299 --> 00:13:45.300
WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ENDED

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.434
UP GETTING HURT AND...

00:13:46.434 --> 00:13:47.534
&gt;&gt; NO, IT’S OKAY.

00:13:47.534 --> 00:13:49.202
&gt;&gt; IT’S NOT OKAY!

00:13:49.202 --> 00:13:50.403
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE ATTACKS ARE OVER

00:13:50.403 --> 00:13:52.104
NOW.

00:13:52.104 --> 00:13:53.639
I JUST HAVE THAT FEELING.

00:13:53.639 --> 00:13:55.174
&gt;&gt; AND WHY’S THAT?

00:13:55.174 --> 00:13:55.774
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

00:13:55.774 --> 00:13:57.708
OH, I SHOULDN’T LAUGH.

00:13:57.708 --> 00:13:59.309
THE TRUTH IS, SEVERAL HOURS

00:13:59.309 --> 00:14:01.378
BEFORE I GOT HURT, I HAD

00:14:01.378 --> 00:14:02.245
ANOTHER RUN-IN WITH THE

00:14:02.245 --> 00:14:03.345
SLASHER TOO.

00:14:03.345 --> 00:14:05.247
IT’S KINDA CRAZY, BUT I WAS

00:14:05.247 --> 00:14:07.115
SAVED BY ALL THESE PEOPLE.

00:14:07.115 --> 00:14:08.283
AND SOME OF THEM WERE JUST SO

00:14:08.283 --> 00:14:09.484
SUPER COOL.

00:14:09.484 --> 00:14:11.318
&gt;&gt; SO...SO SUPER COOL?

00:14:11.318 --> 00:14:12.586
WHAT’S GOIN’ ON?

00:14:12.586 --> 00:14:14.020
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS THIS BARTENDER

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.621
GUY WITH SUNGLASSES...

00:14:15.621 --> 00:14:16.722
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

00:14:16.722 --> 00:14:18.490
IS SHE TALKING ABOUT SHIZUO?

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:19.523
&gt;&gt; AND THERE WAS THIS OTHER

00:14:19.523 --> 00:14:22.158
REALLY AWESOME PERSON.

00:14:22.158 --> 00:14:23.126
YOU WON’T BELIEVE IT WHEN I

00:14:23.126 --> 00:14:24.394
TELL YOU...

00:14:24.394 --> 00:14:27.296
I MET THE HEADLESS RIDER!

00:14:27.296 --> 00:14:30.431
&gt;&gt; WH--SO...

00:14:30.431 --> 00:14:31.432
WAIT A SECOND!

00:14:31.432 --> 00:14:32.533
&gt;&gt; I GOT TO TALK TO IT FOR A FEW

00:14:32.533 --> 00:14:33.800
MINUTES.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.267
IT WAS SO AMAZING.

00:14:35.267 --> 00:14:36.402
YOU COULD TELL IT REALLY CARED

00:14:36.402 --> 00:14:37.536
ABOUT PEOPLE.

00:14:37.536 --> 00:14:38.637
IT IS ODD.

00:14:38.637 --> 00:14:39.637
YOU PROBABLY DON’T BELIEVE ME,

00:14:39.637 --> 00:14:40.738
DO YOU?

00:14:40.738 --> 00:14:42.439
&gt;&gt; NO, I MEAN, IF YOU’RE SAYING

00:14:42.439 --> 00:14:43.140
IT’S TRUE...

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.474
BUT CELTY’S A WOMAN!

00:14:44.474 --> 00:14:45.408
&gt;&gt; AND THEN WHEN I WAS ATTACKED

00:14:45.408 --> 00:14:47.276
A SECOND TIME, THE HEADLESS

00:14:47.276 --> 00:14:48.376
RIDER APPEARED OUT OF NOWHERE

00:14:48.376 --> 00:14:50.412
AND SAVED ME AGAIN.

00:14:50.412 --> 00:14:51.446
I GUESS THAT’S WHY I FEEL LIKE

00:14:51.446 --> 00:14:52.814
I’LL BE OKAY.

00:14:52.814 --> 00:14:53.780
&gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT THE HEADLESS RIDER

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:54.448
IS...

00:14:54.448 --> 00:14:55.749
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:14:55.749 --> 00:14:57.317
&gt;&gt; I CAN’T TELL HER, BECAUSE

00:14:57.317 --> 00:14:59.451
IF I DO...

00:14:59.451 --> 00:15:01.420
WELL, YOU SEE, IT’S JUST THAT

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.187
THOSE PEOPLE, THE WORLD THOSE

00:15:03.187 --> 00:15:04.388
GUYS LIVE IN IS JUST SO

00:15:04.388 --> 00:15:06.423
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM OURS...

00:15:06.423 --> 00:15:07.357
YOU MIGHT WANT TO KEEP YOUR

00:15:07.357 --> 00:15:08.590
DISTANCE FROM THEM.

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:10.326
&gt;&gt; TELL ME, MIKADO, WHAT DO

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:11.560
YOU THINK A TRULY UNUSUAL LIFE

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.727
WOULD BE LIKE?

00:15:12.727 --> 00:15:14.294
SOMETHING REALLY UNIQUE.

00:15:14.294 --> 00:15:14.736
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:15:14.736 --> 00:15:15.629
&gt;&gt; IT’D BE THE KIND OF LIFE

00:15:15.629 --> 00:15:17.297
WHERE, EVERY SINGLE DAY,

00:15:17.297 --> 00:15:19.365
NOTHING NEW EVER HAPPENED.

00:15:19.365 --> 00:15:20.833
NOTHING CHANGED.

00:15:20.833 --> 00:15:23.468
THAT KIND OF A LIFE IS TRULY

00:15:23.468 --> 00:15:29.405
UNUSUAL.

00:15:29.405 --> 00:15:30.506
&gt;&gt; I’LL HAVE A DOCTOR I KNOW

00:15:30.506 --> 00:15:31.340
TAKE A LOOK AT HER.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.508
DON’T WORRY.

00:15:34.508 --> 00:15:37.410
&gt;&gt; CELTY, I--LISTEN, I REALLY...

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:39.112
&gt;&gt; DON’T APOLOGIZE.

00:15:39.112 --> 00:15:40.279
YOU DID WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS

00:15:40.279 --> 00:15:41.480
BEST, DIDN’T YOU?

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.448
AND IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL

00:15:42.448 --> 00:15:43.749
BETTER, I THINK IT WAS RIGHT

00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:44.615
TOO.

00:15:44.615 --> 00:15:46.417
I DO THINK KNOCKING MY HEAD OFF

00:15:46.417 --> 00:15:48.185
TOOK THINGS A BIT TOO FAR, BUT

00:15:48.185 --> 00:15:51.554
I’LL TAKE THAT UP WITH SAIKA.

00:15:51.554 --> 00:15:52.721
I’M NOT ENDORSING EVERYTHING

00:15:52.721 --> 00:15:55.723
YOU DID.

00:15:55.723 --> 00:15:57.324
I JUST THINK IF WE WERE TO

00:15:57.324 --> 00:15:59.626
FIGHT, YOU’D WIN.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.164
IF YOU STILL HAVE YOUR DOUBTS,

00:16:06.164 --> 00:16:07.331
THEN I SUGGEST YOU STOP

00:16:07.331 --> 00:16:08.699
QUESTIONING YOURSELF AND

00:16:08.699 --> 00:16:10.433
INSTEAD USE THAT POWER YOU HAVE

00:16:10.433 --> 00:16:13.836
TO BETTER THIS TOWN.

00:16:13.836 --> 00:16:15.604
&gt;&gt; SHE HAD OBTAINED A POWER.

00:16:15.604 --> 00:16:17.105
A POWER THAT ALLOWED HER TO

00:16:17.105 --> 00:16:18.606
CONTROL A HUNDRED SAIKAS AND

00:16:18.606 --> 00:16:21.508
BEND THEM TO HER WILL.

00:16:21.508 --> 00:16:22.509
IT WAS NO SMALL BURDEN FOR

00:16:22.509 --> 00:16:23.609
HER TO BEAR.

00:16:23.609 --> 00:16:25.211
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT

00:16:25.211 --> 00:16:26.378
WAS A LOAD SHE WAS GLAD TO

00:16:26.378 --> 00:16:28.646
CARRY.

00:16:28.646 --> 00:16:30.181
SHE’D ALWAYS FELT SOMEWHAT

00:16:30.181 --> 00:16:31.448
ADRIFT BEFORE.

00:16:31.448 --> 00:16:32.649
BUT NOW, WITH THE FATE OF

00:16:32.649 --> 00:16:34.184
OTHERS WEIGHING IN HER HANDS,

00:16:34.184 --> 00:16:36.385
SHE FINALLY FELT GROUNDED IN

00:16:36.385 --> 00:16:37.586
REALITY.

00:16:37.586 --> 00:16:39.387
[buzzing sound]

00:16:39.387 --> 00:16:40.421
&gt;&gt; [gasps]

00:16:40.421 --> 00:16:41.722
&gt;&gt; JUST THEN, SHE HEARD A

00:16:41.722 --> 00:16:43.356
VOICE.

00:16:43.356 --> 00:16:44.757
IT SAID, "I MAY NOT LOVE YOU,

00:16:44.757 --> 00:16:46.525
BUT I DON’T HATE YOU."

00:16:46.525 --> 00:16:47.559
PERHAPS IT WAS JUST HER

00:16:47.559 --> 00:16:49.527
IMAGINATION.

00:16:49.527 --> 00:16:50.528
SO SHE CALLED OUT TO THE

00:16:50.528 --> 00:16:52.663
VOICE, BUT NO ONE ANSWERED.

00:16:52.663 --> 00:16:54.664
WHICH, IN THE END, WAS FINE BY

00:16:54.664 --> 00:16:56.165
HER.

00:16:56.165 --> 00:16:56.765
ACTUALLY, IT MADE HER A

00:16:56.765 --> 00:17:01.336
LITTLE HAPPY.

00:17:01.336 --> 00:17:06.306
&gt;&gt; [gasps]

00:17:06.306 --> 00:17:07.740
&gt;&gt; IT SEEMED THAT FINALLY HER

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:13.177
LIFE HAD GONE BACK TO NORMAL.

00:17:13.177 --> 00:17:14.578
HOWEVER, SHE COULDN’T TELL

00:17:14.578 --> 00:17:16.146
THEM THE TRUTH.

00:17:16.146 --> 00:17:17.447
NOT ABOUT SAIKA OR THE

00:17:17.447 --> 00:17:20.616
PERSON PULLING THE STRINGS.

00:17:20.616 --> 00:17:21.783
WHEN SHE TOOK CONTROL OF

00:17:21.783 --> 00:17:23.384
ALL THE SAIKAS, SHE ABSORBED

00:17:23.384 --> 00:17:24.685
THE MEMORIES HARUNA NIEKAWA

00:17:24.685 --> 00:17:26.686
HAD WITH THOSE BLADES.

00:17:26.686 --> 00:17:27.787
THAT’S HOW SHE DISCOVERED WHO

00:17:27.787 --> 00:17:30.423
WAS BEHIND THIS.

00:17:30.423 --> 00:17:31.557
SHE DIDN’T KNOW WHAT HE WAS

00:17:31.557 --> 00:17:32.590
AFTER.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:33.425
BUT IF THAT PERSON HURT

00:17:33.425 --> 00:17:35.559
MIKADO OR MASAOMI OR DISTURBED

00:17:35.559 --> 00:17:37.394
THEIR PEACE, SHE KNEW SHE’D

00:17:37.394 --> 00:17:39.362
HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

00:17:39.362 --> 00:17:40.596
RELIVING IT AGAIN WAS

00:17:40.596 --> 00:17:42.231
HORRIBLE, BUT SHE WAS

00:17:42.231 --> 00:17:43.298
DETERMINED TO REMEMBER HIS

00:17:43.298 --> 00:17:44.866
NAME.

00:17:44.866 --> 00:17:47.367
THEN IT CAME TO HER.

00:17:47.367 --> 00:17:49.536
&gt;&gt; IZAYA ORIHARA IS STRANGE.

00:17:49.536 --> 00:17:50.603
I CAN’T BELIEVE YOUR PARENTS

00:17:50.603 --> 00:17:51.804
NAMED YOU THAT.

00:17:51.804 --> 00:17:53.439
&gt;&gt; IT MAY BE A COINCIDENCE THAT

00:17:53.439 --> 00:17:54.439
I’VE TURNED OUT THE WAY THAT I

00:17:54.439 --> 00:17:55.473
HAVE.

00:17:55.473 --> 00:17:56.741
BUT THE NAME DOES FIT ME

00:17:56.741 --> 00:17:58.342
PERFECTLY.

00:17:58.342 --> 00:17:59.443
DO YOU BELIEVE IN COINCIDENCE,

00:17:59.443 --> 00:18:01.310
NAMIE?

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:03.178
&gt;&gt; WHY DO YOU ASK?

00:18:03.178 --> 00:18:04.512
&gt;&gt; I THINK MOST PEOPLE WILL

00:18:04.512 --> 00:18:05.513
ATTRIBUTE THESE RECENT EVENTS

00:18:05.513 --> 00:18:06.614
TO NOTHING MORE THAN

00:18:06.614 --> 00:18:08.249
COINCIDENCE.

00:18:08.249 --> 00:18:10.450
BUT YOU SEE, I SENT NASUJIMA TO

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:11.584
THE GIRL’S HOUSE AT THAT HOUR

00:18:11.584 --> 00:18:13.586
OF THE NIGHT.

00:18:13.586 --> 00:18:15.254
THAT POOR SUCKER WAS TRULY AN

00:18:15.254 --> 00:18:16.588
IDIOT.

00:18:16.588 --> 00:18:17.455
HE COULD HAVE FOUND

00:18:17.455 --> 00:18:19.190
ANRI SONOHARA’S ADDRESS JUST BY

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:21.358
PEEKING AT HIS CLASS ROSTER.

00:18:21.358 --> 00:18:23.459
YOU SEE, ONCE YOU ACCEPT THEY

00:18:23.459 --> 00:18:25.394
EXIST, THE HARD PART IS OVER.

00:18:25.394 --> 00:18:26.762
THEY’RE SUDDENLY EVERYWHERE.

00:18:26.762 --> 00:18:28.363
DEMONIC BLADES, FAERIES,

00:18:28.363 --> 00:18:29.264
THERE’S NO END.

00:18:29.264 --> 00:18:29.797
&gt;&gt; HMM?

00:18:29.797 --> 00:18:31.565
&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY, THE ONLY REAL

00:18:31.565 --> 00:18:33.466
COINCIDENCE, WAS WHEN

00:18:33.466 --> 00:18:36.434
NASUJIMA RAN OFF WITH MY CASH.

00:18:36.434 --> 00:18:37.635
HE OWED SOME SERIOUS DEBTS.

00:18:37.635 --> 00:18:39.203
SO HE TRIED TO GET THE CASH BY

00:18:39.203 --> 00:18:40.204
THREATENING THE PARENTS OF

00:18:40.204 --> 00:18:41.938
HARUNA NIEKAWA, THE GIRL WHO’D

00:18:41.938 --> 00:18:44.674
BEEN STALKING HIM AT SCHOOL.

00:18:44.674 --> 00:18:45.908
THE LOAN SHARKS HE OWED MONEY

00:18:45.908 --> 00:18:47.442
TO WERE THE AWAKUSU.

00:18:47.442 --> 00:18:48.677
SO THEY SENT HIM TO ME SO I

00:18:48.677 --> 00:18:49.844
COULD DIG UP A LITTLE DIRT ON

00:18:49.844 --> 00:18:51.212
THE GIRL’S FAMILY.

00:18:51.212 --> 00:18:52.846
OH! HI, THERE.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:18:59.718
HE TOOK THE BAIT, HOOK, LINE,

00:18:59.718 --> 00:19:01.586
AND SINKER.

00:19:01.586 --> 00:19:03.553
I KNEW HARUNA WAS SAIKA, OR AT

00:19:03.553 --> 00:19:05.589
LEAST A VARIATION.

00:19:05.589 --> 00:19:07.223
I HAD PLANNED TO CORNER HIM AND

00:19:07.223 --> 00:19:08.657
SAY SOMETHING LIKE, "HOW DARE

00:19:08.657 --> 00:19:09.992
YOU STEAL MY MONEY?"

00:19:09.992 --> 00:19:11.593
THEN I WAS GOING TO THREATEN HIM

00:19:11.593 --> 00:19:14.595
AND USE HARUNA, BUT THAT’S WHEN

00:19:14.595 --> 00:19:15.929
THE REAL SAIKA, THE ORIGINAL,

00:19:15.929 --> 00:19:18.498
CAME ONTO THE SCENE.

00:19:18.498 --> 00:19:20.332
SO THEN, WHAT BECAME OF

00:19:20.332 --> 00:19:20.865
NASUJIMA?

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:31.573
&gt;&gt; STOP! GIVE ME YOUR MONEY!

00:19:31.573 --> 00:19:33.508
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:19:33.508 --> 00:19:34.975
&gt;&gt; [howls]

00:19:34.975 --> 00:19:35.976
&gt;&gt; MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE

00:19:35.976 --> 00:19:37.544
WOULD’VE BEEN FOR SHIZU-CHAN TO

00:19:37.544 --> 00:19:39.345
HAVE DIED THAT NIGHT.

00:19:39.345 --> 00:19:41.514
BUT WHATEVER.

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:42.915
EVERYTHING STILL WORKED OUT THE

00:19:42.915 --> 00:19:44.816
WAY I WANTED THEM TO.

00:19:44.816 --> 00:19:46.417
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:19:46.417 --> 00:19:47.284
&gt;&gt; YOU WANNA ADD RESISTING

00:19:47.284 --> 00:19:48.018
ARREST?

00:19:48.018 --> 00:19:49.585
&gt;&gt; SO MANY COPS.

00:19:49.585 --> 00:19:52.988
WHAT’S UP WITH ALL THAT?

00:19:52.988 --> 00:19:54.022
&gt;&gt; THE MEDIA’S BLOWIN’ THIS

00:19:54.022 --> 00:19:55.256
THING UP HUGE.

00:19:55.256 --> 00:19:56.390
&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH, SOMETHING HAPPENED

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:58.358
IN SOUTH IKEBUKURO PARK TOO.

00:19:58.358 --> 00:19:59.259
&gt;&gt; I HEARD THAT WAS JUST SOME

00:19:59.259 --> 00:20:00.627
KIND OF TURF FIGHT.

00:20:00.627 --> 00:20:02.528
&gt;&gt; OH, SO IT WASN’T THE SLASHER.

00:20:02.528 --> 00:20:03.795
&gt;&gt; WHAT CAUSED ALL THAT, ANYWAY?

00:20:03.795 --> 00:20:05.296
THAT OLD GUY SEEMED TOTALLY OUT

00:20:05.296 --> 00:20:08.465
OF IT.

00:20:08.465 --> 00:20:09.533
&gt;&gt; IT’S ODD HE COULDN’T REMEMBER

00:20:09.533 --> 00:20:10.534
A THING.

00:20:10.534 --> 00:20:16.271
IT’S LIKE HE’D BEEN HYPNOTIZED.

00:20:16.271 --> 00:20:17.038
&gt;&gt; THE COPS STILL THINK IT WAS

00:20:17.038 --> 00:20:18.405
JUST ANOTHER FIGHT BETWEEN THE

00:20:18.405 --> 00:20:19.673
COLOR GANGS.

00:20:19.673 --> 00:20:23.576
&gt;&gt; IT’S NOT JUST THE COPS.

00:20:23.576 --> 00:20:25.577
[cell phone whispering]

00:20:25.577 --> 00:20:29.380
[all phones ringing]

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:30.548
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS...

00:20:30.548 --> 00:20:32.715
&gt;&gt; REALLY?

00:20:32.715 --> 00:20:34.750
&gt;&gt; SO THIS GUY, HE’S LIKE, THE

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:39.287
LEADER OF THE DOLLARS, ISN’T HE?

00:20:39.287 --> 00:20:44.890
&gt;&gt; CALM DOWN, MIKADO.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:47.292
&gt;&gt; SO, JUST WHAT WERE YOU AFTER

00:20:47.292 --> 00:20:48.426
ANYWAY?

00:20:48.426 --> 00:20:49.661
&gt;&gt; THIS CITY HAS BEEN BROKEN

00:20:49.661 --> 00:20:51.362
DOWN INTO THREE FACTIONS--THE

00:20:51.362 --> 00:20:52.729
DOLLARS, THE YELLOW SCARVES, AND

00:20:52.729 --> 00:20:54.897
THE ARMY OF THAT DEMONIC BLADE.

00:20:54.897 --> 00:20:56.298
AND THE FIRST TWO HAVE BEEN

00:20:56.298 --> 00:20:57.832
INFILTRATED BY SAIKA’S ARMY

00:20:57.832 --> 00:21:00.568
BRINGING SPIES TO BOTH CAMPS.

00:21:00.568 --> 00:21:02.370
TO BE HONEST, I’D HAVE BEEN

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:03.971
FINE WITH HARUNA NIEKAWA, JUST

00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:05.738
SO LONG AS THAT ARMY OF THE

00:21:05.738 --> 00:21:07.706
DAMNED CAME WITH HER.

00:21:07.706 --> 00:21:09.608
BUT THAT ANRI SONOHARA IS MORE

00:21:09.608 --> 00:21:10.675
INTERESTING.

00:21:10.675 --> 00:21:11.742
&gt;&gt; SO?

00:21:11.742 --> 00:21:12.877
&gt;&gt; I’M SIMPLY CREATING SPARKS

00:21:12.877 --> 00:21:14.311
RIGHT NOW.

00:21:14.311 --> 00:21:15.679
AND THAT’S FINE, ’CAUSE FROM

00:21:15.679 --> 00:21:16.713
HERE THINGS WILL BEGIN TO

00:21:16.713 --> 00:21:17.846
SMOLDER AND SMOKE ALL ON THEIR

00:21:17.846 --> 00:21:19.715
OWN.

00:21:19.715 --> 00:21:21.716
THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING ME!

00:21:21.716 --> 00:21:23.317
&gt;&gt; YES, BUT THE YELLOW SCARVES

00:21:23.317 --> 00:21:24.785
WERE STARTED BY A MIDDLE SCHOOL

00:21:24.785 --> 00:21:26.619
BRAT, WEREN’T THEY?

00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:28.688
HOW TOUGH CAN THEY REALLY BE?

00:21:28.688 --> 00:21:29.889
&gt;&gt; THE FACT THAT A KID LIKE HIM

00:21:29.889 --> 00:21:31.356
CAN PUT TOGETHER A POSSE OF

00:21:31.356 --> 00:21:32.957
THAT SIZE AND STRENGTH MEANS

00:21:32.957 --> 00:21:35.693
HE’S A SERIOUS THREAT.

00:21:35.693 --> 00:21:37.927
BUT THEN AGAIN THE HEAD OF THE

00:21:37.927 --> 00:21:40.396
YELLOW SCARVES IS SORT OF AN

00:21:40.396 --> 00:21:43.531
ACQUAINTANCE OF MINE.

00:21:43.531 --> 00:21:45.032
&gt;&gt; PLEASE, DON’T DRAG ME BACK

00:21:45.032 --> 00:21:46.833
INTO THIS.

00:21:46.833 --> 00:21:47.734
&gt;&gt; THOSE ASSHOLES ARE OUTTA

00:21:47.734 --> 00:21:48.702
CONTROL!

00:21:48.702 --> 00:21:50.069
COME ON, DUDE, WE CAN’T MAKE

00:21:50.069 --> 00:21:52.404
A MOVE WITH OUT YOUR CALL.

00:21:52.404 --> 00:21:53.738
&gt;&gt; YO, CALL HIM THE CHIEF.

00:21:53.738 --> 00:21:54.739
SHOW SOME DAMN RESPECT!

00:21:54.739 --> 00:21:56.440
&gt;&gt; YEAH, OKAY. I’M SORRY.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.441
&gt;&gt; IT’S FINE. LET IT RIDE.

00:21:58.441 --> 00:21:59.742
BESIDES, I’M NOT THE BOSS

00:21:59.742 --> 00:22:00.743
ANYMORE.

00:22:00.743 --> 00:22:02.677
I’M JUST A PLEBE NOW.

00:22:02.677 --> 00:22:05.113
ACTUALLY, I’M JUST YOUR--

00:22:05.113 --> 00:22:07.815
JUST YOUR AVERAGE HIGH-SCHOOLER.

00:22:07.815 --> 00:22:09.549
YEAH, BEING A HIGH-SCHOOLER IS

00:22:09.549 --> 00:22:10.983
ALL THAT I WANTED.

00:22:10.983 --> 00:22:12.551
MY LIFE FINALLY HAD A LITTLE

00:22:12.551 --> 00:22:13.652
PEACE TO IT.

00:22:13.652 --> 00:22:14.653
THE PEOPLE I’M TIGHT WITH WERE

00:22:14.653 --> 00:22:16.721
CLOSE TO ME, AND THINGS ONLY GOT

00:22:16.721 --> 00:22:18.655
EDGY WHEN I WANTED THEM TO.

00:22:18.655 --> 00:22:21.424
BUT THAT’S ALL GONE NOW.

00:22:21.424 --> 00:22:22.625
AND THE PEOPLE WHO WENT AFTER

00:22:22.625 --> 00:22:24.527
ANRI, THEY’RE GONNA HAVE TO

00:22:24.527 --> 00:22:26.428
PAY.

00:22:26.428 --> 00:22:27.729
I DON’T CARE HOW MANY SLASHERS

00:22:27.729 --> 00:22:29.063
ARE OUT THERE, BUT WE’RE GONNA

00:22:29.063 --> 00:22:30.397
CRUSH ’EM.

00:22:30.397 --> 00:22:31.697
AND IF IT TURNS OUT THE DOLLARS

00:22:31.697 --> 00:22:32.898
ARE MIXED UP IN ANY OF THIS,

00:22:32.898 --> 00:22:35.634
THEN WE’LL CRUSH THEM TOO.

00:22:35.634 --> 00:22:37.669
THOSE BASTARDS MANAGED TO DRAG

00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:39.403
ME BACK.

00:22:39.403 --> 00:22:40.838
DAMN IT.

00:22:40.838 --> 00:22:44.373
DAMN IT!
