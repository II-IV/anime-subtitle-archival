00:07:30.868 --> 00:07:33.602
DUDE--LONG LIVE POLYGAMY!

00:07:33.602 --> 00:07:34.936
&gt;&gt; POLYGA-WHAT?

00:07:34.936 --> 00:07:36.003
&gt;&gt; LATES, PEEPS.

00:07:36.003 --> 00:07:38.537
SEE YA TOMORROW!

00:07:38.537 --> 00:07:39.003
&gt;&gt; [sighs]

00:07:39.003 --> 00:07:41.204
I WONDER WHAT’S SO IMPORTANT.

00:07:41.204 --> 00:07:42.471
&gt;&gt; DON’T YOU THINK MASAOMI’S

00:07:42.471 --> 00:07:43.572
BEEN ACTING KIND OF WEIRD

00:07:43.572 --> 00:07:45.005
LATELY?

00:07:45.005 --> 00:07:46.239
&gt;&gt; HUH, REALLY?

00:07:46.239 --> 00:07:50.006
MAYBE YOU’RE OVERTHINKING IT.

00:07:50.006 --> 00:07:51.107
&gt;&gt; I NEVER ONCE MENTIONED THE

00:07:51.107 --> 00:07:53.908
YELLOW SCARVES TO MIKADO.

00:07:53.908 --> 00:07:55.142
MY LIFE WITH THESE GUYS AND MY

00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:56.608
LIFE WITH MIKADO ARE BOTH VERY

00:07:56.608 --> 00:07:58.543
REAL TO ME.

00:07:58.543 --> 00:07:59.809
BUT IN MY MIND, IT’S LIKE

00:07:59.809 --> 00:08:03.210
THEY’RE WORLDS APART.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:04.678
WE WOULD SPEND OUR WHOLE DAY

00:08:04.678 --> 00:08:06.111
FIGHTING.

00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:07.045
THAT WAS THE ONLY CONNECTION WE

00:08:07.045 --> 00:08:09.512
HAD WITH EACH OTHER.

00:08:09.512 --> 00:08:10.779
ALL I REALLY WANTED WAS FOR

00:08:10.779 --> 00:08:13.047
SOMEONE TO ACCEPT ME.

00:08:13.047 --> 00:08:14.513
AND THAT’S WHEN I FIRST MET

00:08:14.513 --> 00:08:16.948
SAKI.

00:08:16.948 --> 00:08:18.014
&gt;&gt; THAT YELLOW SCARF LOOKS GOOD

00:08:18.014 --> 00:08:19.782
ON YOU.

00:08:19.782 --> 00:08:20.582
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:08:20.582 --> 00:08:21.682
&gt;&gt; YOU’RE MUCH COOLER THAN THE

00:08:21.682 --> 00:08:22.950
RUMORS MAKE YOU OUT TO BE,

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:25.950
MASAOMI KIDA.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:27.017
&gt;&gt; WELL, NOW, HOW DID YOU KNOW

00:08:27.017 --> 00:08:28.817
WHAT MY NAME IS?

00:08:28.817 --> 00:08:30.085
WHAT ARE YA, SOME KIND OF

00:08:30.085 --> 00:08:31.552
CLAIRVOYANT?

00:08:31.552 --> 00:08:32.652
IF YOU CAN REALLY READ PEOPLES’

00:08:32.652 --> 00:08:33.919
MINDS, THEN I’M GONNA PUT YOU IN

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.253
A BAG AND TAKE YOU HOME WITH ME.

00:08:36.253 --> 00:08:37.520
&gt;&gt; [giggling] OH, MY GOD, YOU’RE

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.187
SO SILLY.

00:08:39.187 --> 00:08:40.487
SORRY, BUT IT WASN’T ME.

00:08:40.487 --> 00:08:44.088
SOMEBODY ELSE HAS E.S.P.

00:08:44.088 --> 00:08:45.656
&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH, WHO IS IT?

00:08:45.656 --> 00:08:46.922
ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS HAVE A SIXTH

00:08:46.922 --> 00:08:47.622
SENSE?

00:08:47.622 --> 00:08:48.890
&gt;&gt; NO, BUT THIS PERSON IS JUST

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:50.123
AMAZING.

00:08:50.123 --> 00:08:51.023
IT SEEMS LIKE HE KNOWS

00:08:51.023 --> 00:08:51.891
EVERYTHING.

00:08:51.891 --> 00:08:52.558
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:08:52.558 --> 00:08:53.824
THAT’S WHEN I FIRST MET THIS

00:08:53.824 --> 00:08:54.691
GUY.

00:08:54.691 --> 00:08:56.092
AND I SO WISH I HADN’T.

00:08:56.092 --> 00:08:57.192
&gt;&gt; WELL, HELLO THERE, HOW DO YOU

00:08:57.192 --> 00:08:58.192
DO?

00:08:58.192 --> 00:09:00.760
YOUR NAME IS MASAOMI KIDA, ISN’T

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.793
IT?

00:09:01.793 --> 00:09:03.527
&gt;&gt; THAT’S RIGHT. WHO ARE YOU?

00:09:03.527 --> 00:09:04.594
&gt;&gt; IZAYA ORIHARA.

00:09:04.594 --> 00:09:06.595
I’M AN INFORMATION BROKER.

00:09:06.595 --> 00:09:07.862
I’M SORT OF LIKE THIS GIRL’S

00:09:07.862 --> 00:09:09.128
GUARDIAN.

00:09:09.128 --> 00:09:10.029
[laughs]

00:09:10.029 --> 00:09:11.129
DON’T WORRY, I’M NOT HER

00:09:11.129 --> 00:09:13.063
BOYFRIEND OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

00:09:13.063 --> 00:09:14.697
IT’S A PLEASURE.

00:09:14.697 --> 00:09:17.665
[indistinct chatter]

00:09:20.866 --> 00:09:21.766
&gt;&gt; HEY, CHIEF.

00:09:21.766 --> 00:09:23.199
&gt;&gt; I SAID DON’T CALL ME THAT.

00:09:23.199 --> 00:09:24.633
I JUST WANT YOU TO USE MY NAME,

00:09:24.633 --> 00:09:25.967
MASAOMI, OKAY?

00:09:25.967 --> 00:09:27.033
&gt;&gt; Y-YEAH, SURE, BUT THAT SEEMS

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:29.201
KINDA WRONG.

00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:30.834
WE CAN’T FIND OUT SQUAT ON THE

00:09:30.834 --> 00:09:32.035
DOLLARS.

00:09:32.035 --> 00:09:33.669
SOME OF OUR GUYS USED TO BE

00:09:33.669 --> 00:09:34.936
MEMBERS, BUT EVEN THEY HAVE NO

00:09:34.936 --> 00:09:37.503
IDEA WHO THEIR LEADER IS.

00:09:37.503 --> 00:09:38.604
THEIR HEAD GUY DIDN’T EVEN

00:09:38.604 --> 00:09:39.704
REVEAL HIMSELF WHEN THEY MET SIX

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:42.172
MONTHS AGO.

00:09:42.172 --> 00:09:44.205
&gt;&gt; ARE THEY PLANNING ANYTHING?

00:09:44.205 --> 00:09:45.505
&gt;&gt; WELL, THE LEADER HAS SENT OUT

00:09:45.505 --> 00:09:46.573
A REQUEST ASKING FOR INFORMATION

00:09:46.573 --> 00:09:49.073
ON THE SLASHER.

00:09:49.073 --> 00:09:50.140
MAYBE THEY AREN’T BEHIND

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.674
THE SLASHER ATTACKS.

00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:52.740
&gt;&gt; EVEN IF YOU’RE RIGHT,

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.808
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS DOESN’T ADD

00:09:53.808 --> 00:09:55.075
UP.

00:09:55.075 --> 00:09:56.542
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:09:56.542 --> 00:09:57.509
&gt;&gt; ANYTHING ELSE?

00:09:57.509 --> 00:09:58.776
&gt;&gt; WELL, I KNOW HORADA GOT HIS

00:09:58.776 --> 00:10:00.210
ASS HANDED TO HIM BY THE BLACK

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:01.110
RIDER A WHILE BACK.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.510
&gt;&gt; HMM? HORADA?

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:04.778
&gt;&gt; UH, WELL, A WHILE BACK, I WAS

00:10:04.778 --> 00:10:06.044
BAGGING ON THIS FREAKY OLD GUY

00:10:06.044 --> 00:10:07.111
WEARING A GAS MASK AND THE BLACK

00:10:07.111 --> 00:10:10.679
RIDER JUST SHOWED UP.

00:10:10.679 --> 00:10:12.046
&gt;&gt; THE BLACK RIDER?

00:10:12.046 --> 00:10:13.113
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THERE WAS SOME KINDA

00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:14.180
CRAZY-LOOKIN’ BLACK OOZE SEEPING

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.614
OUT OF IT.

00:10:16.614 --> 00:10:17.847
SO, YOU KNOW...

00:10:17.847 --> 00:10:18.948
&gt;&gt; I WONDER WHO THIS BLACK RIDER

00:10:18.948 --> 00:10:20.882
PERSON REALLY IS.

00:10:20.882 --> 00:10:22.149
&gt;&gt; SOME SAY IT’S PART OF THE

00:10:22.149 --> 00:10:23.116
DOLLARS.

00:10:23.116 --> 00:10:24.883
&gt;&gt; YEAH, OKAY, WHATEVER.

00:10:24.883 --> 00:10:26.117
AND HEY, BY THE WAY, YOU GUYS

00:10:26.117 --> 00:10:27.584
ARE OLDER THAN ME, RIGHT?

00:10:27.584 --> 00:10:30.051
&gt;&gt; UH, YEAH.

00:10:30.051 --> 00:10:31.151
&gt;&gt; DON’T BE BRINGING IN GUYS WHO

00:10:31.151 --> 00:10:32.619
ARE ANY OLDER THAN YOU, THAT

00:10:32.619 --> 00:10:33.786
CLEAR?

00:10:33.786 --> 00:10:34.719
WE START SEEING NAMES LIKE

00:10:34.719 --> 00:10:35.786
SO-AND-SO OF THE WHATEVER YAKUZA

00:10:35.786 --> 00:10:39.220
AND THAT’S IT--WE’RE DONE FOR.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.521
&gt;&gt; W-WELL...

00:10:40.521 --> 00:10:41.621
&gt;&gt; WE’RE JUST A BUNCH OF PUNKS.

00:10:41.621 --> 00:10:44.055
THERE MAY BE A WHOLE LOT OF US,

00:10:44.055 --> 00:10:45.289
BUT IF WE START TANGLING WITH

00:10:45.289 --> 00:10:46.722
THE ADULTS, THEY’LL JUST USE US

00:10:46.722 --> 00:10:49.890
UP AND SPIT US OUT.

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:50.991
KIND OF LIKE...WHAT IZAYA

00:10:50.991 --> 00:10:53.957
ORIHARA DID TO ME.

00:10:53.957 --> 00:10:56.792
&gt;&gt; [grunts]

00:10:56.792 --> 00:10:58.226
&gt;&gt; YO, DUDE, CHILL!

00:10:58.226 --> 00:10:59.293
&gt;&gt; BACK THEN, WHENEVER I WASN’T

00:10:59.293 --> 00:11:01.827
SURE ABOUT SOMETHING,

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:03.060
SAKI WOULD TELL ME TO RUN IT BY

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.594
IZAYA.

00:11:04.594 --> 00:11:05.861
AND SO FROM TIME TO TIME, SHE’D

00:11:05.861 --> 00:11:08.028
GET HIS INPUT ON THINGS.

00:11:08.028 --> 00:11:08.962
&gt;&gt; SEE, IF YOU DO IT LIKE THIS--

00:11:08.962 --> 00:11:10.062
&gt;&gt; AT FIRST, EVERYONE WAS A

00:11:10.062 --> 00:11:11.162
LITTLE PISSED.

00:11:11.162 --> 00:11:12.263
BUT WHEN WE FOLLOWED HIS

00:11:12.263 --> 00:11:13.530
SUGGESTIONS, THINGS ACTUALLY

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.698
WORKED OUT OKAY.

00:11:16.698 --> 00:11:18.531
BUT I DIDN’T TRUST HIM.

00:11:18.531 --> 00:11:19.965
AND I NEVER GOT ANY CLOSER TO

00:11:19.965 --> 00:11:22.132
HIM THAN I NEEDED TO BE.

00:11:22.132 --> 00:11:24.233
&gt;&gt; IZAYA’S SO AMAZING.

00:11:24.233 --> 00:11:25.533
IT’S LIKE HE KNOWS EVERYTHING.

00:11:25.533 --> 00:11:28.134
HE’S NEVER WRONG.

00:11:28.134 --> 00:11:29.567
&gt;&gt; SO IF HE TOLD YOU TO JUMP OFF

00:11:29.567 --> 00:11:31.068
A CLIFF, WOULD YOU?

00:11:31.068 --> 00:11:33.002
&gt;&gt; PROBABLY, YEAH.

00:11:33.002 --> 00:11:35.703
&gt;&gt; I FELT SORRY FOR HER.

00:11:35.703 --> 00:11:36.969
I DIDN’T KNOW WHY IZAYA HAD SUCH

00:11:36.969 --> 00:11:38.570
A HOLD ON HER, BUT I WANTED TO

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.170
FREE HER FROM IT.

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.005
SO WHAT’S GOING ON WITH US?

00:11:42.005 --> 00:11:43.205
ARE WE DATING?

00:11:43.205 --> 00:11:45.006
&gt;&gt; YOU TELL ME. ARE WE?

00:11:45.006 --> 00:11:46.239
&gt;&gt; I DON’T GET IT. WHY ARE YOU

00:11:46.239 --> 00:11:47.872
HANGING OUT WITH A GUY LIKE ME

00:11:47.872 --> 00:11:48.707
ANYWAY?

00:11:48.707 --> 00:11:49.807
&gt;&gt; HMM...

00:11:49.807 --> 00:11:51.874
’CAUSE I LIKE YOU.

00:11:51.874 --> 00:11:53.141
&gt;&gt; DO YOU REALLY LIKE ME OR DID

00:11:53.141 --> 00:11:55.675
IZAYA TELL YOU TO LIKE ME?

00:11:55.675 --> 00:11:57.309
&gt;&gt; WELL, AT FIRST THAT WAS IT.

00:11:57.309 --> 00:11:58.910
&gt;&gt; [gasps]

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:00.010
&gt;&gt; BUT HE DOESN’T MESS WITH

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.110
OTHER PEOPLES’ LOVE LIVES.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:03.544
&gt;&gt; SO WHAT IS IT? WHY DO YOU

00:12:03.544 --> 00:12:04.644
STILL LIKE ME?

00:12:04.644 --> 00:12:06.545
&gt;&gt; ’CAUSE YOU’RE COOL.

00:12:06.545 --> 00:12:07.678
MM, OR MAYBE IT’S ’CAUSE YOU’RE

00:12:07.678 --> 00:12:09.078
CUTE.

00:12:09.078 --> 00:12:10.713
AND SO WHAT ABOUT YOU?

00:12:10.713 --> 00:12:12.179
DO YOU LIKE ME?

00:12:12.179 --> 00:12:13.079
&gt;&gt; MAYBE IF YOU WEREN’T SO

00:12:13.079 --> 00:12:14.147
FREAKISHLY DEVOTED TO IZAYA,

00:12:14.147 --> 00:12:16.280
I MIGHT.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.115
&gt;&gt; AND THAT WON’T CHANGE.

00:12:18.115 --> 00:12:19.548
SO PERHAPS YOU CAN FIND A WAY TO

00:12:19.548 --> 00:12:21.849
OVERLOOK THAT ONE FLAW OF MINE.

00:12:21.849 --> 00:12:23.082
&gt;&gt; SO YOU DO KNOW IT’S A FLAW,

00:12:23.082 --> 00:12:24.116
RIGHT?

00:12:24.116 --> 00:12:25.217
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I DO.

00:12:25.217 --> 00:12:26.983
BUT I’M NOT GONNA FIX IT.

00:12:26.983 --> 00:12:28.084
&gt;&gt; YOU SHOULD REALLY TRY AND FIX

00:12:28.084 --> 00:12:29.151
YOUR FAULTS.

00:12:29.151 --> 00:12:30.084
I’LL EVEN HELP YOU.

00:12:30.084 --> 00:12:32.252
&gt;&gt; [gasps]

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:33.119
&gt;&gt; AND AFTER THAT,

00:12:33.119 --> 00:12:35.586
WE STARTED TO DATE.

00:12:40.954 --> 00:12:42.588
NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE AN ISSUE

00:12:42.588 --> 00:12:44.288
WITH ME DATING SAKI.

00:12:44.288 --> 00:12:46.323
I WAS PRETTY SERIOUS ABOUT HER.

00:12:46.323 --> 00:12:47.623
AND THE YELLOW SCARVES WERE TOO

00:12:47.623 --> 00:12:48.723
BUSY FIGHTING THE BLUE SQUARES

00:12:48.723 --> 00:12:51.290
TO CARE ABOUT US.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:52.590
THE BLUE SQUARES NEVER FOUGHT

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:53.958
FAIR.

00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:54.925
THEY’D ONLY FIGHT GROUPS THEY

00:12:54.925 --> 00:12:55.991
OUTNUMBERED AND THEY WOULDN’T

00:12:55.991 --> 00:12:57.092
STRIKE UNLESS THEY KNEW THEY

00:12:57.092 --> 00:12:58.626
COULD WIN.

00:12:58.626 --> 00:12:59.959
OVER 100 OF MY FRIENDS WERE

00:12:59.959 --> 00:13:01.060
ATTACKED BY THEM.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.828
THEY WERE ALL SCARED--EVEN ME.

00:13:03.828 --> 00:13:05.061
I WAS AFRAID I’D HAVE TO END THE

00:13:05.061 --> 00:13:06.161
YELLOW SCARVES AND LOSE THE ONLY

00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:09.062
PLACE I FELT I BELONGED, SO...

00:13:09.062 --> 00:13:10.162
&gt;&gt; YOU SHOULD JUST ASK IZAYA

00:13:10.162 --> 00:13:12.263
WHAT TO DO.

00:13:12.263 --> 00:13:14.263
&gt;&gt; I ENDED UP RELYING ON HIM.

00:13:14.263 --> 00:13:15.864
I WAS SCARED.

00:13:15.864 --> 00:13:17.731
I DIDN’T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO.

00:13:17.731 --> 00:13:18.798
&gt;&gt; WELL, HELLO THERE, COME ON

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:19.265

00:13:20.732 --> 00:13:21.999
THIS FOR EVERYONE.

00:13:21.999 --> 00:13:23.266
&gt;&gt; WHY DON’T WE SIT DOWN AND

00:13:23.266 --> 00:13:24.299
HAVE A LITTLE CHAT?

00:13:24.299 --> 00:13:25.567
&gt;&gt; HIS INFORMATION CHANGED THE

00:13:25.567 --> 00:13:27.900
YELLOW SCARVES DRAMATICALLY.

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.135
HE DIDN’T JUST GIVE US TIPS ON

00:13:29.135 --> 00:13:30.835
WHERE TO FIND THE BLUE SQUARES.

00:13:30.835 --> 00:13:31.901
HE TOLD US EXACTLY HOW TO FIGHT

00:13:31.901 --> 00:13:33.336
THEM.

00:13:33.336 --> 00:13:34.636
WE STOPPED LOSING THOSE FIGHTS

00:13:34.636 --> 00:13:35.736
AND STARTED GAINING

00:13:35.736 --> 00:13:36.903
THE UPPER HAND.

00:13:36.903 --> 00:13:37.970
YOUR INFORMATION IS

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:38.870
UN-FREAKIN’-BELIEVABLE.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:39.938
AFTER A WHILE MY SUSPICIONS OF

00:13:39.938 --> 00:13:41.971
HIM STARTED TO FADE.

00:13:41.971 --> 00:13:43.905
I’D GOTTEN ALL CONFIDENT.

00:13:43.905 --> 00:13:45.872
I LOVED THAT WE WERE WINNING.

00:13:45.872 --> 00:13:46.939
BEATING THEM.

00:13:46.939 --> 00:13:47.806
BUT...

00:13:47.806 --> 00:13:48.573
[phone beeps]

THE NEAR FUTURE.

00:14:39.054 --> 00:14:40.954
FINAL QUESTION:

00:14:40.954 --> 00:14:42.755
IF YOU FAIL TO MEET US AT THE

00:14:51.924 --> 00:14:53.324
I HAD SCREWED UP.

00:14:53.324 --> 00:14:55.124
AND IN A MAJOR WAY.

00:14:55.124 --> 00:14:56.592
ALL ALONG I THOUGHT THIS WAS

00:14:56.592 --> 00:14:57.859
NOTHING MORE THAN A BUNCH OF

00:14:57.859 --> 00:14:58.992
JUNIOR HIGH KIDS GOING AT EACH

00:14:58.992 --> 00:15:01.726
OTHER.

00:15:01.726 --> 00:15:03.194
BUT IT WASN’T.

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:05.661
IT WAS WAR.

00:15:05.661 --> 00:15:06.762
AND THE PERSON WHO’D STARTED THE

00:15:06.762 --> 00:15:10.096
WHOLE THING WAS ME.

00:15:10.096 --> 00:15:11.296

&gt;&gt; AW, WHAT’S THE FUN IN THAT?

00:15:29.968 --> 00:15:31.769
WE ONLY BROKE HER LEG IN A FEW

00:15:31.769 --> 00:15:34.602
PLACES.

00:15:34.602 --> 00:15:36.003
&gt;&gt; I RAN TO HER AS FAST AS I

00:15:36.003 --> 00:15:37.036
COULD.

00:15:37.036 --> 00:15:38.270
MY PLAN WAS TO GO THERE AND KILL

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:39.737
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM WHO

00:15:39.737 --> 00:15:42.104

00:15:42.104 --> 00:15:46.206

ALL OF US ARE GETTING TOGETHER

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.007
TO PUT A BEAT DOWN ON THEIR

00:15:52.007 --> 00:15:53.040

00:15:53.908 --> 00:15:54.741

EVERYTHING I’D FELT ON THE WAY

00:16:28.784 --> 00:16:30.618
THERE WAS GONE.

00:16:30.618 --> 00:16:31.618
WHY?

00:16:31.618 --> 00:16:33.919
SAKI WAS IN DANGER, AND I

00:16:33.919 --> 00:16:34.986
COULDN’T MOVE.

00:16:34.986 --> 00:16:36.186
WHAT IS THIS?

00:16:36.186 --> 00:16:38.653
WHAT AM I SO SCARED OF?

00:16:38.653 --> 00:16:39.920
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT I COULD DO

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:43.054
ANYTHING FOR SAKI!

00:16:43.054 --> 00:16:44.655
I WAS POWERLESS.

00:16:50.791 --> 00:16:51.857
&gt;&gt; NAH, SHE’S NOT BLEEDING, SHE

00:16:51.857 --> 00:16:53.691
AIN’T GONNA DIE.

00:16:53.691 --> 00:16:54.692
&gt;&gt; HEY, GUYS.

00:16:54.692 --> 00:16:55.158

FATE LAY BEFORE HER.

00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:10.096

00:17:10.096 --> 00:17:10.996
&gt;&gt; EH?

00:17:10.996 --> 00:17:12.262

THIS POOR DAMSEL IN DISTRESS,

00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:15.930
THEN MAYBE THE REAL WORLD WOULD

GO ALL 2D AND TURN INTO AN ANIME

00:17:17.164 --> 00:17:18.631

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.143
TO MOVE HER TOO MUCH.

00:18:01.143 --> 00:18:02.776
SHE NEEDS TO GO TO A HOSPITAL

00:18:02.776 --> 00:18:03.711
IMMEDIATELY.

00:18:03.711 --> 00:18:04.977

BLUE SQUARES.

00:18:10.646 --> 00:18:11.713

00:18:42.421 --> 00:18:43.722
THE BLUE SQUARES GOT WEAKER AND

00:18:43.722 --> 00:18:48.989
FELL APART.

00:18:48.989 --> 00:18:51.090

00:19:00.126 --> 00:19:02.127
&gt;&gt; OH, RIGHT, I HEARD ABOUT YOU.

00:19:02.127 --> 00:19:03.193
YOU GUYS DECIDED TO GO AGAINST

00:19:03.193 --> 00:19:04.261
YOUR GANG AND STEPPED UP TO

00:19:04.261 --> 00:19:05.428

00:19:05.428 --> 00:19:08.095
SO, UH...I OWE YOU A BIG THANKS.

00:19:08.095 --> 00:19:09.162

00:19:09.162 --> 00:19:10.429
ACTUALLY WE WERE UP THERE JUST

00:19:10.429 --> 00:19:11.796
NOW, TALKING TO HER.

00:19:11.796 --> 00:19:13.096
SHE SAID THAT YOU HADN’T BEEN

00:19:13.096 --> 00:19:14.430

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:15.697
&gt;&gt; YEAH, WELL, THAT’S MY

00:19:15.697 --> 00:19:17.197

00:19:17.197 --> 00:19:19.298
&gt;&gt; I HAVE A MESSAGE TO GIVE YOU.

00:19:19.298 --> 00:19:20.765
SHE CAN SEE YOU PRETTY WELL FROM

00:19:20.765 --> 00:19:23.966
THE WINDOW IN HER ROOM.

00:19:23.966 --> 00:19:25.033
SHE SAID TO TELL YOU THANKS FOR

00:19:25.033 --> 00:19:26.734
COMING THIS FAR.

00:19:29.435 --> 00:19:30.435
I TOLD HER THAT YOU DID YOUR

00:19:30.435 --> 00:19:32.168
BEST TO SAVE HER, BUT THE BLUE

00:19:32.168 --> 00:19:33.269

00:19:33.269 --> 00:19:34.669
WEREN’T ABLE TO GET TO HER IN

00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:37.370

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:38.670
LOOK, IT DOESN’T SEEM LIKE SHE’S

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:40.904
MAD AT YOU, OKAY?

00:19:40.904 --> 00:19:42.438
SEE YA AROUND.

00:19:42.438 --> 00:19:43.704
&gt;&gt; WHY?

00:19:43.704 --> 00:19:46.005
WHAT DID YOU TELL HER THAT FOR?

00:19:46.005 --> 00:19:48.740
I DIDN’T ASK YOU TO DO THAT!

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:49.806
&gt;&gt; AND IF YOU HAD TOLD ME NOT

00:19:49.806 --> 00:19:51.074
TO, I WOULD’VE STILL TOLD HER

00:19:51.074 --> 00:19:52.441
ALL THAT ANYWAY.

00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:53.707
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY

00:19:53.707 --> 00:19:54.675
HAPPENED, RIGHT?

00:19:54.675 --> 00:19:56.775
I-I RAN AWAY.

00:19:56.775 --> 00:19:58.209
WHEN I GOT CLOSE TO HER, I JUST

00:19:58.209 --> 00:19:59.343
FROZE.

00:19:59.343 --> 00:20:00.976
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I KNOW THAT.

00:20:00.976 --> 00:20:02.410
AND IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE YOU’RE

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:03.277
STILL RUNNING FROM HER NOW,

00:20:03.277 --> 00:20:03.944
AREN’T YA?

00:20:03.944 --> 00:20:05.010
&gt;&gt; SO WHAT?

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.311
WHAT ELSE AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,

00:20:06.311 --> 00:20:07.711
LIE TO HER?

00:20:07.711 --> 00:20:08.445
I RAN AWAY.

00:20:08.445 --> 00:20:11.712
I JUST LEFT HER THERE!

00:20:11.712 --> 00:20:13.980
&gt;&gt; YO, KEEP IT TOGETHER, KID.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.080
IF YOU FEEL GUILTY ABOUT RUNNING

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.714
AWAY, THEN LYING TO HER IS THE

00:20:16.714 --> 00:20:17.781
PAIN YOU’LL JUST HAVE TO

00:20:17.781 --> 00:20:20.015
LEARN TO LIVE WITH, GOT IT?

00:20:20.015 --> 00:20:21.449
THAT’S THE LEAST YOU CAN DO TO

00:20:21.449 --> 00:20:23.249
MAKE IT UP TO THIS GIRL.

00:20:23.249 --> 00:20:24.683
AND IF YOU DON’T WANNA LIE TO

00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:27.084
HER, THEN STOP RUNNING.

00:20:27.084 --> 00:20:28.351
IT’S TIME YOU FACE WHAT YOU’RE

00:20:28.351 --> 00:20:29.417
AFRAID OF AND TELL HER THE

00:20:29.417 --> 00:20:31.318
TRUTH.

00:20:31.318 --> 00:20:32.785
IF YOU WANNA RUN FROM YOUR PAST,

00:20:32.785 --> 00:20:34.753
FINE.

00:20:34.753 --> 00:20:36.453
BUT WHATEVER YOU DO,

00:20:36.453 --> 00:20:37.719
DON’T RUN FROM THE PRESENT OR,

00:20:37.719 --> 00:20:40.354

00:20:41.455 --> 00:20:43.188

&gt;&gt; TOTALLY!

00:20:44.321 --> 00:20:45.422
I THINK WE SHOULD START CALLING

00:20:45.422 --> 00:20:46.356

00:20:46.356 --> 00:20:49.123
&gt;&gt; I NEVER DID FACE HER.

00:20:49.123 --> 00:20:50.690
I TRIED.

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:52.958
I WENT THERE MANY TIMES.

00:20:52.958 --> 00:20:54.391
I WAS JUST GONNA TELL HER THAT

00:20:54.391 --> 00:20:56.459
WE SHOULD BREAK UP.

00:20:56.459 --> 00:20:58.425
BUT I COULDN’T DO IT.

00:20:58.425 --> 00:21:00.360
THEN I LEFT THE YELLOW SCARVES.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.693
&gt;&gt; YOU DECIDE WHICH HIGH SCHOOL

00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:03.361
YOU’RE GONNA GO TO YET?

00:21:03.361 --> 00:21:05.094
&gt;&gt; YEAH, RAIRA ACADEMY.

00:21:05.094 --> 00:21:06.227

00:21:07.695 --> 00:21:09.395

00:21:09.395 --> 00:21:11.263
I WAS LONELY.

00:21:11.263 --> 00:21:12.729

00:21:12.729 --> 00:21:14.297
MIKADO, I FELT BETTER.

00:21:14.297 --> 00:21:16.364
YOU SHOULD COME, TOO.

00:21:16.364 --> 00:21:17.798

00:21:17.798 --> 00:21:18.931
TIGHT AGAIN.

00:21:18.931 --> 00:21:20.831
I ALSO MET ANRI.

00:21:20.831 --> 00:21:21.932

00:21:21.932 --> 00:21:23.032
