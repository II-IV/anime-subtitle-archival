00:07:56.277 --> 00:07:58.245
&gt;&gt; ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO, SAIKA

00:07:58.245 --> 00:08:00.347
SEEMED TO HAVE DISAPPEARED, BUT

00:08:00.347 --> 00:08:01.714
FROM WHAT I’VE SEEN IN THAT CHAT

00:08:01.714 --> 00:08:03.749
ROOM, I’D SAY THAT BLADE IS

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:05.250
STILL VERY MUCH ALIVE, AND IN

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:06.852
LOVE.

00:08:06.852 --> 00:08:09.687
&gt;&gt; WAIT, SHINRA, I REMEMBER NOW.

00:08:09.687 --> 00:08:10.721
I KNEW I’D MET THAT GUY WITH THE

00:08:10.721 --> 00:08:12.022
KNIFE SOMEWHERE BEFORE.

00:08:12.022 --> 00:08:13.223
HE’S A REPORTER.

00:08:13.223 --> 00:08:14.924
HIS NAME IS...

00:08:14.924 --> 00:08:16.192
&gt;&gt; I’VE LEARNED THAT YOU CAN’T

00:08:16.192 --> 00:08:18.327
ALWAYS RELY ON HUMANS.

00:08:18.327 --> 00:08:19.995
IT JUST GOES TO SHOW, IF YOU

00:08:19.995 --> 00:08:21.229
WANT TO PROVE YOUR LOVE, THEN

00:08:21.229 --> 00:08:22.397
YOU SHOULD GO AND DO IT

00:08:22.397 --> 00:08:23.865
YOURSELF.

00:08:23.865 --> 00:08:25.199
&gt;&gt; [grunts]

00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:27.133
&gt;&gt; I MUST SAY, I THOUGHT FOR

00:08:27.133 --> 00:08:28.334
SURE MY FATHER WOULD DO A BETTER

00:08:28.334 --> 00:08:30.736
JOB THAN THE OTHERS DID, BUT

00:08:30.736 --> 00:08:32.471
CLEARLY I WAS WRONG.

00:08:32.471 --> 00:08:34.473
SO I’LL DO THE JOB MYSELF.

00:08:34.473 --> 00:08:36.408
I WILL TAKE CARE OF THINGS ON MY

00:08:36.408 --> 00:08:37.876
OWN...

00:08:37.876 --> 00:08:40.778
WITH YOU, MY NEMESIS.

00:08:40.778 --> 00:08:43.413
&gt;&gt; SO THAT MAN, HE WAS YOUR

00:08:43.413 --> 00:08:44.281
FATHER?

00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:45.314
&gt;&gt; [groans]

00:08:45.314 --> 00:08:47.316
UGH.

00:08:47.316 --> 00:08:49.985
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS SHUJI NIEKAWA.

00:08:49.985 --> 00:08:51.252
HE’S THE GUY WHO WAS ATTACKED

00:08:51.252 --> 00:08:52.287
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS HOUSE.

00:08:52.287 --> 00:08:55.289
&gt;&gt; HMM, WHY WOULD IT DO THAT?

00:08:55.289 --> 00:08:57.424
UH, WHAT THE--

00:08:57.424 --> 00:09:01.394
WHAT?

00:09:01.394 --> 00:09:03.295
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:09:03.295 --> 00:09:05.330
SO DO YOU FEEL ANYTHING?

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:06.764
DOES IT SEEM LIKE SOMETHING’S

00:09:06.764 --> 00:09:08.165
TRYING TO POSSESS YOU?

00:09:08.165 --> 00:09:09.766
&gt;&gt; NO, NOT AT ALL.

00:09:09.766 --> 00:09:11.334
THIS ISN’T SAIKA.

00:09:11.334 --> 00:09:13.769
HERE, SEE FOR YOURSELF.

00:09:18.207 --> 00:09:19.441
THERE’S NO WAY THAT A LEGENDARY

00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:20.975
BLADE WHOSE HISTORY GOES BACK

00:09:20.975 --> 00:09:22.343
FOR DECADES WOULD SAY, "MADE IN

00:09:22.343 --> 00:09:25.078
2009."

00:09:25.078 --> 00:09:26.113
[taps on phone]

00:09:26.113 --> 00:09:28.114
&gt;&gt; HOW CAN THAT BE?

00:09:28.114 --> 00:09:29.381
LISTEN, I KNOW WHAT I SAW,

00:09:29.381 --> 00:09:30.416
BELIEVE ME.

00:09:30.416 --> 00:09:31.450
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE YOU.

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:32.918
I PROMISE, I WOULD NEVER DOUBT

00:09:32.918 --> 00:09:34.285
YOU.

00:09:34.285 --> 00:09:36.487
MAYBE THIS NIEKAWA GUY STUMBLED

00:09:36.487 --> 00:09:38.522
UPON THE SAIKA LEGEND AND TRIED

00:09:38.522 --> 00:09:39.823
TO COPY IT.

00:09:39.823 --> 00:09:40.424
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:09:40.424 --> 00:09:41.825
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE BIGGER ISSUE IS,

00:09:41.825 --> 00:09:43.392
IF THIS ISN’T SAIKA--

00:09:43.392 --> 00:09:44.960
&gt;&gt; THEN SAIKA’S STILL OUT THERE

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.095
SOMEWHERE, WHICH MEANS CHANCES

00:09:47.095 --> 00:09:48.930
ARE, IT’S STILL POSSESSING

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.332
SOMEONE AND ATTACKING PEOPLE.

00:09:51.332 --> 00:09:52.967
&gt;&gt; HOW ABOUT THE CHAT ROOM?

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:56.136
HAS IT BEEN THERE LATELY?

00:09:59.271 --> 00:10:01.173
&gt;&gt; BUT I TOLD YOU, I DON’T CARE

00:10:01.173 --> 00:10:03.107
ABOUT NASUJIMA, I PROMISE.

00:10:03.107 --> 00:10:04.508
&gt;&gt; THAT’S QUITE ALL RIGHT.

00:10:04.508 --> 00:10:06.044
I DON’T CARE HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT

00:10:06.044 --> 00:10:06.844
HIM.

00:10:06.844 --> 00:10:08.045
THAT’S NOT WHY I’M HERE.

00:10:08.045 --> 00:10:09.346
I’M HERE BECAUSE I’M DOING WHAT

00:10:09.346 --> 00:10:11.214
I HAVE TO DO IN ORDER TO PROVE

00:10:11.214 --> 00:10:12.415
MY LOVE.

00:10:12.415 --> 00:10:13.482
&gt;&gt; [whimpers]

00:10:13.482 --> 00:10:15.384
&gt;&gt; I DON’T LOVE YOU, BUT WHAT I

00:10:15.384 --> 00:10:18.219
HAVE IN MY HAND, SHE WILL.

00:10:18.219 --> 00:10:20.455
IN FACT, I THINK SAIKA WILL LOVE

00:10:20.455 --> 00:10:24.258
YOU TO PIECES.

00:10:24.258 --> 00:10:25.425
&gt;&gt; [gasps]

00:10:25.425 --> 00:10:26.292
[overlapping voices]

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:27.226
&gt;&gt; HOW DARE THEY HURT MY SISTER.

00:10:27.226 --> 00:10:28.327
MY TIMING WAS--CANNOT DEFY

00:10:28.327 --> 00:10:29.362
MOTHER’S ORDERS--HOW DARE THEY--

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:31.329
&gt;&gt; I CAN’T BELIEVE IT.

00:10:31.329 --> 00:10:33.298
SAIKA’S SPREADING.

00:10:33.298 --> 00:10:34.799
&gt;&gt; IF WE LOOK AT THIS LOGICALLY,

00:10:34.799 --> 00:10:35.800
THERE’S ONLY ONE POSSIBLE

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.101
CONCLUSION...

00:10:37.101 --> 00:10:38.869
CELTY, IMAGINE THIS.

00:10:38.869 --> 00:10:40.370
WHEN TWO PEOPLE DECIDE THEY LOVE

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:41.471
EACH OTHER, WHAT DO THEY

00:10:41.471 --> 00:10:42.938
FREQUENTLY DO NEXT?

00:10:42.938 --> 00:10:44.339
&gt;&gt; DO NEXT?

00:10:44.339 --> 00:10:45.274
&gt;&gt; [sighs] I DON’T HAVE ANY

00:10:45.274 --> 00:10:46.041
IDEA.

00:10:46.041 --> 00:10:47.309
ISN’T BEING IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE

00:10:47.309 --> 00:10:48.109
ENOUGH?

00:10:48.109 --> 00:10:50.044
&gt;&gt; NOT FOR MOST HUMANS.

00:10:50.044 --> 00:10:51.312
ONCE THEY KNOW THEY’RE IN LOVE,

00:10:51.312 --> 00:10:52.813
THE NEXT THING THEY DO IS TAKE

00:10:52.813 --> 00:10:54.447
IT A STEP FURTHER.

00:10:54.447 --> 00:10:55.915
THEY PRODUCE A PRODUCT OF THEIR

00:10:55.915 --> 00:10:56.916
LOVE.

00:10:56.916 --> 00:10:57.984
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU SAYING--

00:10:57.984 --> 00:10:59.418
&gt;&gt; I AM.

00:10:59.418 --> 00:11:01.519
I THINK SAIKA IS GIVING BIRTH.

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:02.888
SOMEHOW, BY SLASHING PEOPLE,

00:11:02.888 --> 00:11:05.456
IT’S IMPREGNATING THEM.

00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:07.324
WAIT, BEFORE YOU GO, I THINK YOU

00:11:07.324 --> 00:11:08.392
SHOULD TAKE THIS CHAT LOG ALONG

00:11:08.392 --> 00:11:09.493
WITH YOU.

00:11:09.493 --> 00:11:11.094
YOU’RE TRYING TO FIND SHIZUO,

00:11:11.094 --> 00:11:12.995
RIGHT?

00:11:20.034 --> 00:11:25.371
&gt;&gt; WHAT UP, IZAYA, BUDDY?

00:11:25.371 --> 00:11:27.873
WHY DON’T YOU COME ON OUT AND

00:11:27.873 --> 00:11:28.540
PLAY?

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:29.374
HUH?

00:11:29.374 --> 00:11:30.542
&gt;&gt; TELL ME, TO WHAT DO I OWE

00:11:30.542 --> 00:11:33.477
THIS PLEASURE, SHIZU-CHAN?

00:11:33.477 --> 00:11:35.246
&gt;&gt; I’M OBVIOUSLY HERE TO KICK

00:11:35.246 --> 00:11:36.413
YOUR SMARMY LITTLE ASS.

00:11:36.413 --> 00:11:38.181
&gt;&gt; AND WHY DO I DESERVE TO HAVE

00:11:38.181 --> 00:11:39.182
MY ASS KICKED?

00:11:39.182 --> 00:11:40.983
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE I’M PISSED OFF.

00:11:40.983 --> 00:11:42.018
&gt;&gt; NOW, DON’T YOU THINK THAT

00:11:42.018 --> 00:11:43.319
YOU’RE JUST A LITTLE TOO OLD TO

00:11:43.319 --> 00:11:44.953
ACT THE PART OF THE PLAYGROUND

00:11:44.953 --> 00:11:46.955
BULLY, SHIZU-CHAN?

00:11:46.955 --> 00:11:48.956
&gt;&gt; SHUT THE HELL UP!

00:11:48.956 --> 00:11:51.125
SO HOW INVOLVED IN THIS ARE YOU?

00:11:51.125 --> 00:11:52.126
&gt;&gt; [laughing] I DON’T KNOW WHAT

00:11:52.126 --> 00:11:54.894
YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:11:54.894 --> 00:11:56.262
&gt;&gt; YOU’RE IN WITH THE SLASHER,

00:11:56.262 --> 00:11:57.463
BUT I WANT TO KNOW HOW DEEP.

00:11:57.463 --> 00:11:58.463
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

00:11:58.463 --> 00:12:00.432
THAT’S A HORRIBLE ACCUSATION.

00:12:00.432 --> 00:12:02.333
&gt;&gt; 99% OF THE TIME, WHENEVER

00:12:02.333 --> 00:12:04.035
RANDOM, VIOLENT CRAP HAPPENS, IT

00:12:04.035 --> 00:12:05.602
SEEMS YOU’RE SOMEHOW INVOLVED.

00:12:05.602 --> 00:12:07.037
&gt;&gt; AND YOU CAN’T HAVE A LITTLE

00:12:07.037 --> 00:12:09.505
FAITH IN THAT LAST 1%?

00:12:09.505 --> 00:12:12.107
&gt;&gt; GUESS THAT’S A NO.

00:12:12.107 --> 00:12:13.208
&gt;&gt; [grunts]

00:12:13.208 --> 00:12:16.077
&gt;&gt; BY THE WAY, I DID SOME

00:12:16.077 --> 00:12:18.279
RESEARCH ON YOU.

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:20.480
YOUR LIFE IS PRETTY PATHETIC.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.281
&gt;&gt; [whimpers]

00:12:21.281 --> 00:12:22.549
&gt;&gt; IT SEEMS AROUND JUNIOR HIGH,

00:12:22.549 --> 00:12:24.283
YOU BEGAN TO LATCH ON TO SOME

00:12:24.283 --> 00:12:26.485
GIRL BY THE NAME OF MIKA HARIMA,

00:12:26.485 --> 00:12:28.554
TRYING TO SEDUCE EVERY GUY YOU

00:12:28.554 --> 00:12:29.387
COULD.

00:12:29.387 --> 00:12:30.355
OH, YEAH, I ALSO--

00:12:30.355 --> 00:12:31.622
&gt;&gt; WHAT CAN I DO?

00:12:31.622 --> 00:12:33.023
HOW CAN I GET OUT OF HERE?

00:12:33.023 --> 00:12:34.024
&gt;&gt; ...A ROBBER BROKE INTO YOUR

00:12:34.024 --> 00:12:35.192
HOUSE, AND KILLED BOTH YOUR

00:12:35.192 --> 00:12:35.992
PARENTS.

00:12:35.992 --> 00:12:37.160
YOU WERE IN THE SAME ROOM, BUT--

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.427
&gt;&gt; SIMPLE.

00:12:38.427 --> 00:12:40.163
I SHOULD JUST ACT LIKE I ALWAYS

00:12:40.163 --> 00:12:42.064
DO--LIKE THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO

00:12:42.064 --> 00:12:43.065
WITH ME.

00:12:43.065 --> 00:12:44.099
&gt;&gt; WHY WERE YOU THE ONLY ONE WHO

00:12:44.099 --> 00:12:45.066
SURVIVED?

00:12:45.066 --> 00:12:46.033
[echoing and distant] WAIT, I

00:12:46.033 --> 00:12:47.935
KNOW--YOU SEDUCED THE

00:12:47.935 --> 00:12:49.136
PERPETRATOR, DIDN’T YOU?

00:12:49.136 --> 00:12:51.071
YOU WERE ALREADY A WHORE THEN.

00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:54.674
WAS THE THIEF INTO LITTLE GIRLS?

00:12:54.674 --> 00:12:57.342
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THAT’S RIGHT.

00:12:57.342 --> 00:12:58.510
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A

00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.944
DISGUSTING LEECH.

00:12:59.944 --> 00:13:01.479
WHAT AN EASY TIME YOU HAVE,

00:13:01.479 --> 00:13:03.914
SUCKING THE LIFE OUT OF OTHERS.

00:13:03.914 --> 00:13:05.182
&gt;&gt; IT’S NOT EASY.

00:13:05.182 --> 00:13:05.983
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:13:05.983 --> 00:13:07.016
COME AGAIN?

00:13:07.016 --> 00:13:08.450
&gt;&gt; IT’S NOT EASY LIVING LIKE

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:10.419
THIS, ALWAYS NEEDING SOMEONE

00:13:10.419 --> 00:13:11.220
ELSE.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.554
I THINK THAT YOU’RE RIGHT.

00:13:12.554 --> 00:13:13.989
LEECH IS A PRETTY GOOD WAY TO

00:13:13.989 --> 00:13:15.090
DESCRIBE IT.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.224
HOWEVER, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT

00:13:17.224 --> 00:13:19.526
I’VE PUT MYSELF THROUGH, JUST SO

00:13:19.526 --> 00:13:21.027
I CAN STAY LATCHED ON TO

00:13:21.027 --> 00:13:22.661
SOMEONE.

00:13:22.661 --> 00:13:25.398
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

00:13:25.398 --> 00:13:27.665
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

00:13:27.665 --> 00:13:29.133
DO YOU REALLY EXPECT ME TO

00:13:29.133 --> 00:13:30.134
BELIEVE...

00:13:30.134 --> 00:13:31.135
YOU HAD TO DO BAD THINGS FOR

00:13:31.135 --> 00:13:32.269
TAKASHI TO LIKE YOU?

00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:33.069
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:13:33.069 --> 00:13:34.070
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.571
NOT FOR MR. NASUJIMA.

00:13:35.571 --> 00:13:37.307
HE’S NOT WORTH THE EFFORT.

00:13:37.307 --> 00:13:39.208
&gt;&gt; OH.

00:13:39.208 --> 00:13:40.409
THAT’S HOW YOU FEEL.

00:13:40.409 --> 00:13:41.443
FINE.

00:13:41.443 --> 00:13:42.244
NOW DIE!

00:13:42.244 --> 00:13:43.244
[door bell]

00:13:43.244 --> 00:13:45.246
&gt;&gt; [whimpers]

00:13:45.246 --> 00:13:47.347
&gt;&gt; UH, IS THAT A FRIEND?

00:14:38.154 --> 00:14:39.321
&gt;&gt; LOOK, IF I KNEW THIS WAS ALL

00:14:39.321 --> 00:14:40.989
IT’D TAKE TO GET CELTY TO SHOW

GOTTA LOVE THE INTERNET.

00:16:47.754 --> 00:16:49.088

00:16:49.088 --> 00:16:50.422
ISN’T HERE.

00:16:50.422 --> 00:16:51.289
BUT WHY?

00:16:51.289 --> 00:16:53.258

00:18:16.555 --> 00:18:17.823
IF THINGS GET OUT OF CONTROL,

00:18:17.823 --> 00:18:19.725
I’LL TAKE CARE OF IT, OKAY?

00:18:19.725 --> 00:18:21.392
&gt;&gt; NO, CELTY, THAT LAUGH WAS

00:18:21.392 --> 00:18:22.393

00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:23.528
I’M KINDA GLAD ABOUT THIS.

00:18:23.528 --> 00:18:25.795

00:18:28.531 --> 00:18:29.465
POWER.

00:18:29.465 --> 00:18:30.499
I’VE ALWAYS BEEN AFRAID THAT

00:18:30.499 --> 00:18:32.735
BECAUSE OF THIS, NOBODY WOULD

00:18:32.735 --> 00:18:35.170
EVER WANT ME.

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:37.304
BUT I WAS WRONG.

00:18:37.304 --> 00:18:39.173
ALL RIGHT, THEN, HOW MANY WE

00:18:39.173 --> 00:18:40.240

LET’S JUST CALL IT A LOT.

00:18:42.208 --> 00:18:45.310
SO NOW, THIS SHOULD DO IT.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.346
YOU KNOW, I THINK I CAN FULLY

00:18:47.346 --> 00:18:50.214
EMBRACE WHO I AM NOW.

00:18:50.214 --> 00:18:52.883
FINALLY START LIKING MYSELF.

00:18:52.883 --> 00:18:54.652
I’VE HATED THIS POWER SO MUCH,

00:18:54.652 --> 00:18:55.718
I’VE WANTED NOTHING MORE THAN TO

00:18:55.718 --> 00:18:58.421
BE RID OF IT.

00:18:58.421 --> 00:19:01.657
NOW I CAN FINALLY GO ALL OUT.

00:19:01.657 --> 00:19:05.193
HEY, BY THE WAY, I JUST WANT TO

00:19:05.193 --> 00:19:07.227
MAKE ONE THING CLEAR.

00:19:07.227 --> 00:19:09.229
NONE OF YOU ARE MY TYPE.

00:19:09.229 --> 00:19:11.398
NEVER HAVE BEEN, AND NEVER WILL

00:19:11.398 --> 00:19:12.331
BE.

00:19:12.331 --> 00:19:15.668
I HATE YOU GUYS, ALMOST AS MUCH

00:19:15.668 --> 00:19:16.969

YOU SAID SAIKA DISAPPEARED FIVE

00:19:24.808 --> 00:19:26.943
YEARS AGO, RIGHT?

00:19:26.943 --> 00:19:28.578
WHY IS THAT?

00:19:28.578 --> 00:19:31.880
WHAT HAPPENED FIVE YEARS AGO?

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.715
&gt;&gt; WELL, I HIGHLY DOUBT IT CHOSE

00:19:33.715 --> 00:19:35.483
TO TAKE A VACATION.

00:19:35.483 --> 00:19:37.250
IT’S POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE VERY

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:39.352
STRONG CAME IN CONTACT WITH IT

00:19:39.352 --> 00:19:40.453
AND HAS SOMEHOW MANAGED TO

00:19:40.453 --> 00:19:41.454
SUPPRESS IT.

00:19:42.388 --> 00:19:43.755
&gt;&gt; WHO WOULD THAT BE?

00:19:43.755 --> 00:19:45.624
&gt;&gt; I’VE THOUGHT ABOUT YOU FOR SO

00:19:45.624 --> 00:19:46.492
LONG.

00:19:46.492 --> 00:19:48.359
I KNOW YOU LOVED ME AS MUCH AS I

00:19:48.359 --> 00:19:49.360
LOVED YOU.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.795
YOU SHOWED THAT IN THE WAY YOU

00:19:50.795 --> 00:19:52.629
TRIED TO EXTORT MONEY FROM ME,

00:19:52.629 --> 00:19:54.464
AND HOW YOU TRIED TO ABANDON ME,

00:19:54.464 --> 00:19:55.665
ONCE YOU GOT BORED.

00:19:55.665 --> 00:19:57.433
AND NO MATTER WHAT, I ACCEPTED

00:19:57.433 --> 00:19:59.301
YOU, I LOVED AND FORGAVE YOU.

00:19:59.301 --> 00:20:01.369
&gt;&gt; [whimpers]

00:20:01.369 --> 00:20:03.505
&gt;&gt; BUT STILL, THAT JUST WASN’T

00:20:03.505 --> 00:20:04.305
ENOUGH.

00:20:04.305 --> 00:20:05.940
NO, THAT WASN’T EVEN CLOSE TO

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.774
ENOUGH.

00:20:07.774 --> 00:20:10.376
ENTER SAIKA.

00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:11.877
SHE STARTED SPEAKING TO ME AND

00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:13.412
TELLING ME THINGS.

00:20:13.412 --> 00:20:14.446
&gt;&gt; [pants in fear]

00:20:14.446 --> 00:20:17.015
&gt;&gt; THINGS LIKE THIS.

00:20:17.015 --> 00:20:19.383
AND THAT’S HOW SHE SPEAKS, WITH

00:20:19.383 --> 00:20:21.452
ME GIVING HER MORE BLOOD.

00:20:21.452 --> 00:20:22.820

&gt;&gt; SO WILL YOU TAKE MY LOVE?

00:20:27.823 --> 00:20:29.425
I REALLY DO WANT TO GIVE IT TO

00:20:29.425 --> 00:20:31.760
YOU.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.560
&gt;&gt; [whimpers]

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.561

00:20:54.944 --> 00:20:56.412
I’M GUESSING THAT SOMEONE CAME

00:20:56.412 --> 00:20:57.780
IN AND SAVED YOU AGAIN.

00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.914

00:21:03.284 --> 00:21:04.918
I DON’T NEED ADVICE FROM SOMEONE

00:21:04.918 --> 00:21:06.419
SO WEAK, THAT THEY LEECH OFF OF

00:21:06.419 --> 00:21:07.420
OTHERS.

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.388
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE IT WRONG.

00:21:08.388 --> 00:21:09.422
I DIDN’T DO IT BECAUSE I WAS

00:21:09.422 --> 00:21:11.423
WEAK, I HAD OTHER OPTIONS.

00:21:11.423 --> 00:21:13.492
I CHOSE THIS LIFE FOR A REASON,

00:21:13.492 --> 00:21:14.926
NOT BECAUSE I HAD TO.

00:21:37.677 --> 00:21:39.011

00:21:39.011 --> 00:21:40.613
THE FIRST TIME SAIKA TOLD ME TO

00:21:40.613 --> 00:21:41.881

&gt;&gt; THIS CAN’T BE!

00:22:27.616 --> 00:22:28.717
&gt;&gt; YOU WERE ABLE TO MAKE

00:22:28.717 --> 00:22:30.451
CHILDREN BY SLASHING OTHERS WITH

00:22:30.451 --> 00:22:32.753

00:22:44.562 --> 00:22:47.564
&gt;&gt; I AM UNABLE TO LOVE, AND THIS

00:22:47.564 --> 00:22:48.932
IS THE REASON...

00:22:48.932 --> 00:22:50.634
THAT I MUST RELY ON SAIKA TO

00:22:50.634 --> 00:22:52.668
