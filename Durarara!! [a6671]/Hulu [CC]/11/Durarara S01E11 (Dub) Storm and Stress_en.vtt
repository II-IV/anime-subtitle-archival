I JUST WANT TO SEE IF IT’S TRUE.

00:08:42.229 --> 00:08:45.231
BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT IS.

00:08:45.231 --> 00:08:48.366

PRETTY CONVENTIONAL.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:03.911
BUT THAT’S JUST ANOTHER WAY OF

00:09:03.911 --> 00:09:05.812
SAYING WHAT I BELIEVE--

00:09:05.812 --> 00:09:07.113

WHEN I WAS A KID, MY TOWN SEEMED

00:13:11.021 --> 00:13:12.089
LIKE IT WAS FILLED WITH

00:13:12.089 --> 00:13:13.223

WHEN DID I START FEELING LIKE

00:13:16.158 --> 00:13:18.194
THIS?

00:13:18.194 --> 00:13:20.828
I WANTED TO CHANGE THINGS, BUT I

00:13:20.828 --> 00:13:23.130
HAD NO REASON TO LEAVE, OR EVEN

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:24.998
THE COURAGE TO DO IT.

00:13:24.998 --> 00:13:26.866
AND THEN ONE DAY...

00:13:26.866 --> 00:13:28.901
UNH...UNH!

00:13:28.901 --> 00:13:31.236

THEN, AND WE STARTED EMAILING.

00:14:01.525 --> 00:14:06.328
AH...

00:14:06.328 --> 00:14:10.564
I MADE SOME NEW FRIENDS TOO.

00:14:10.564 --> 00:14:13.466
AND THEN ONE DAY, I HAD AN IDEA.

00:14:13.466 --> 00:14:14.967
IT STARTED OUT MORE AS A JOKE

00:14:14.967 --> 00:14:15.968
THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

00:14:15.968 --> 00:14:17.169
[chuckles]

00:14:17.169 --> 00:14:18.170
&gt;&gt; A GANG?

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:19.137
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THAT’S WHAT I’M

00:14:19.137 --> 00:14:20.038
THINKING.

00:14:20.038 --> 00:14:21.105
I’VE HEARD THERE’S A WHOLE LOT

00:14:21.105 --> 00:14:22.906
OF ’EM IN TOKYO RIGHT NOW.

00:14:22.906 --> 00:14:23.874
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU SAYING YOU WANT TO

00:14:23.874 --> 00:14:25.408
MAKE AN ONLINE GANG?

00:14:25.408 --> 00:14:27.309
&gt;&gt; NO, THAT’S NOT WHAT I MEAN.

00:14:27.309 --> 00:14:28.477
I WANT PEOPLE TO THINK THIS ONE

00:14:28.477 --> 00:14:29.511
IS REAL.

00:14:29.511 --> 00:14:31.246
WE’LL JUST SAY THE GANG IS IN

00:14:31.246 --> 00:14:32.980
IKEBUKURO, AND WE’LL SPREAD THE

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.915
RUMOR ALL OVER THE INTERNET.

00:14:34.915 --> 00:14:37.016
NONE OF US EVER REVEALED THAT WE

00:14:37.016 --> 00:14:38.551
WERE PART OF THE DOLLARS.

00:14:38.551 --> 00:14:40.252
WE TOLD PEOPLE THAT WE’D HEARD

00:14:40.252 --> 00:14:41.954
THE RUMOR FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE,

00:14:41.954 --> 00:14:42.987
AND PRETTY SOON IT WAS

00:14:42.987 --> 00:14:45.122
EVERYWHERE.

00:14:45.122 --> 00:14:46.923
WE MADE A WEB SITE FOR THE GANG,

00:14:46.923 --> 00:14:48.191
ONE YOU CAN ONLY ACCESS WITH A

00:14:48.191 --> 00:14:49.892
PASSWORD.

00:14:49.892 --> 00:14:50.993
THEN WE RANDOMLY LEAKED THE

00:14:50.993 --> 00:14:54.529
PASSWORD IN EMAILS AND FORUMS.

00:14:54.529 --> 00:14:56.364
I EVEN CREATED A BUNCH OF POSTS

00:14:56.364 --> 00:14:57.498
ON OUR MESSAGE BOARD AS OTHER

00:14:57.498 --> 00:14:58.632
MEMBERS.

00:14:58.632 --> 00:15:00.433
OF COURSE, A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:15:00.433 --> 00:15:02.001
DIDN’T BELIEVE US.

00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:03.302
BUT AFTER A WHILE, PEOPLE

00:15:03.302 --> 00:15:05.036
STARTED TO STICK UP FOR US.

00:15:05.036 --> 00:15:07.338
EVERYONE WAS HAPPY.

00:15:07.338 --> 00:15:08.373
&gt;&gt; DUDE, EVERYONE’S BUYING IT.

00:15:08.373 --> 00:15:09.506
&gt;&gt; I KNOW. THEY’RE ALL IDIOTS.

00:15:09.506 --> 00:15:12.308
&gt;&gt; BUT I HAD A BAD FEELING.

00:15:20.081 --> 00:15:21.115
PEOPLE STARTED APPEARING IN THE

00:15:21.115 --> 00:15:22.416
REAL WORLD SAYING THEY WERE IN

00:15:22.416 --> 00:15:24.050
THE DOLLARS.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:27.419
THAT’S NOT ALL.

00:15:27.419 --> 00:15:28.687
OUR MEMBER COUNT WAS REALLY

00:15:28.687 --> 00:15:31.055
SKYROCKETING...

00:15:31.055 --> 00:15:32.256
EVEN THOUGH WE’D LONG STOPPED

00:15:32.256 --> 00:15:34.457
GIVING OUT THE PASSWORD.

00:15:34.457 --> 00:15:37.093
IT WAS LIKE SOMEONE ELSE WAS

00:15:37.093 --> 00:15:39.428
LEAKING IT FOR US.

00:15:39.428 --> 00:15:42.297
HEY, GUYS, ARE YOU THERE?

00:15:42.297 --> 00:15:43.931
HELLO?

00:15:43.931 --> 00:15:45.065
MAYBE THEY GOT SCARED, BUT THE

00:15:45.065 --> 00:15:46.700
GUYS WHO HELPED ME START THE

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.235
DOLLARS HAD VANISHED.

00:15:52.937 --> 00:15:54.338
EVEN THOUGH THEY LEFT, I KEPT

00:15:54.338 --> 00:15:55.506
WITH IT.

00:15:55.506 --> 00:15:57.608
TRUTH IS, I COULDN’T STOP.

00:15:57.608 --> 00:15:59.075
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE WALKED AWAY

00:15:59.075 --> 00:16:03.112
THEN, BUT I DIDN’T.

00:16:03.112 --> 00:16:05.013
NO, THAT ISN’T TRUE.

00:16:05.013 --> 00:16:06.014
I KNOW THERE’S BEEN SOME BAD

00:16:06.014 --> 00:16:07.515
PEOPLE, BUT MOST OF THE PEOPLE

00:16:07.515 --> 00:16:09.216
IN THE GROUP ARE GOOD.

00:16:09.216 --> 00:16:10.250
I KNOW IT.

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.018
WHY DON’T WE MAKE THE DOLLARS

00:16:12.018 --> 00:16:13.619
DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER GANGS?

00:16:13.619 --> 00:16:15.086
LET’S MAKE IT A GOOD ONE.

00:16:15.086 --> 00:16:16.154
LET’S ALWAYS DO WHAT’S RIGHT SO

00:16:16.154 --> 00:16:17.655
WE NEGATE ALL THE BAD

00:16:17.655 --> 00:16:18.989
IMPRESSIONS ALL THE OTHER GANGS

00:16:18.989 --> 00:16:20.057
HAVE LEFT BEHIND.

00:16:20.057 --> 00:16:24.160
UH...EHH...

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.561
LIKE PICKING UP GARBAGE OR

00:16:25.561 --> 00:16:27.062
ERASING GRAFFITI.

00:16:27.062 --> 00:16:32.033
YOU KNOW, STUFF LIKE THAT.

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:35.635
[sighs]

00:16:35.635 --> 00:16:37.002
&gt;&gt; THAT’S RIGHT, THE ENTIRE

00:16:37.002 --> 00:16:38.137
NEIGHBORHOOD IS COMPLETELY

00:16:38.137 --> 00:16:39.104
MYSTIFIED.

00:16:39.104 --> 00:16:40.405
SOMETIME DURING THE COURSE OF

00:16:40.405 --> 00:16:42.340
LAST NIGHT, THE LARGE AMOUNT OF

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.607
GRAFFITI THAT HAD STAINED THIS

00:16:43.607 --> 00:16:45.242
NEIGHBORHOOD’S WALL SUDDENLY

00:16:45.242 --> 00:16:47.377
DISAPPEARED BY THIS MORNING.

00:16:47.377 --> 00:16:48.644
IT’S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT ONE

00:16:48.644 --> 00:16:50.246
PERSON COULD HAVE REMOVED SO

00:16:50.246 --> 00:16:51.379
MUCH GRAFFITI.

00:16:51.379 --> 00:16:52.580
AT THIS JUNCTURE, NO ONE...

&gt;&gt; [nervous chuckle]

00:16:53.581 --> 00:16:55.049
NO, THIS CAN’T BE.

00:16:55.049 --> 00:16:57.417
MASAOMI INVITED ME TO TOKYO, AND

00:16:57.417 --> 00:16:58.451
I CAME.

00:16:58.451 --> 00:16:59.152
AND THEN...

00:16:59.152 --> 00:17:00.086
THE DOLLARS?

00:17:00.086 --> 00:17:01.086
&gt;&gt; I DON’T MUCH ABOUT ’EM.

00:17:01.086 --> 00:17:02.154
ALL’S I KNOW IS THERE’S A LOT OF

00:17:02.154 --> 00:17:03.155
’EM.

00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:04.256
I ALSO HEARD THEY’RE KIND OF

00:17:04.256 --> 00:17:05.256
CRAZY.

00:17:05.256 --> 00:17:07.091
I WOULD JUST STAY AWAY FROM THEM

00:17:07.091 --> 00:17:08.058
IF I WAS YOU.

00:17:08.058 --> 00:17:09.225
THEY’RE SORT OF LIKE A COLOR

00:17:09.225 --> 00:17:10.460
GANG, BUT NO ONE KNOWS WHAT

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.461
COLOR THEY ARE.

00:17:11.461 --> 00:17:12.428
&gt;&gt; I WOULDN’T TRY AND GET NEAR

00:17:12.428 --> 00:17:13.495
THEM JUST FOR KICKS.

00:17:13.495 --> 00:17:15.630
THE LESS YOU KNOW ABOUT THOSE

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:17.398
GUYS, THE BETTER.

00:17:17.398 --> 00:17:18.332
&gt;&gt; WOULDN’T YOU GUYS SAY THE

00:17:18.332 --> 00:17:19.366
DOLLARS ARE PRETTY HARDCORE

00:17:19.366 --> 00:17:20.367
RIGHT NOW?

00:17:20.367 --> 00:17:21.768
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE THE DOLLARS LIKE?

00:17:21.768 --> 00:17:23.035
FILL US IN.

00:17:23.035 --> 00:17:24.703
&gt;&gt; WELL, I GUESS I’D SAY

00:17:24.703 --> 00:17:27.038
TRANSPARENT, AS IN NO COLOR.

00:17:27.038 --> 00:17:28.406
&gt;&gt; [slurps]

00:17:28.406 --> 00:17:30.107
THE DOLLARS?

00:17:30.107 --> 00:17:31.008
YEAH, I KNOW ’EM.

00:17:31.008 --> 00:17:34.043
IN FACT, I’M ONE OF ’EM.

00:17:34.043 --> 00:17:35.311
&gt;&gt; ONCE I JOINED THE DOLLARS,

00:17:35.311 --> 00:17:36.679
I GOT A GIRLFRIEND.

00:17:36.679 --> 00:17:37.646
&gt;&gt; IT’S PRETTY COOL.

00:17:37.646 --> 00:17:38.680
POST SOMETHING RANDOM ON THEIR

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.614
SITE...

00:17:39.614 --> 00:17:41.182
&gt;&gt; AND NO MATTER WHAT, SOMEONE

00:17:41.182 --> 00:17:42.283
ALWAYS RESPONDS.

00:17:42.283 --> 00:17:43.317
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, AT THIS AGE,

00:17:43.317 --> 00:17:45.085
MEETING SOMEONE OUTSIDE OF WORK

00:17:45.085 --> 00:17:46.786
IS OTHERWISE IMPOSSIBLE.

00:17:46.786 --> 00:17:48.053
&gt;&gt; DID YOU HEAR?

00:17:48.053 --> 00:17:49.254
THIS DUDE WAS ABOUT TO GET

00:17:49.254 --> 00:17:50.389
SNATCHED BY THOSE HUMAN

00:17:50.389 --> 00:17:52.023
TRAFFICKER GUYS, AND THE DOLLARS

00:17:52.023 --> 00:17:53.357

00:17:55.225 --> 00:17:58.094
&gt;&gt; I DON’T KNOW, IT SEEMED COOL,

00:17:58.094 --> 00:17:59.061
SO WHY NOT?

00:17:59.061 --> 00:18:04.099
[jet engine roars]

00:18:04.099 --> 00:18:08.001
[cell phones ringing, chiming]

00:18:15.173 --> 00:18:16.641
&gt;&gt; [chuckles]

00:18:16.641 --> 00:18:18.609
THIS IS SO MUCH FUN.

00:18:18.609 --> 00:18:19.776
WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED?

00:18:19.776 --> 00:18:22.044
[laughs]

00:18:22.044 --> 00:18:27.415
GOOD TIMES, RIGHT?

00:18:27.415 --> 00:18:29.250

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.183
