00:07:24.935 --> 00:07:27.604
I’LL ALLOW IT.

00:07:27.604 --> 00:07:28.872
HOWEVER, IT IS ONLY ON ONE

00:07:28.872 --> 00:07:31.374
CONDITION.

00:07:31.374 --> 00:07:33.242
YOU HAVE TO CALL ME FATHER!

00:07:33.242 --> 00:07:36.279
&gt;&gt; SHUT UP!

00:07:36.279 --> 00:07:37.780
&gt;&gt; REGARDLESS, CELTY.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.248
YOU REALIZE WITHOUT YOUR HEAD,

00:07:39.248 --> 00:07:41.049
YOUR MEMORIES WILL NEVER RETURN.

00:07:41.049 --> 00:07:42.317
YOUR REMEMBRANCE OF YOUR LIFE

00:07:42.317 --> 00:07:43.385
AS A DULLAHAN IN YOUR NATIVE

00:07:43.385 --> 00:07:47.389
IRELAND WILL BE GONE FOREVER.

00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:48.856
&gt;&gt; WELL, THERE’S NOTHING I CAN

00:07:48.856 --> 00:07:51.893
DO ABOUT THAT.

00:07:51.893 --> 00:07:52.794
&gt;&gt; WE’RE GOING TO MAKE NEW

00:07:52.794 --> 00:07:53.628
MEMORIES.

00:07:53.628 --> 00:07:54.862
A WHOLE LOT OF THEM TO REPLACE

00:07:54.862 --> 00:07:58.399
THE ONES YOU’VE LOST.

00:07:58.399 --> 00:07:59.733
&gt;&gt; SHINRA...

00:07:59.733 --> 00:08:00.767
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU SAY WE START

00:08:00.767 --> 00:08:02.869
PLANNING THE WEDDING?

00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:03.704
I’M GOING TO NEED YOUR

00:08:03.704 --> 00:08:04.671
MEASUREMENTS FOR THE WEDDING

00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:05.271
DRESS.

00:08:05.271 --> 00:08:06.239
BUT FIRST YOU’RE GOING TO NEED

00:08:06.239 --> 00:08:08.775
TO REMOVE THOSE SHADOWY CLOTHES.

00:08:08.775 --> 00:08:09.642
[groans]

00:08:09.642 --> 00:08:10.643
&gt;&gt; THAT BOY’S ALWAYS BEEN A

00:08:10.643 --> 00:08:11.744
SICKO.

00:08:11.744 --> 00:08:12.912
HE ENJOYED THOSE DISSECTIONS A

00:08:12.912 --> 00:08:14.714
TAD TOO MUCH.

00:08:14.714 --> 00:08:15.981
&gt;&gt; HERE CLEARLY GETS THAT FROM

00:08:15.981 --> 00:08:16.649
YOU.

00:08:16.649 --> 00:08:21.120
&gt;&gt; I TOLD YOU TO CALL ME FATHER.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:21.787
[sighs]

00:08:21.787 --> 00:08:23.222
UNBELIEVABLE...

00:08:23.222 --> 00:08:24.656
I JUST MADE THIS RULE AND YOU

00:08:24.656 --> 00:08:26.225
HAVE ALREADY FORGOTTEN IT.

00:08:26.225 --> 00:08:27.692
IT WAS THAT KIND OF NEGLIGENT

00:08:27.692 --> 00:08:28.860
BEHAVIOR, CELTY, THAT ALLOWED ME

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.394
TO STEAL YOUR HEAD--

00:08:30.394 --> 00:08:31.095
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:08:31.095 --> 00:08:33.297
&gt;&gt; UH...

00:08:33.297 --> 00:08:34.732
OH, DANG IT, DANG IT, DANG IT,

00:08:34.732 --> 00:08:35.666
DANG IT!

00:08:35.666 --> 00:08:37.068
&gt;&gt; WAIT A SECOND.

00:08:37.068 --> 00:08:38.436
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

00:08:38.436 --> 00:08:39.737
&gt;&gt; WHAT SHOULD I DO?

00:08:39.737 --> 00:08:40.704
I JUST SPILLED THE BEANS ON THE

00:08:40.704 --> 00:08:42.205
BIGGEST SECRET OF ALL.

00:08:42.205 --> 00:08:43.140
IT’S OKAY.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.675
CELTY’S A DINGBAT.

00:08:44.675 --> 00:08:45.442
SHE’LL PROBABLY FORGET IT IN A

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:46.709
SECOND.

00:08:46.709 --> 00:08:47.410
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.112
&gt;&gt; RINGY, DINGY CELTY.

00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:50.680
SILLY, DINGY CELTY.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.248
&gt;&gt; THAT’S ENOUGH!

00:08:51.248 --> 00:08:51.914
SHUT IT ALREADY!

00:08:51.914 --> 00:08:52.982
&gt;&gt; IT’S QUITE EASY TO AVOID THE

00:08:52.982 --> 00:08:56.819
ATTACKS OF A DINGY, CLUMSY GIRL.

00:08:56.819 --> 00:08:58.054
&gt;&gt; I WILL NOT LET YOU TAUNT

00:08:58.054 --> 00:09:00.456
CELTY EVEN IF YOU ARE MY FATHER.

00:09:00.456 --> 00:09:02.391
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!

00:09:02.391 --> 00:09:03.425
I’LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING.

00:09:03.425 --> 00:09:04.893
I SUPPOSE THERE’S NO POINT IN

00:09:04.893 --> 00:09:06.728
HIDING IT NOW.

00:09:06.728 --> 00:09:07.996
YES, THE CULPRIT WHO STOLE YOUR

00:09:07.996 --> 00:09:09.264
HEAD AND GAVE IT TO THE

00:09:09.264 --> 00:09:10.431
PHARMACEUTICAL GIANT IS NONE

00:09:10.431 --> 00:09:12.433
OTHER THAN YOURS TRULY.

00:09:12.433 --> 00:09:14.034
&gt;&gt; WELL DON’T BRAG ABOUT IT.

00:09:14.034 --> 00:09:14.802
&gt;&gt; WHATEVER.

00:09:14.802 --> 00:09:16.437
NOW COME WITH ME.

00:09:16.437 --> 00:09:17.372
I HAVE SOMETHING I WANT TO SHOW

00:09:17.372 --> 00:09:17.872
YOU.

00:09:17.872 --> 00:09:19.740
HA!

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.242
&gt;&gt; both: HUH?

00:09:30.283 --> 00:09:33.452
&gt;&gt; DID HE JUST LEAVE?

00:09:33.452 --> 00:09:35.454
&gt;&gt; AH!

00:09:35.454 --> 00:09:36.722
OH, YOU’RE NOT GETTING AWAY YOU

00:09:36.722 --> 00:09:40.459
CREEPY OLD LECH!

00:09:40.459 --> 00:09:44.396
[motorcycle roars]

00:09:47.765 --> 00:09:50.802
&gt;&gt; SHE GONE?

00:09:50.802 --> 00:09:52.269
[laughs]

00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:53.738
MY PLAN TO JUST PUSH THE

00:09:53.738 --> 00:09:54.839
ELEVATOR BUTTON WORKED LIKE A

00:09:54.839 --> 00:09:55.873
CHARM.

00:09:55.873 --> 00:09:58.943
I’LL RETRIEVE MY LUGGAGE LATER.

00:09:58.943 --> 00:10:01.212
FAREWELL!

00:10:06.817 --> 00:10:07.818
&gt;&gt; DAMN IT.

00:10:07.818 --> 00:10:10.020
WHERE’D HE GO?

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:15.291
HUH?

00:10:15.291 --> 00:10:17.827
&gt;&gt; OH, HEY THERE, CELTY.

00:10:17.827 --> 00:10:19.328
&gt;&gt; EVERYTHING OKAY?

00:10:19.328 --> 00:10:20.863
YOU SEEM A BIT OUT OF IT.

00:10:20.863 --> 00:10:22.097
&gt;&gt; WELL, I WAS JUST SORT OF LOST

00:10:22.097 --> 00:10:24.799
IN THOUGHT.

00:10:24.799 --> 00:10:26.801
&gt;&gt; ABOUT WHAT?

00:10:26.801 --> 00:10:28.870
YOU LOOK KINDA DOWN.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:29.838
WHAT IS IT?

00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:31.873
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

00:10:31.873 --> 00:10:34.075
IT’S ABOUT THE SLASHER.

00:10:34.075 --> 00:10:35.143
PEOPLE ARE SPREADING THIS

00:10:35.143 --> 00:10:36.444
STRANGE RUMOR ALL OVER THE

00:10:36.444 --> 00:10:38.279
INTERNET RIGHT NOW.

00:10:38.279 --> 00:10:39.980
&gt;&gt; WHAT STRANGE RUMOR?

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.281
&gt;&gt; WELL, THEY’RE SAYING THAT THE

00:10:41.281 --> 00:10:42.783
DOLLARS ARE BEHIND THE SLASHER

00:10:42.783 --> 00:10:43.516
ATTACKS.

00:10:43.516 --> 00:10:45.819
&gt;&gt; THEY CAN’T BE.

00:10:45.819 --> 00:10:47.387
YOU DON’T BELIEVE THAT, DO YOU?

00:10:47.387 --> 00:10:50.022
&gt;&gt; NO, OF COURSE I DON’T.

00:10:50.022 --> 00:10:51.291
BUT IF THIS RUMOR SPREADS, I GOT

00:10:51.291 --> 00:10:52.859
THIS SINKING FEELING THAT

00:10:52.859 --> 00:10:53.960
SOMETHING BAD IS GOING TO

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.895
HAPPEN.

00:10:55.895 --> 00:10:56.996
ESPECIALLY NOW WHEN THINGS ARE

00:10:56.996 --> 00:10:58.297
STARTING TO GET TENSE BETWEEN

00:10:58.297 --> 00:10:59.798
THE DOLLARS AND THE YELLOW

00:10:59.798 --> 00:11:03.569
SCARVES.

00:11:03.569 --> 00:11:04.803
&gt;&gt; HE’S RIGHT.

00:11:04.803 --> 00:11:06.037
THE BALANCE IN THIS CITY IS AT A

00:11:06.037 --> 00:11:09.440
TIPPING POINT RIGHT NOW.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.541
MIKADO, I’LL LOOK INTO THE

00:11:10.541 --> 00:11:14.144
SLASHER INCIDENTS MYSELF, OKAY?

00:11:14.144 --> 00:11:15.446
&gt;&gt; REALLY, CELTY?

00:11:15.446 --> 00:11:17.848
&gt;&gt; NOW YOU SHOULD GET GOING.

00:11:17.848 --> 00:11:19.116
YOU ZONE OUT TOO LONG AROUND

00:11:19.116 --> 00:11:20.417
THIS PLACE, SOMEONE’S ONLY GONNA

00:11:20.417 --> 00:11:22.019
TO END UP MUGGING YOU.

00:11:22.019 --> 00:11:24.021
&gt;&gt; YEAH...

00:11:24.021 --> 00:11:25.122
GOOD POINT.

00:11:25.122 --> 00:11:28.892
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

00:11:30.594 --> 00:11:32.561
&gt;&gt; THE SLASHER?

00:11:32.561 --> 00:11:35.298
SORRY, NO CLUE.

00:11:35.298 --> 00:11:36.365
&gt;&gt; I SEE.

00:11:36.365 --> 00:11:37.833
&gt;&gt; LISTEN...

00:11:37.833 --> 00:11:38.534
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

00:11:38.534 --> 00:11:39.835
YOU SHOULDN’T BE BUSTIN’ YOUR

00:11:39.835 --> 00:11:41.837
ASS SO HARD FOR THE DOLLARS.

00:11:41.837 --> 00:11:42.905
&gt;&gt; WELL, I’M NOT DOING THIS JUST

00:11:42.905 --> 00:11:44.206
FOR THE DOLLARS.

00:11:44.206 --> 00:11:45.440
&gt;&gt; I’VE GOT A SCORE TO SETTLE

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.075
WITH WHOEVER’S BEHIND ALL THIS.

00:11:47.075 --> 00:11:50.011
[metallic whoosh]

00:11:50.011 --> 00:11:51.045
&gt;&gt; HM.

00:11:51.045 --> 00:11:53.180
IF I ACTUALLY HAD A HEAD, I’D BE

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.548
DEAD NOW.

00:11:54.548 --> 00:11:55.616
&gt;&gt; DUMBASS...

00:11:55.616 --> 00:11:56.483
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:11:56.483 --> 00:11:57.384
&gt;&gt; ANYONE WHO CALLS YOU A

00:11:57.384 --> 00:11:59.120
DUMBASS IS A BIGGER DUMBASS,

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.121
AND SINCE I KNOW I’M A DUMBASS,

00:12:00.121 --> 00:12:01.322
I’LL SAY IT!

00:12:01.322 --> 00:12:02.022
DUMBASS!

00:12:02.022 --> 00:12:03.957
&gt;&gt; WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL ME THIS?

00:12:03.957 --> 00:12:05.158
I’LL KILL ’EM.

00:12:05.158 --> 00:12:06.426
WHOEVER IT IS, I’LL KILL ’EM

00:12:06.426 --> 00:12:07.928
DEAD!

00:12:07.928 --> 00:12:09.029
I’LL KILL ’EM DEADER THAN DEAD!

00:12:09.029 --> 00:12:10.596
&gt;&gt; WAIT, CALM DOWN.

00:12:10.596 --> 00:12:12.265
I’M THE HEADLESS RIDER.

00:12:12.265 --> 00:12:13.966
NOTHING HAPPENED TO ME.

00:12:13.966 --> 00:12:15.034
&gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO!

00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:16.335
THAT’S NOT THE POINT.

00:12:16.335 --> 00:12:17.603
IF SOMEONE PULLS A KNIFE ON YOU,

00:12:17.603 --> 00:12:18.871
THEN YOU HAVE TO KILL THE

00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:20.906
BASTARD!

00:12:20.906 --> 00:12:22.607
KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL...

00:12:22.607 --> 00:12:23.542
&gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT YOUR JOB?

00:12:23.542 --> 00:12:24.476
YOU’RE JUST ON A BREAK RIGHT

00:12:24.476 --> 00:12:25.076
NOW.

00:12:25.076 --> 00:12:26.645
&gt;&gt; WHO THE HELL CARES?

00:12:26.645 --> 00:12:28.413
&gt;&gt; LISTEN, IT’S ALL RIGHT.

00:12:28.413 --> 00:12:29.648
I’M NOT GONNA LET YOU GET FIRED

00:12:29.648 --> 00:12:30.581
BECAUSE OF ME.

00:12:30.581 --> 00:12:31.615
BESIDES IF I’M GOING TO GO AFTER

00:12:31.615 --> 00:12:32.984
THE SLASHER, I NEED TO GET SOME

00:12:32.984 --> 00:12:34.652
INFORMATION FIRST.

00:12:34.652 --> 00:12:35.919
SO BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING RASH,

00:12:35.919 --> 00:12:41.224
LET ME GET ALL THAT IN ORDER.

00:12:41.224 --> 00:12:42.960
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, THEN.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.663
FINE, BUT DO IT QUICK, OKAY?

00:12:46.663 --> 00:12:50.433
KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL...

00:12:50.433 --> 00:12:51.901
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS A REASON I LEFT

00:12:51.901 --> 00:12:54.871
SHIZUO ALONE FOR A WHILE.

00:13:01.477 --> 00:13:03.111
&gt;&gt; WELL, NOW...

00:13:03.111 --> 00:13:04.513
I’M GLAD THAT YOU DECIDED TO

00:13:04.513 --> 00:13:06.114
COME AND SEE ME.

00:13:06.114 --> 00:13:07.348
SO TELL ME, DID YOU EVER FIND

00:13:07.348 --> 00:13:09.684
YOUR HEAD?

00:13:09.684 --> 00:13:12.320
&gt;&gt; THAT’S NOT WHY I’M HERE.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.554
I’LL MAKE THIS QUICK.

00:13:13.554 --> 00:13:14.455
I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE

00:13:14.455 --> 00:13:15.490
SLASHER.

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:16.491
&gt;&gt; I’LL ONLY CHARGE YOU THREE

00:13:16.491 --> 00:13:21.528
BILLS FOR THAT.

00:13:23.263 --> 00:13:24.564
I’M GUESSIN’ YOUR CLOTHES AND

00:13:24.564 --> 00:13:25.632
WALLET ARE MADE OF THAT SHADOWY

00:13:25.632 --> 00:13:27.233
STUFF TOO.

00:13:27.233 --> 00:13:28.468
SO IF THAT’S THE CASE, IF I WERE

00:13:28.468 --> 00:13:29.569
TO SHINE A REALLY BRIGHT

00:13:29.569 --> 00:13:31.037
SPOTLIGHT ON YOU, WOULD I BE

00:13:31.037 --> 00:13:32.371
ABLE TO SEE YOU NAKED?

00:13:32.371 --> 00:13:34.073
&gt;&gt; WANNA TRY IT?

00:13:34.073 --> 00:13:35.474
&gt;&gt; NO, NOT REALLY.

00:13:35.474 --> 00:13:37.042
SEE, UNLIKE A CERTAIN

00:13:37.042 --> 00:13:38.411
UNDERGROUND DOCTOR WE BOTH KNOW,

00:13:38.411 --> 00:13:40.345
I’M NO PERVERT.

00:13:40.345 --> 00:13:41.513
I CAN’T GET IT UP FOR A CHICK

00:13:41.513 --> 00:13:42.547
WITHOUT A HEAD OR EVEN A CHICK

00:13:42.547 --> 00:13:45.984
WITHOUT A BODY.

00:13:45.984 --> 00:13:47.619
&gt;&gt; SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT ME.

00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:49.086
BUT INSULT SHINRA AGAIN AND IT

00:13:49.086 --> 00:13:50.688
WON’T GO WELL.

00:13:50.688 --> 00:13:52.023
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

00:13:52.023 --> 00:13:56.027
SO YOU TWO ARE IN LOVE.

00:13:56.027 --> 00:13:57.294
YOU KNOW I WONDER...

00:13:57.294 --> 00:13:58.595
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF ANOTHER

00:13:58.595 --> 00:14:00.664
DULLAHAN WERE TO COME ALONG?

00:14:00.664 --> 00:14:02.098
SHINRA MIGHT FALL FOR HER IN A

00:14:02.098 --> 00:14:04.100
SECOND.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.335
&gt;&gt; I’D LIKE TO THINK THAT’S NOT

00:14:05.335 --> 00:14:06.569
POSSIBLE.

00:14:06.569 --> 00:14:07.603
HOWEVER, IF IT DID HAPPEN...

00:14:07.603 --> 00:14:09.072
&gt;&gt; YOU’D KILL SHINRA AND THEN

00:14:09.072 --> 00:14:09.672
YOURSELF?

00:14:09.672 --> 00:14:11.141
&gt;&gt; NO, I JUST WOULDN’T LET

00:14:11.141 --> 00:14:12.508
ANOTHER HEADLESS WOMAN GET CLOSE

00:14:12.508 --> 00:14:15.678
TO HIM.

00:14:15.678 --> 00:14:20.549
I MEAN, I REALLY DO LOVE HIM.

00:14:20.549 --> 00:14:22.651
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

00:14:22.651 --> 00:14:25.420
SURE DIDN’T SEE THAT COMING.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.588
YOU’RE BECOMING MORE AND

00:14:26.588 --> 00:14:28.089
MORE HUMAN EVERY DAY.

00:14:28.089 --> 00:14:29.523
JUST BE CAREFUL, THOUGH.

00:14:29.523 --> 00:14:30.759
I’D HATE FOR YOU TO REALIZE ALL

00:14:30.759 --> 00:14:32.326
THIS ATTENTION YOU’VE PUT TOWARD

00:14:32.326 --> 00:14:33.627
BECOMING MORE HUMAN HAS CREATED

00:14:33.627 --> 00:14:34.695
A MUCH BIGGER GAP BETWEEN YOUR

00:14:34.695 --> 00:14:38.065
HEAD AND YOUR NECK.

00:14:38.065 --> 00:14:39.299
&gt;&gt; I’LL WORRY ABOUT THAT ONCE I

00:14:39.299 --> 00:14:41.534
GET MY HEAD BACK.

00:14:41.534 --> 00:14:42.635
TO BE HONEST, I’VE BEEN THINKING

00:14:42.635 --> 00:14:46.639
I DON’T REALLY NEED IT ANYMORE.

00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:48.308
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH ABOUT THIS.

00:14:48.308 --> 00:14:49.276
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THE

00:14:49.276 --> 00:14:50.343
SLASHER.

00:14:50.343 --> 00:14:51.611
DON’T TAKE MY MONEY AND THEN

00:14:51.611 --> 00:14:54.013
TELL ME YOU DON’T KNOW ANYTHING.

00:14:54.013 --> 00:14:55.581
&gt;&gt; DON’T WORRY, IT’S ALL GOOD.

00:14:55.581 --> 00:14:56.715
I’VE GOT SOME INFO THAT NEITHER

00:14:56.715 --> 00:14:58.184
THE COPS, THE MEDIA OR EVEN THE

00:14:58.184 --> 00:14:59.618
NET KNOWS OF.

00:14:59.618 --> 00:15:01.119
ACTUALLY, I’VE BEEN WAITING TO

00:15:01.119 --> 00:15:02.421
SHARE IT WITH YOU.

00:15:02.421 --> 00:15:04.055
&gt;&gt; WHY ME?

00:15:04.055 --> 00:15:05.423
&gt;&gt; HM.

00:15:05.423 --> 00:15:06.591
BECAUSE THERE’S A PRETERNATURAL

00:15:06.591 --> 00:15:08.626
ELEMENT TO THE SLASHER.

00:15:08.626 --> 00:15:10.395
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF A

00:15:10.395 --> 00:15:11.796
SWORD CALLED SAIKA?

00:15:11.796 --> 00:15:13.063
&gt;&gt; SAIKA?

00:15:13.063 --> 00:15:14.298
&gt;&gt; I KNOW THAT IT SOUNDS A

00:15:14.298 --> 00:15:15.566
LITTLE ODD, BUT SAIKA IS A

00:15:15.566 --> 00:15:16.667
DEMONIC BLADE THAT USED TO

00:15:16.667 --> 00:15:18.736
EXIST HERE IN SHINJUKU.

00:15:18.736 --> 00:15:20.204
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU MEAN "DEMONIC

00:15:20.204 --> 00:15:21.105
BLADE?"

00:15:21.105 --> 00:15:22.406
LIKE THE MURAMASA?

00:15:22.406 --> 00:15:23.607
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:15:23.607 --> 00:15:24.674
IT’S A SWORD IMBUED WITH DARK

00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:28.344
MAGIC.

00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:30.179
&gt;&gt; HEY, WHAT’S GOING ON?

00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:31.447
&gt;&gt; IZAYA TOLD ME ABOUT THIS

00:15:31.447 --> 00:15:33.649
DEMONIC BLADE CALLED SAIKA.

00:15:33.649 --> 00:15:35.418
ACCORDING TO LEGEND IT HAS A

00:15:35.418 --> 00:15:36.785
MIND OF ITS OWN.

00:15:36.785 --> 00:15:38.253
AND USES ITS POWER TO POSSES

00:15:38.253 --> 00:15:40.589
HUMANS.

00:15:40.589 --> 00:15:41.657
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT EVERY

00:15:41.657 --> 00:15:43.091
VICTIM HAS MADE MENTION OF WAS

00:15:43.091 --> 00:15:44.792
THAT THE SLASHER’S EYES WERE

00:15:44.792 --> 00:15:46.461
RED.

00:15:46.461 --> 00:15:48.195
&gt;&gt; SO, DO YOU THINK THAT

00:15:48.195 --> 00:15:49.196
SAIKA DID THIS?

00:15:49.196 --> 00:15:51.198
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:15:51.198 --> 00:15:52.499
EVERY TIME THERE’S BEEN A

00:15:52.499 --> 00:15:53.668
SLASHER ATTACK, SOMEONE WITH THE

00:15:53.668 --> 00:15:55.102
USER NAME SAIKA SHOWS UP ON THE

00:15:55.102 --> 00:15:57.338
NET.

00:15:57.338 --> 00:15:59.140
&gt;&gt; HUM.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:15:59.806
&gt;&gt; WHAT BOTHERS ME THOUGH IS

00:15:59.806 --> 00:16:01.775
THAT WHEN I WAS ATTACKED, I

00:16:01.775 --> 00:16:03.076
DIDN’T SENSE IT APPROACHING AT

00:16:03.076 --> 00:16:04.077
ALL.

00:16:04.077 --> 00:16:05.378
IF SAIKA TRULY ISN’T HUMAN, THEN

00:16:05.378 --> 00:16:06.646
I SHOULD HAVE FELT A PRESENCE OR

00:16:06.646 --> 00:16:09.382
SOMETHING.

00:16:09.382 --> 00:16:10.650
&gt;&gt; YES, BUT SAIKA IS JUST TAKING

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:11.751
OVER THEIR MINDS, THEREFORE THE

00:16:11.751 --> 00:16:13.319
BEING THAT APPROACHED WAS MAINLY

00:16:13.319 --> 00:16:15.254
HUMAN.

00:16:15.254 --> 00:16:16.555
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY YOU

00:16:16.555 --> 00:16:17.723
DIDN’T SENSE A SUPERNATURAL

00:16:17.723 --> 00:16:19.558
PRESENCE AT THE TIME.

00:16:19.558 --> 00:16:20.792
&gt;&gt; SHINRA, YOU SEEM TO KNOW A

00:16:20.792 --> 00:16:23.595
LOT ABOUT SAIKA.

00:16:23.595 --> 00:16:24.629
&gt;&gt; I DO?

00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:25.664
WELL, YOU TOLD ME TO LOOK INTO

00:16:25.664 --> 00:16:26.765
IT, SO I DID.

00:16:26.765 --> 00:16:28.532
ALL RIGHT, HURRY UP AND COME TO

00:16:28.532 --> 00:16:33.437
BED.

00:16:33.437 --> 00:16:35.339
&gt;&gt; I COULDN’T HELP BUT THINK

00:16:35.339 --> 00:16:37.375
SHINRA WAS HIDING SOMETHING.

00:16:43.746 --> 00:16:44.481
[gun cocks]

00:16:44.481 --> 00:16:47.317
&gt;&gt; [gasps]

00:16:47.317 --> 00:16:49.519
&gt;&gt; HELLO, WELCOME BACK.

00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:50.687
WHEN MS. NAMNIA HERE DISAPPEARED

00:16:50.687 --> 00:16:53.389
AFTER THE MERGER WITH NEBRACORE

00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:54.656
I DECIDED TO DO A LITTLE

00:16:54.656 --> 00:16:56.325
INVESTIGATING.

00:16:56.325 --> 00:16:57.626
AND IN MY RESEARCH, I DISCOVERED

00:16:57.626 --> 00:16:58.494
THAT SHE VISITS YOU NOW ON A

00:16:58.494 --> 00:16:59.695
REGULAR BASIS.

00:16:59.695 --> 00:17:01.196
SO WITH A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT

00:17:01.196 --> 00:17:02.430
FROM MY TOY GUN, SHE WAS KIND

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.365
ENOUGH TO ESCORT ME IN.

00:17:04.365 --> 00:17:05.734
&gt;&gt; YOUR TOY GUN?

00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:07.802
&gt;&gt; OH, DID I NOT MENTION THAT?

00:17:07.802 --> 00:17:08.669
[gunshot]

00:17:08.669 --> 00:17:09.737
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO REPORT THIS BASTARD

00:17:09.737 --> 00:17:11.772
TO THE POLICE.

00:17:11.772 --> 00:17:12.707
&gt;&gt; REALLY?

00:17:12.707 --> 00:17:13.741
WOULDN’T YOU BE THE ONES IN HOT

00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:15.843
WATER IF THAT HAPPENS?

00:17:15.843 --> 00:17:17.144
MY TESTIMONY MAY LEAD THE POLICE

00:17:17.144 --> 00:17:18.445
TO SEARCH THIS ROOM, WHERE

00:17:18.445 --> 00:17:19.713
THEY’LL FIND THE BLOODY HEAD OF

00:17:19.713 --> 00:17:21.781
A POOR YOUNG WOMAN.

00:17:21.781 --> 00:17:23.250
WHO KNOWS, MAYBE THAT WILL BE

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:24.551
EVEN BIGGER NEWS THAN THE

00:17:24.551 --> 00:17:26.786
SLASHER CURRENTLY IS.

00:17:26.786 --> 00:17:27.854
&gt;&gt; SO...

00:17:27.854 --> 00:17:29.522
NOW I SEE WHERE SHINRA GETS HIS

00:17:29.522 --> 00:17:31.890
LOVELY TWISTED DISPOSITION.

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:32.791
&gt;&gt; FLATTERY WILL GET YOU

00:17:32.791 --> 00:17:34.193
NOWHERE.

00:17:34.193 --> 00:17:35.361
TO BE HONEST, I’M IN NO RUSH TO

00:17:35.361 --> 00:17:39.264
RECOVER THE HEAD JUST YET.

00:17:39.264 --> 00:17:40.565
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:17:40.565 --> 00:17:41.834
&gt;&gt; THE EXECUTIVES AT MY COMPANY

00:17:41.834 --> 00:17:42.935
WERE QUITE TAKEN ABACK BY

00:17:42.935 --> 00:17:46.804
CELTY’S LITTLE TELEVISION DEBUT.

00:17:46.804 --> 00:17:47.905
AND, NOW THEY’RE FAR MORE

00:17:47.905 --> 00:17:49.407
INTERESTED IN STUDDING THE BODY

00:17:49.407 --> 00:17:51.843
AT THIS POINT THAN THE HEAD.

00:17:51.843 --> 00:17:52.744
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

00:17:52.744 --> 00:17:53.744
&gt;&gt; SO THAT’S WHY I TOLD THE

00:17:53.744 --> 00:17:54.912
COMPANY THAT I WOULD INVESTIGATE

00:17:54.912 --> 00:17:57.214
THE HEAD ON MY OWN.

00:17:59.283 --> 00:18:00.617
AFTER ALL, I THINK THE APPROACH

00:18:00.617 --> 00:18:01.885
YOU HAVE TAKEN TO THIS UNIQUE

00:18:01.885 --> 00:18:05.355
MATTER IS VERY INTERESTING.

00:18:05.355 --> 00:18:06.456
IN YOUR THEORY, DULLAHANS ARE

00:18:06.456 --> 00:18:08.758
ACTUALLY A TYPE OF VALKYRIE.

00:18:08.758 --> 00:18:10.426
YOU’RE HOPING TO INVOLVE THE

00:18:10.426 --> 00:18:11.694
HEAD IN SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE OR

00:18:11.694 --> 00:18:13.395
CONFLICT...

00:18:13.395 --> 00:18:14.429
SO YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO ROUSE IT

00:18:14.429 --> 00:18:16.398
INTO CONSCIOUSNESS, HM?

00:18:16.398 --> 00:18:17.699
&gt;&gt; WELL, I’VE TRIED MANY

00:18:17.699 --> 00:18:19.234
APPROACHES.

00:18:19.234 --> 00:18:20.269
BUT IF ALL ELSE FAILS I MAY HAVE

00:18:20.269 --> 00:18:21.536
NO CHOICE BUT TO BRING THAT HEAD

00:18:21.536 --> 00:18:23.505
INTO A WARZONE.

00:18:23.505 --> 00:18:24.806
REGARDLESS THOUGH, I WOULD BE

00:18:24.806 --> 00:18:26.240
HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.275
IF THAT IS INDEED WHY YOU CAME

00:18:27.275 --> 00:18:29.243
HERE.

00:18:29.243 --> 00:18:30.344
&gt;&gt; EXCELLENT.

00:18:30.344 --> 00:18:31.579
I’VE HAD MY EYE ON YOU FOR QUITE

00:18:31.579 --> 00:18:33.281
SOME TIME.

00:18:33.281 --> 00:18:34.348
NOBODY ELSE THOUGHT TO LOOK AT

00:18:34.348 --> 00:18:35.716
THIS FROM A MYTHOLOGICAL

00:18:35.716 --> 00:18:38.418
STANDPOINT, NOT EVEN MYSELF.

00:18:38.418 --> 00:18:39.486
I’M VERY IMPRESSED.

00:18:39.486 --> 00:18:42.855
&gt;&gt; WHY, THANK YOU.

00:18:42.855 --> 00:18:44.224
&gt;&gt; BEFORE I GO, LET ME GIVE YOU

00:18:44.224 --> 00:18:45.858
ONE PIECE OF ADVICE.

00:18:45.858 --> 00:18:47.294
&gt;&gt; IF YOU DO CREATE SOME SORT OF

00:18:47.294 --> 00:18:48.361
CONFLICT HERE IN TOKYO IN AN

00:18:48.361 --> 00:18:50.930
EFFORT TO ROUSE CELTY’S HEAD, OR

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.464
HER SOUL, I WILL MAKE ONE

00:18:52.464 --> 00:18:53.833
SUGGESTION.

00:18:53.833 --> 00:18:55.334
INSTEAD OF PULLING CELTY INTO

00:18:55.334 --> 00:18:56.502
SOMEONE ELSE’S WAR, INSTEAD

00:18:56.502 --> 00:19:00.972
CREATE THE CONFLICT AROUND HER.

00:19:00.972 --> 00:19:02.674
AND WHOEVER SHOWS UP FOR THE

00:19:02.674 --> 00:19:06.945
FIGHT, THROW THEM INTO THE FIRE.

00:19:06.945 --> 00:19:10.348
&gt;&gt; THAT’S MY INTENTION.

00:19:10.348 --> 00:19:11.449
IN FACT, THINGS ARE PROGRESSING

00:19:11.449 --> 00:19:12.717
IN THAT DIRECTION FASTER THAN I

00:19:12.717 --> 00:19:15.285
THOUGHT.

00:19:16.821 --> 00:19:18.822
&gt;&gt; ANRI...

00:19:18.822 --> 00:19:20.257
&gt;&gt; I KNOW IT’S TIME FOR GYM

00:19:20.257 --> 00:19:23.293
CLASS NOW, BUT ARE YOU OKAY?

00:19:23.293 --> 00:19:23.793
&gt;&gt; I’M FINE.

00:19:23.793 --> 00:19:25.294
&gt;&gt; I’VE BEEN WORRIED.

00:19:25.294 --> 00:19:26.362
WHAT WERE YOU DOING WITH THOSE

00:19:26.362 --> 00:19:27.731
STUDENTS WHO WERE ATTACKED THE

00:19:27.731 --> 00:19:28.631
OTHER DAY?

00:19:28.631 --> 00:19:29.899
DON’T TELL ME THOSE GIRLS HAVE

00:19:29.899 --> 00:19:31.834
BEEN BULLYING YOU AGAIN.

00:19:31.834 --> 00:19:33.402
I’M WORRIED, ANRI, REALLY

00:19:33.402 --> 00:19:35.003
WORRIED.

00:19:35.003 --> 00:19:36.472
WHO’S TO SAY THE SLASHER WON’T

00:19:36.472 --> 00:19:38.674
COME AFTER YOU AGAIN?

00:19:38.674 --> 00:19:39.842
YOU SHOULDN’T BE ALONE.

&gt;&gt; SHINGEN HAD IT?

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:54.031
WHY?

00:21:54.031 --> 00:21:56.400
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE, IT SAID THAT SAIKA’S

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.868
ABLE TO CUT SOULS.

00:21:57.868 --> 00:21:59.402

&gt;&gt; YES.

00:22:01.872 --> 00:22:03.539
HE’S THE ONE RESPONSIBLE.

00:22:03.539 --> 00:22:04.574
HE USED THE SAIKA TO STEAL YOUR

00:22:04.574 --> 00:22:05.675
HEAD.

00:22:05.675 --> 00:22:06.909
THAT’S HOW HE CUT THE SOUL THAT

HELD YOUR HEAD AND BODY

&gt;&gt; SORT OF.

00:22:15.517 --> 00:22:16.551

00:22:16.551 --> 00:22:17.786
TAKE YOUR HEAD WHEN I DID MY OWN

00:22:17.786 --> 00:22:19.788
RESEARCH LATER.

00:22:19.788 --> 00:22:20.922
I DIDN’T SAY ANYTHING AT

00:22:20.922 --> 00:22:22.491
FIRST BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE YOU

00:22:22.491 --> 00:22:23.625
WERE TRYING TO MOVE ON AND

00:22:23.625 --> 00:22:25.627
FORGET ABOUT YOUR HEAD.

00:22:25.627 --> 00:22:26.828
