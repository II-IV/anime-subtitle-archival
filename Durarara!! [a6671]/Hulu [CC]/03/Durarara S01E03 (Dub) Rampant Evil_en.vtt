00:08:15.597 --> 00:08:17.600
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE...SUZIE YASUDA’S

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.936
GONNA BE THERE TO DO A BOOK

00:08:18.936 --> 00:08:20.504
SIGNING TODAY!

00:08:20.504 --> 00:08:21.673
&gt;&gt; AH, KEEP THAT STUFF ON THE

00:08:21.673 --> 00:08:22.774
DOWN LOW, WILL YOU?

00:08:22.774 --> 00:08:23.775
&gt;&gt; HUH? WHAT FOR?

00:08:23.775 --> 00:08:24.810
I CAN’T GET ENOUGH OF SUZIE’S

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:25.311
BOOKS.

00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:25.945
&gt;&gt; THE DOLLARS?

00:08:25.945 --> 00:08:27.681
YEAH, I’VE HEARD OF THEM.

00:08:27.681 --> 00:08:29.350
&gt;&gt; A FRIEND OF MINE STARTED

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:30.818
TALKING ABOUT THEM TODAY.

00:08:30.818 --> 00:08:31.786
&gt;&gt; BUT...I’VE NEVER ACTUALLY

00:08:31.786 --> 00:08:33.789
SEEN THEM.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.659
DO THEY REALLY EXIST?

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:36.560
&gt;&gt; THINK IT’S SOME SORT OF

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.995
INTERNET PRANK?

00:08:37.995 --> 00:08:39.697
&gt;&gt; I DON’T KNOW FOR SURE.

00:08:39.697 --> 00:08:41.600
BUT IF THEY DO EXIST, I THINK

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.002
IT’S BEST TO STEER CLEAR OF

00:08:43.002 --> 00:08:44.671
GROUPS LIKE THAT.

00:08:44.671 --> 00:08:45.739
&gt;&gt; THE DOLLARS?

00:08:45.739 --> 00:08:47.408
THEY’VE GOT A CONTINUOUS DUEL

00:08:47.408 --> 00:08:49.077
WITH THE FLAME HAZE DEEP WITHIN

00:08:49.077 --> 00:08:50.913
THE SUB-BASEMENT OF SUNSHINE 60,

00:08:50.913 --> 00:08:51.747
RIGHT?

00:08:51.747 --> 00:08:53.483
&gt;&gt; YOU’VE GOT IT WRONG, YUMATCH.

00:08:53.483 --> 00:08:54.418
THAT’S THE ANGEL WHO FLIES

00:08:54.418 --> 00:08:55.586
THROUGH THE SKY, FLASHING HER

00:08:55.586 --> 00:08:56.854
PANTIES, SINGING, "PIPIRU, PIRU,

00:08:56.854 --> 00:08:57.855
PIRU."

00:08:57.855 --> 00:08:58.791
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ABOUT THE

00:08:58.791 --> 00:09:00.626
DOLLARS FOR, ANYWAY?

00:09:00.626 --> 00:09:01.761
&gt;&gt; UH, NOTHING.

00:09:01.761 --> 00:09:02.862
I WAS JUST CURIOUS.

00:09:02.862 --> 00:09:04.098
&gt;&gt; WHAT, DID THAT STORY YOU

00:09:04.098 --> 00:09:06.401
HEARD EARLIER SCARE YOU?

00:09:06.401 --> 00:09:07.068
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE A LOT OF RUMORS

00:09:07.068 --> 00:09:08.470
ABOUT THEM.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:09.405
WORD IS THEY’RE PRETTY

00:09:09.405 --> 00:09:10.707
DANGEROUS.

00:09:10.707 --> 00:09:11.641
&gt;&gt; WOW.

00:09:11.641 --> 00:09:12.542

00:09:12.542 --> 00:09:13.511
&gt;&gt; I WOULDN’T TRY AND GET NEAR

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:15.547
THEM JUST FOR KICKS.

00:09:15.547 --> 00:09:16.448
THE LESS YOU KNOW ABOUT THOSE

00:09:16.448 --> 00:09:17.883

00:09:17.883 --> 00:09:20.086

"PAPA"?

00:09:26.128 --> 00:09:27.363
&gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO. I THINK HE’S--

00:09:27.363 --> 00:09:28.431
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE PLACES IN THE CITY

00:09:28.431 --> 00:09:29.799
WHERE A GOOD PERSON SHOULD NEVER

00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:31.502
GO.

00:09:31.502 --> 00:09:33.805

00:09:35.441 --> 00:09:36.508
IT’S TRUE.

00:09:36.508 --> 00:09:37.377
ONCE TIME NOT ENOUGH TO KILL

00:09:37.377 --> 00:09:39.513

00:10:01.477 --> 00:10:02.812
&gt;&gt; SOMETIMES A PERSON CAN BE

SWALLOWED UP BY A CITY LIKE

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:08.887
THEIR TRACE.

CHARMING SMILE CAN BE

00:11:03.061 --> 00:11:04.029
INTIMIDATING, BUT HEY...

00:11:04.029 --> 00:11:05.097
&gt;&gt; AND THERE.

00:11:15.845 --> 00:11:17.247
&gt;&gt; WHAT HE WAS SEEKING WAS

00:11:17.247 --> 00:11:18.115
CHANGE.

00:11:18.115 --> 00:11:19.083

[laughter]

00:11:24.657 --> 00:11:25.726
&gt;&gt; THE POTENTIAL OF A NEW PLACE

00:11:25.726 --> 00:11:27.195
GAVE HIM HOPE THAT SOMETHING

00:11:27.195 --> 00:11:30.232
DIFFERENT MIGHT HAPPEN HERE.

00:11:30.232 --> 00:11:31.233
BUT WHAT WAS REALLY WAITING FOR

00:11:31.233 --> 00:11:34.170
HIM WAS THE DARK UNDERBELLY THAT

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:35.172
HIDES JUST BELOW THIS CITY’S

00:11:35.172 --> 00:11:37.675

00:11:37.675 --> 00:11:39.612
DOUBT BEGINS TO OVERTAKE HIM.

00:11:39.612 --> 00:11:41.180
HE STARTS QUESTIONING IF HE CAN

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.682
REALLY MAKE IT HERE.

00:11:42.682 --> 00:11:44.251
AND THEN HE GETS SCARED.

00:11:44.251 --> 00:11:46.187

00:11:46.187 --> 00:11:48.290
