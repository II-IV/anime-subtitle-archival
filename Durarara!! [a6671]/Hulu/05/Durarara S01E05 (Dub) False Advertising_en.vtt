00:07:51.212 --> 00:07:53.247
ANYTHING YOU WANT, OKAY?

00:07:53.247 --> 00:07:55.082
I KNOW--WHY DON’T I TAKE YOU

00:07:55.082 --> 00:07:56.917
HOME TODAY?

00:07:56.917 --> 00:07:57.951
DID YOU HEAR?

00:07:57.951 --> 00:07:59.720
THE SLASHER WAS IN IKEBUKURO

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.888
AGAIN.

00:08:00.888 --> 00:08:01.955
&gt;&gt; MM.

00:08:01.955 --> 00:08:03.290
&gt;&gt; MR. NASUJIMA, ARE YOU

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.992
SEXUALLY HARASSING HER?

00:08:04.992 --> 00:08:05.793
&gt;&gt; UH...

00:08:05.793 --> 00:08:07.060
&gt;&gt; UNH!

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.428
&gt;&gt; WOW, YOU SURE WERE GETTING

00:08:08.428 --> 00:08:09.862
PRETTY HANDSY THERE WITH OUR

00:08:09.862 --> 00:08:11.064
CLASS REP, TEACH.

00:08:11.064 --> 00:08:12.332
I MEAN, IF THAT WASN’T SEXUAL

00:08:12.332 --> 00:08:13.900
HARASSMENT, THEN I SURE DON’T

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.067
KNOW WHAT IS.

00:08:15.067 --> 00:08:16.403
SO YOU LIKE THE SEXY HOROSHO

00:08:16.403 --> 00:08:17.937
TYPES.

00:08:17.937 --> 00:08:18.871
&gt;&gt; KIDA, ENOUGH WITH THE

00:08:18.871 --> 00:08:20.139
CLOWNING.

00:08:20.139 --> 00:08:21.774
ANRI, I WOULDN’T WANT YOU TO GET

00:08:21.774 --> 00:08:22.809
THE WRONG IDEA AND START

00:08:22.809 --> 00:08:23.976
SPREADING RUMORS.

00:08:23.976 --> 00:08:25.144
&gt;&gt; DOES SHE REALLY SEEM LIKE THE

00:08:25.144 --> 00:08:26.879
GOSSIPY TYPE TO YOU?

00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:28.147
&gt;&gt; NO, YOU’VE GOT A POINT.

00:08:28.147 --> 00:08:29.115
YOU KIDS TAKE CARE.

00:08:29.115 --> 00:08:30.516
[chuckles]

00:08:30.516 --> 00:08:31.450
&gt;&gt; AND YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:32.118
ABOUT.

00:08:32.118 --> 00:08:33.419
THE ONLY ONE SPREADING RUMORS

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:34.086
WILL BE ME.

00:08:34.086 --> 00:08:37.456
&gt;&gt; OH! AAH!

00:08:37.456 --> 00:08:38.924
&gt;&gt; [chuckles] TOTALLY HEROIC,

00:08:38.924 --> 00:08:40.025
RIGHT?

00:08:40.025 --> 00:08:41.126
CAN YOU GET MORE AWESOME THAN

00:08:41.126 --> 00:08:42.193
ME?

00:08:42.193 --> 00:08:43.395
HOW CAN SHE NOT BE IN LOVE RIGHT

00:08:43.395 --> 00:08:44.129
NOW?

00:08:44.129 --> 00:08:46.464
&gt;&gt; MASAOMI, ANRI.

00:08:46.464 --> 00:08:47.966
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE THIS IS WHEN YOU

00:08:47.966 --> 00:08:49.267
WOULD SHOW UP.

00:08:54.105 --> 00:08:56.974
HERE YOU GO, ALL YOURS.

00:08:56.974 --> 00:09:00.511
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:02.213
&gt;&gt; HEY, SERIOUSLY, WATCH OUT FOR

00:09:02.213 --> 00:09:03.981
THAT GUY.

00:09:03.981 --> 00:09:05.350
HE’S BAD NEWS.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:06.951
MOST OF IT IS JUST RUMORS, BUT

00:09:06.951 --> 00:09:09.053
NASUJIMA REALLY DID GO AFTER A

00:09:09.053 --> 00:09:10.087
STUDENT ONCE.

00:09:10.087 --> 00:09:10.855
&gt;&gt; HE DID WHAT?

00:09:10.855 --> 00:09:11.822
&gt;&gt; YEAH, AN OLDER STUDENT NAMED

00:09:11.822 --> 00:09:13.257
HARUNA NIEKAWA.

00:09:13.257 --> 00:09:14.291
SHE TRANSFERRED OUT SECOND

00:09:14.291 --> 00:09:16.060
SEMESTER OF LAST YEAR.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:16.961
WORD ABOUT THEM DATING SPREAD

00:09:16.961 --> 00:09:18.462
QUICKLY, THEN THEY BROKE THINGS

00:09:18.462 --> 00:09:20.197
OFF SO HE WOULDN’T GET BUSTED.

00:09:20.197 --> 00:09:21.298
&gt;&gt; REALLY?

00:09:21.298 --> 00:09:22.799
&gt;&gt; MAYBE NASUJIMA OR THE SCHOOL

00:09:22.799 --> 00:09:23.967
MADE HER LEAVE, OR SHE LEFT ON

00:09:23.967 --> 00:09:25.034
HER OWN.

00:09:25.034 --> 00:09:26.102
EITHER WAY, SHE’S NOT HERE THIS

00:09:26.102 --> 00:09:27.270
YEAR.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.138
HEY, IF HE MESSES WITH YOU,

00:09:29.138 --> 00:09:30.339
MIKADO AND I WILL TAKE HIM OUT.

00:09:30.339 --> 00:09:31.407
WON’T WE, BUDDY?

00:09:31.407 --> 00:09:33.142
&gt;&gt; UH, YEAH.

00:09:33.142 --> 00:09:34.310
I’M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT I’M

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.279
SUPPOSED TO DO, BUT IF YOU NEED

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:37.981
MY HELP, I’M GLAD TO DO IT.

00:09:37.981 --> 00:09:39.182
&gt;&gt; DUDE, WRONG LINE.

00:09:39.182 --> 00:09:40.083
YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO BE ALL,

00:09:40.083 --> 00:09:41.250
"I DON’T KNOW WHAT I’M DOING,

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:42.551
BUT LOVE IS THE WIND BENEATH MY

00:09:42.551 --> 00:09:43.352
WINGS."

00:09:43.352 --> 00:09:44.053
[eats ice cream]

00:09:44.053 --> 00:09:45.388
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

00:09:45.388 --> 00:09:46.255
OTHERWISE YOU’RE A PUSS.

00:09:46.255 --> 00:09:47.990
&gt;&gt; HEY, HAVE SOME MANNERS.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:49.292
&gt;&gt; IT’S JUST THE TRUTH.

00:09:49.292 --> 00:09:50.993
&gt;&gt; ANYWAY, ABOUT THOSE GIRLS.

00:09:50.993 --> 00:09:51.460
&gt;&gt; HMM?

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:52.360
&gt;&gt; THE ONES THAT WERE BULLYING

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.028
YOU.

00:09:53.028 --> 00:09:54.029
THEY’RE FROM YOUR JUNIOR HIGH,

00:09:54.029 --> 00:09:54.530
RIGHT?

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:56.031
&gt;&gt; HOW--HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

00:09:56.031 --> 00:09:57.332
&gt;&gt; WELL, IT WAS JUST SOME OF THE

00:09:57.332 --> 00:09:59.067
THINGS THEY SAID TO YOU.

00:09:59.067 --> 00:10:00.135
IT SEEMED LIKE THERE MIGHT HAVE

00:10:00.135 --> 00:10:01.269
BEEN SOME OTHER GIRL AROUND WHO

00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:02.604
USED TO STICK UP FOR YOU.

00:10:02.604 --> 00:10:04.006
BUT I GUESS THAT GIRL’S GONE NOW

00:10:04.006 --> 00:10:05.573
AND SO THOSE GIRLS CAME BACK TO

00:10:05.573 --> 00:10:06.908
HARASS YOU AGAIN.

00:10:06.908 --> 00:10:07.909
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THAT’S RIGHT.

00:10:07.909 --> 00:10:08.843
A FRIEND OF YOURS WHO’S

00:10:08.843 --> 00:10:10.312
DISAPPEARED--STILL NO SIGN OF

00:10:10.312 --> 00:10:11.413
HER YET?

00:10:11.413 --> 00:10:12.514
&gt;&gt; IT’S MIKA HARIMA FROM OUR

00:10:12.514 --> 00:10:16.884
CLASS, RIGHT?

00:10:16.884 --> 00:10:17.919
&gt;&gt; THEY’RE SAYING THAT SHE’S

00:10:17.919 --> 00:10:19.286
JUST ABSENT FROM SCHOOL RIGHT

00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:21.055
NOW, BUT SHE’S BEEN MISSING

00:10:21.055 --> 00:10:22.156
SINCE BEFORE SCHOOL EVEN

00:10:22.156 --> 00:10:24.391
STARTED.

00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:25.359
&gt;&gt; SHOULDN’T WE TELL THE COPS

00:10:25.359 --> 00:10:26.928
ABOUT THIS?

00:10:26.928 --> 00:10:28.129
THE LAST I HEARD FROM HER, SHE

00:10:28.129 --> 00:10:29.430
HAD SENT A TEXT TO ME AND HER

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:30.464
FAMILY.

00:10:30.464 --> 00:10:31.965
SHE SAID HER HEART WAS BROKEN

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:33.133
AND SO SHE WAS TAKING A QUICK

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:35.168
TRIP AND NOT TO WORRY.

00:10:35.168 --> 00:10:36.202
&gt;&gt; HER HEART WAS BROKEN?

00:10:36.202 --> 00:10:37.504
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:10:37.504 --> 00:10:40.541
&gt;&gt; WELL, SHE--LISTEN, THIS MIGHT

00:10:40.541 --> 00:10:42.242
COME AS A BIT OF A SHOCK TO

00:10:42.242 --> 00:10:42.909
YOU--

00:10:42.909 --> 00:10:43.877
&gt;&gt; AFTER ALL I’VE SEEN THESE

00:10:43.877 --> 00:10:45.178
PAST FEW DAYS, I DOUBT ANYTHING

00:10:45.178 --> 00:10:47.047
CAN SHOCK ME.

00:10:47.047 --> 00:10:49.282
&gt;&gt; MY FRIEND MIKA...

00:10:49.282 --> 00:10:50.616
IS A STALKER.

00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:51.517
&gt;&gt; [coughs]

00:10:51.517 --> 00:10:52.885
BLAGH!

00:10:52.885 --> 00:10:54.487
&gt;&gt; GOTCHA, SO THAT GUY WE

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:55.621
OVERHEARD YOU TALKING TO

00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:58.624
EARLIER--MIKA WAS STALKING HIM.

00:10:58.624 --> 00:11:00.560
NO, SORRY, SHE WAS DEEPLY IN

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.094
LOVE WITH HIM AND HAD TO GO ON A

00:11:02.094 --> 00:11:03.295
TRIP BECAUSE HE REJECTED HER.

00:11:03.295 --> 00:11:04.429
&gt;&gt; MM-HMM.

00:11:04.429 --> 00:11:05.330
&gt;&gt; THAT’S AN ISSUE FOR HER

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.132
FAMILY, THEN, NOT YOU.

00:11:07.132 --> 00:11:08.400
IF SHE DOESN’T COME BACK SOON,

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.035
THEY’LL CALL THE COPS.

00:11:10.035 --> 00:11:11.470
&gt;&gt; MM.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.038
&gt;&gt; WERE THE TWO OF YOU CLOSE?

00:11:13.038 --> 00:11:14.139
WERE YOU GOOD FRIENDS?

00:11:14.139 --> 00:11:17.142
&gt;&gt; WHY IS HE ASKING HER THAT?

00:11:17.142 --> 00:11:18.677
&gt;&gt; WELL, WE WERE TOGETHER ALL

00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:20.078
THE TIME.

00:11:20.078 --> 00:11:22.080
&gt;&gt; WHOA, HIS INTUITION IS ODDLY

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.114
GOOD.

00:11:23.114 --> 00:11:24.148
&gt;&gt; I’M NOT NATURALLY VERY

00:11:24.148 --> 00:11:26.217
SOCIAL, BUT SHE DRAGGED ME ALONG

00:11:26.217 --> 00:11:28.052
WHEREVER SHE WENT.

00:11:28.052 --> 00:11:29.187
AND IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE OF HER

00:11:29.187 --> 00:11:31.122
I ACTUALLY MET PEOPLE.

00:11:31.122 --> 00:11:32.924
THEN WHEN I FOUND OUT SHE CHOSE

00:11:32.924 --> 00:11:35.193
THE SAME HIGH SCHOOL I DID,

00:11:35.193 --> 00:11:36.127
I ACTUALLY FELT KINDA GUILTY

00:11:36.127 --> 00:11:37.195
ABOUT IT.

00:11:37.195 --> 00:11:38.429
&gt;&gt; SO THEN--

00:11:38.429 --> 00:11:39.697
&gt;&gt; MIKADO, I KNOW WHAT YOU’RE

00:11:39.697 --> 00:11:41.465
THINKING--THAT MIKA ONLY KEPT

00:11:41.465 --> 00:11:43.166
ANRI AROUND TO MAKE HERSELF LOOK

00:11:43.166 --> 00:11:44.067
BETTER.

00:11:44.067 --> 00:11:45.636
BUT DUDE, DON’T SAY THAT.

00:11:45.636 --> 00:11:46.670
&gt;&gt; I KNOW.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:47.337
&gt;&gt; both: HUH?

00:11:47.337 --> 00:11:48.438
&gt;&gt; KNOW WHAT?

00:11:48.438 --> 00:11:50.073
&gt;&gt; THAT MIKA WAS ONLY USING ME

00:11:50.073 --> 00:11:51.474
TO MAKE HERSELF LOOK BETTER.

00:11:51.474 --> 00:11:53.210
BUT TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST,

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:54.677
I WAS USING HER TOO.

00:11:54.677 --> 00:11:56.413
DEPENDING ON HER MADE MY LIFE

00:11:56.413 --> 00:11:57.614
EASIER.

00:11:57.614 --> 00:11:58.715
PRETTY SOON I COULDN’T IMAGINE

00:11:58.715 --> 00:12:00.283
LIVING ANY OTHER WAY.

00:12:00.283 --> 00:12:01.118
&gt;&gt; UM...

00:12:01.118 --> 00:12:03.153
&gt;&gt; BUT NOW I THINK I’M OKAY.

00:12:03.153 --> 00:12:04.387
I’VE REALIZED THAT I DON’T

00:12:04.387 --> 00:12:06.122
REALLY NEED HER.

00:12:06.122 --> 00:12:07.557
I’M USED TO IT NOW.

00:12:07.557 --> 00:12:10.192
I’M DOING FINE WITHOUT HER.

00:12:10.192 --> 00:12:12.094
TO TELL YOU GUYS THE TRUTH,

00:12:12.094 --> 00:12:13.329
I ONLY ASKED TO BE CLASS REP

00:12:13.329 --> 00:12:14.697
BECAUSE THAT’S THE JOB SHE

00:12:14.697 --> 00:12:15.732
WANTED.

00:12:15.732 --> 00:12:17.399
I FIGURED I SHOULD JUST DO IT IN

00:12:17.399 --> 00:12:20.036
HER PLACE.

00:12:20.036 --> 00:12:21.403
I WANTED TO PROVE TO MYSELF THAT

00:12:21.403 --> 00:12:24.005
I CAN BE BETTER THAN SHE IS.

00:12:24.005 --> 00:12:25.341
YOU THINK I’M DEVIOUS, DON’T

00:12:25.341 --> 00:12:27.343
YOU?

00:12:27.343 --> 00:12:28.744
&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY I THINK IT’S DEVIOUS

00:12:28.744 --> 00:12:30.579
THAT YOU’RE TELLING US THIS.

00:12:30.579 --> 00:12:31.980
&gt;&gt; OH.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.214
&gt;&gt; IT KINDA SEEMS LIKE YOU’RE

00:12:33.214 --> 00:12:34.415
ASKING FOR OUR FORGIVENESS OR

00:12:34.415 --> 00:12:35.984
SOMETHING.

00:12:35.984 --> 00:12:36.752
THE FACT THAT YOU WANNA BE

00:12:36.752 --> 00:12:38.286
BETTER THAN HER IS NOT SOMETHING

00:12:38.286 --> 00:12:39.187
YOU SHOULD FEEL THE NEED TO

00:12:39.187 --> 00:12:40.155
DEFEND.

00:12:40.155 --> 00:12:41.222
IF YOU ASK ME, THAT’S SOMETHING

00:12:41.222 --> 00:12:42.290
YOU SHOULD REALLY OWN AND BE

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.292
PROUD OF.

00:12:44.292 --> 00:12:47.262
UH, BUT...

00:12:50.665 --> 00:12:52.367
&gt;&gt; YOU’RE SO RIGHT.

00:12:52.367 --> 00:12:54.334
THANK YOU, MIKADO.

00:12:54.334 --> 00:12:56.436
&gt;&gt; I’VE GOTTA SAY, I DO DIG THIS

00:12:56.436 --> 00:12:58.105
SIDE OF HIM.

00:12:58.105 --> 00:12:59.539
[giggles] YAA!

00:12:59.539 --> 00:13:00.407
&gt;&gt; AAH! OOF.

00:13:00.407 --> 00:13:01.475
&gt;&gt; [chuckles]

00:13:01.475 --> 00:13:02.542
&gt;&gt; MASAOMI.

00:13:02.542 --> 00:13:03.743
&gt;&gt; [laughs] YOU’RE LAME!

00:13:03.743 --> 00:13:06.613
&gt;&gt; WHY AM I LAME?

00:13:11.218 --> 00:13:12.552
&gt;&gt; WHAT? THE TOUGHEST GUY IN

00:13:12.552 --> 00:13:13.587
IKEBUKURO?

00:13:13.587 --> 00:13:15.021
&gt;&gt; YEAH, WHO IS IT?

00:13:15.021 --> 00:13:16.356
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH SOME MAGAZINE?

00:13:16.356 --> 00:13:18.758
TOUGHEST? HOW LAME ARE YOU?

00:13:18.758 --> 00:13:19.659
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHO I THINK IS THE

00:13:19.659 --> 00:13:20.727
MOST SCARY?

00:13:20.727 --> 00:13:22.028
THAT GUY ON THE BLACK BIKE.

00:13:22.028 --> 00:13:23.062
&gt;&gt; I KNOW HIM.

00:13:23.062 --> 00:13:24.698
HE’S, LIKE, GOT NO HEAD.

00:13:24.698 --> 00:13:26.032
&gt;&gt; NO WAY.

00:13:26.032 --> 00:13:27.300
&gt;&gt; BUT THEN AGAIN, THERE’S THAT

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.467
SLASHER.

00:13:28.467 --> 00:13:30.303
&gt;&gt; OH, RIGHT, YEAH.

00:13:30.303 --> 00:13:31.204
WOULDN’T YOU GUYS SAY THE

00:13:31.204 --> 00:13:32.471
DOLLARS ARE PRETTY HARD CORE

00:13:32.471 --> 00:13:33.672
RIGHT NOW?

00:13:33.672 --> 00:13:34.540
&gt;&gt; THE DOLLARS?

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:35.808
&gt;&gt; all: YEAH, THE DOLLARS.

00:13:35.808 --> 00:13:36.475
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:13:36.475 --> 00:13:38.210
&gt;&gt; THANKS FOR EVERYTHING TODAY.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:40.312
I SHOULD REALLY BE GETTING HOME.

00:13:40.312 --> 00:13:41.379
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, SEE YA.

00:13:41.379 --> 00:13:43.248
&gt;&gt; GOOD-BYE, MY DEAR ANRI.

00:13:43.248 --> 00:13:44.116
[laughs]

00:13:44.116 --> 00:13:45.117
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I STARTED THINKING.

00:13:45.117 --> 00:13:46.284
I’LL BET SEIJI AND HER FRIEND

00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:48.120
MIKA MIGHT ACTUALLY BE TOGETHER

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:48.787
RIGHT NOW.

00:13:48.787 --> 00:13:50.655
&gt;&gt; THE STALKER GOT THE STALKEE?

00:13:50.655 --> 00:13:52.124
&gt;&gt; I DON’T KNOW, I’M NOT SURE.

00:13:52.124 --> 00:13:53.258
MAYBE SHE KIDNAPPED HIM OR

00:13:53.258 --> 00:13:53.825
SOMETHING.

00:13:53.825 --> 00:13:54.792
&gt;&gt; MORE LIKELY.

00:13:54.792 --> 00:13:57.129
&gt;&gt; IF WE WANTED TO, HOW COULD WE

00:13:57.129 --> 00:13:57.829
FIND HER?

00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:59.096
&gt;&gt; I SAY DROP IT.

00:13:59.096 --> 00:14:00.365
ANRI SAID SHE’S FINE.

00:14:00.365 --> 00:14:01.232
&gt;&gt; YOU WOULD NEED A MASSIVE

00:14:01.232 --> 00:14:02.500
ORGANIZATION FOR SOMETHING LIKE

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.302
THIS, LIKE THE DOLLARS.

00:14:05.302 --> 00:14:06.804
&gt;&gt; MIKADO, DON’T TELL ME YOU’RE

00:14:06.804 --> 00:14:08.305
SERIOUSLY THINKING ABOUT JOINING

00:14:08.305 --> 00:14:09.306
THE DOLLARS.

00:14:09.306 --> 00:14:11.308
&gt;&gt; UH, NO. NO WAY.

00:14:11.308 --> 00:14:12.810
&gt;&gt; YOU DON’T WANT THAT.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:13.677
COLOR GANGS ARE THE KIND OF

00:14:13.677 --> 00:14:14.811
THING THAT YOU DO WHEN YOU’RE

00:14:14.811 --> 00:14:16.413
YOUNG, AND THEN JUST REGRET IT

00:14:16.413 --> 00:14:17.648
WHEN YOU’RE OLDER.

00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:19.150
&gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT YOU’VE GOTTA DO

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.284
CERTAIN THINGS WHEN YOU’RE

00:14:20.284 --> 00:14:21.117
YOUNG.

00:14:21.117 --> 00:14:22.453
&gt;&gt; DUDE, I’M TOTALLY SPENT

00:14:22.453 --> 00:14:23.119
RIGHT NOW.

00:14:23.119 --> 00:14:23.687
[can clangs]

00:14:23.687 --> 00:14:24.521
I AIN’T DOING NOTHING.

00:14:24.521 --> 00:14:25.856
&gt;&gt; I HAD SOME SERIOUS

00:14:25.856 --> 00:14:27.824
DEPRESSION GOIN’ ON BEFORE

00:14:27.824 --> 00:14:29.826
MIKADO CAME TO IKEBUKURO.

00:14:29.826 --> 00:14:31.828
I AM WHO I AM NOW ONLY BECAUSE

00:14:31.828 --> 00:14:33.396
A LOT OF PEOPLE HELPED ME OUT,

00:14:33.396 --> 00:14:35.165
AND ONE OF THEM WAS DEFINITELY

00:14:35.165 --> 00:14:37.100
MIKADO.

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.334
HE’S JUST KINDA DROPPED IN TO

00:14:38.334 --> 00:14:40.170
IKEBUKURO, AND I CAN TELL THE

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.172
CITY’S TOO MUCH FOR HIM.

00:14:42.172 --> 00:14:43.473
HE LOOKS SO VULNERABLE HERE,

00:14:43.473 --> 00:14:45.708
AND IT WORRIES ME.

00:14:45.708 --> 00:14:46.842
I COULD COOL HIM DOWN BY TAKING

00:14:46.842 --> 00:14:48.177
HIM TO PLACES A LITTLE MORE

00:14:48.177 --> 00:14:50.112
CHILL, BUT I SEE THAT LOOK IN

00:14:50.112 --> 00:14:51.547
HIS EYES AND I KNOW HE DIGS IT

00:14:51.547 --> 00:14:52.848
HERE.

00:14:52.848 --> 00:14:54.249
SO INSTEAD I JUST TRY TO STICK

00:14:54.249 --> 00:14:57.252
WITH HIM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

00:14:57.252 --> 00:14:59.688
IF I HAD MY WAY, HE’D NEVER HAVE

00:14:59.688 --> 00:15:00.855
TO SEE THE DARKNESS THAT LURKS

00:15:00.855 --> 00:15:03.658
IN THIS PLACE.

00:15:03.658 --> 00:15:06.761
AND NEITHER WOULD I.

00:15:06.761 --> 00:15:07.429
BANG.

00:15:07.429 --> 00:15:11.833
[water rushing]

00:15:11.833 --> 00:15:13.868
I PROMISED MYSELF THAT I WOULD

00:15:13.868 --> 00:15:16.237
NEVER GO THERE AGAIN.

00:15:22.376 --> 00:15:27.881
[police siren wailing]

00:15:34.888 --> 00:15:36.724
[police siren wailing]

00:15:36.724 --> 00:15:39.660
&gt;&gt; AAH!

00:15:40.894 --> 00:15:44.197
AAH!

00:15:54.173 --> 00:15:55.875
&gt;&gt; WAS THAT A TROLL JUST NOW?

00:15:55.875 --> 00:15:57.610
&gt;&gt; MORE LIKE AN ALIEN.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:58.811
&gt;&gt; MAYBE THEY WERE LAUGHING.

00:15:58.811 --> 00:15:59.946
&gt;&gt; SOUNDED PRETTY SCARY.

00:15:59.946 --> 00:16:00.880
&gt;&gt; BUT THEN, WHAT’S WITH THE

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:01.948
"HA-HA?"

00:16:01.948 --> 00:16:03.816
&gt;&gt; NO, I MEAN, ALIENS ARE SCARY.

00:16:03.816 --> 00:16:06.853
NOT THE OTHER GUY.

00:16:06.853 --> 00:16:07.753
&gt;&gt; TSUMI UTA?

00:16:07.753 --> 00:16:09.288
YOU KNOW THAT KANJI COULD READ

00:16:09.288 --> 00:16:12.258
"ZAIKA."

00:16:12.258 --> 00:16:12.958
&gt;&gt; AS IN "WEALTH"?

00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.526
&gt;&gt; I’LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT LATER.

00:16:14.526 --> 00:16:16.295
IN THE MEANTIME, YOU’VE GOT A

00:16:16.295 --> 00:16:17.329
JOB.

00:16:17.329 --> 00:16:18.530
IT’S FROM MR. SHIKI WITH THE

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.499
AWAKUSU, SO IT’S NOT ENTIRELY

00:16:20.499 --> 00:16:21.467
ON THE LEVEL.

00:16:21.467 --> 00:16:23.969
DO YOU STILL WANT IT?

00:16:23.969 --> 00:16:25.236
&gt;&gt; MORE TRANSPORTING?

00:16:25.236 --> 00:16:26.738
&gt;&gt; YUP, EXACTLY.

00:16:26.738 --> 00:16:27.638
BUT YOU’VE GOTTA GET THIS

00:16:27.638 --> 00:16:28.974
OBJECT BACK BEFORE YOU DELIVER

00:16:28.974 --> 00:16:30.375
IT.

00:16:30.375 --> 00:16:31.476
NOW I DIDN’T ASK HIM WHAT IT

00:16:31.476 --> 00:16:32.477
WAS.

00:16:32.477 --> 00:16:33.878
I’M GUESSING IT’S BEST FOR

00:16:33.878 --> 00:16:35.380
BOTH PARTIES IF I DON’T KNOW.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.381
&gt;&gt; I GOTCHA.

00:16:36.381 --> 00:16:38.649
&gt;&gt; GREAT, THEN ABOUT THE GOODS.

00:16:38.649 --> 00:16:39.884
SEEMS THE GUY WHO HAS IT KEEPS

00:16:39.884 --> 00:16:41.218
MOVING.

00:16:41.218 --> 00:16:42.219
WE’VE GOT GOOD INFO ON WHERE HE

00:16:42.219 --> 00:16:43.921
LIKES TO LAY LOW, SO FINDING HIM

00:16:43.921 --> 00:16:46.624
SHOULDN’T BE AN ISSUE, OKAY?

00:16:46.624 --> 00:16:50.460
&gt;&gt; GOT IT.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:51.361
&gt;&gt; THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE

00:16:51.361 --> 00:16:53.463
SPOTTINGS OF THE SLASHER LATELY.

00:16:53.463 --> 00:16:54.999
BE CAREFUL OUT THERE.

00:16:54.999 --> 00:16:56.566
&gt;&gt; SLASHER?

00:16:56.566 --> 00:16:58.235
&gt;&gt; UH-HUH, THAT’S WHAT I SAID.

00:16:58.235 --> 00:16:59.369
THAT SLASHER IS UNHINGED.

00:16:59.369 --> 00:17:00.237
&gt;&gt; THEY SAY IT COMES OUT OF

00:17:00.237 --> 00:17:02.339

00:17:02.339 --> 00:17:03.573
&gt;&gt; DUDE, HOW TOUGH CAN IT BE IF

00:17:03.573 --> 00:17:04.674
IT LETS YOU LIVE?

00:17:04.674 --> 00:17:06.275
THE FIERCEST GUY AROUND HERE HAS

00:17:06.275 --> 00:17:07.877
GOTTA BE SIMON FROM

00:17:07.877 --> 00:17:09.012

00:17:22.825 --> 00:17:23.926
GANG RIGHT NOW?

00:17:23.926 --> 00:17:25.294
THE DOLLARS, DUDE.

00:17:25.294 --> 00:17:26.662
&gt;&gt; THEY DON’T EVEN HAVE A COLOR.

00:17:26.662 --> 00:17:28.431
UP UNTIL LAST YEAR THOUGH IT WAS

00:17:28.431 --> 00:17:29.665
THOSE YELLOW BASTARDS.

00:17:29.665 --> 00:17:30.633

&gt;&gt; THEY WENT FULL TILT WITH A

00:17:34.569 --> 00:17:36.304
GANG CALLED THE BLUE SQUARES.

00:17:36.304 --> 00:17:37.339
IT WAS SO GNARLY IT WIPED OUT

00:17:37.339 --> 00:17:38.540
BOTH GANGS.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.342
&gt;&gt; NAH, WORD IS NOW THE YELLOW

00:17:40.342 --> 00:17:42.610

WE GOT ENGAWA AND SCALLOPS

00:17:48.516 --> 00:17:49.551
&gt;&gt; DOESN’T IT SEEM LIKE WE’VE

00:17:49.551 --> 00:17:50.952
BEEN SEEING HIM A LOT LATELY?

00:17:50.952 --> 00:17:51.753
&gt;&gt; SEEING WHAT?

00:17:51.753 --> 00:17:53.488

&gt;&gt; THE YELLOW SCARVES.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.027
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THAT’S IT.

00:18:00.027 --> 00:18:01.395
THAT ONE WAS A MESS.

00:18:03.464 --> 00:18:04.831
&gt;&gt; NAH, THOSE GUYS GOT THEIR

00:18:04.831 --> 00:18:06.400
ASSES HANDED TO THEM BY THE BLUE

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.868
SQUARES AND THEN DISSOLVED.

00:18:07.868 --> 00:18:08.869
&gt;&gt; THAT’S RIGHT, THEN THEIR BOSS

00:18:08.869 --> 00:18:10.504
BACKED OFF FROM THE GANG THING

00:18:10.504 --> 00:18:13.006
AND RETIRED OR SOMETHING.

00:18:13.006 --> 00:18:16.910
&gt;&gt; WELCOME, FRIEND.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.881
&gt;&gt; I WAS HOPING YOU COULD TELL

00:18:20.881 --> 00:18:22.716
ME ABOUT THE DOLLARS.

00:18:22.716 --> 00:18:23.049
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

00:18:23.049 --> 00:18:24.050
&gt;&gt; I’M TRYING TO KEEP A FRIEND

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:25.485
OF MINE FROM GETTING MIXED UP

00:18:25.485 --> 00:18:28.921
WITH THEM.

00:18:28.921 --> 00:18:29.889
&gt;&gt; WHY ARE YOU ASKING US?

00:18:29.889 --> 00:18:31.657
&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU’RE THE ONLY ONE I

00:18:31.657 --> 00:18:32.858
CAN TALK TO.

00:18:32.858 --> 00:18:33.826
&gt;&gt; GUESS YOU CAN’T REALLY ASK

00:18:33.826 --> 00:18:38.831
IZAYA ORIHARA ABOUT IT, HUH?

00:18:38.831 --> 00:18:40.332
&gt;&gt; LOOK, THEY’RE KIND OF A

00:18:40.332 --> 00:18:41.000
MYSTERY.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.001
WE DON’T KNOW A WHOLE LOT ABOUT

00:18:42.001 --> 00:18:43.368
THEM EITHER.

00:18:43.368 --> 00:18:44.837
BUT SINCE YOU’RE HERE, I’LL TELL

00:18:44.837 --> 00:18:46.906
YOU WHAT WE DO KNOW.

00:18:46.906 --> 00:18:48.874
&gt;&gt; SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE THIS

00:18:48.874 --> 00:18:51.510
TOWN WILL SWALLOW ME WHOLE.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:52.911
BUT I’LL NEVER LET THAT DARKNESS

00:19:17.568 --> 00:19:18.869
DORK, YOU JUST BUMPED INTO THE

00:19:18.869 --> 00:19:21.138

&gt;&gt; INTERESTING, YOU SAY YOU’RE

00:19:56.005 --> 00:19:56.973

00:19:58.707 --> 00:19:59.908

00:20:56.463 --> 00:20:57.997
&gt;&gt; I GUESS, TRUTH BE TOLD,

00:20:57.997 --> 00:20:58.965
I’M THE ONE WHO’S BECOME

00:20:58.965 --> 00:21:01.234
DEPENDENT UPON HIM.

00:21:01.234 --> 00:21:03.602
SINCE MIKADO CAME HERE, MY FALSE

00:21:03.602 --> 00:21:05.038
SENSE OF BRAVADO IS TURNING INTO

00:21:05.038 --> 00:21:07.506
SOMETHING REAL.

00:21:07.506 --> 00:21:09.708
MAYBE NEXT TIME I’LL BE ABLE TO

00:21:09.708 --> 00:21:10.609
SEE HER WITHOUT TURNING AND

00:21:10.609 --> 00:21:11.077
RUNNING AWAY.

00:21:11.077 --> 00:21:12.145
[knock on door]

00:21:12.145 --> 00:21:13.145
&gt;&gt; YES?

00:21:13.145 --> 00:21:14.613
&gt;&gt; I WASN’T SURE I COULD EVER

00:21:14.613 --> 00:21:18.250
FEEL LIKE THIS.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:19.752
&gt;&gt; WOW, I DIDN’T THINK YOU’D

00:21:19.752 --> 00:21:23.088
COME HERE AGAIN.

00:21:23.088 --> 00:21:24.622
HI, IZAYA.

00:21:24.622 --> 00:21:27.725
&gt;&gt; HELLO.

00:21:27.725 --> 00:21:29.061
SO HOW IS HE?

00:21:29.061 --> 00:21:30.862
&gt;&gt; WELL, HE DOES COME BY HERE

00:21:30.862 --> 00:21:33.831
SOMETIMES, BUT THAT’S AS FAR AS

00:21:33.831 --> 00:21:36.033
HE GOES.

00:21:36.033 --> 00:21:37.101
MM.

00:21:46.978 --> 00:21:50.681
&gt;&gt; I’M BACK.

00:21:50.681 --> 00:21:52.849
HARUNA, HAVE YOU EATEN YET?

00:21:52.849 --> 00:21:55.152
HARUNA?

00:21:55.152 --> 00:21:57.654
[typing on keyboard]

00:22:02.258 --> 00:22:04.294
&gt;&gt; SO I BANNED THAT TROLL WHO

00:22:04.294 --> 00:22:06.029
WAS BOTHERING US.

00:22:06.029 --> 00:22:06.897
&gt;&gt; THINGS SHOULD GO BACK TO

00:22:06.897 --> 00:22:07.764
NORMAL.

00:22:07.764 --> 00:22:09.232
&gt;&gt; LET’S HOPE SO.

00:22:09.232 --> 00:22:10.133
&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU HEARD THE LATEST

00:22:10.133 --> 00:22:11.201
ABOUT THE YELLOW SCARVES?

00:22:11.201 --> 00:22:12.535
THEY GOT HIT BY THE SLASHER

00:22:12.535 --> 00:22:13.269
YESTERDAY.

00:22:13.269 --> 00:22:15.305
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE THE YELLOW SCARVES?

00:22:15.305 --> 00:22:16.872
&gt;&gt; I WONDER IF THE SLASHER IS

00:22:16.872 --> 00:22:18.074
PART OF THE DOLLARS.

00:22:18.074 --> 00:22:19.309
&gt;&gt; THEY CAN’T BE.

00:22:19.309 --> 00:22:22.912
&gt;&gt; THERE MIGHT BE A WAR BREWING.

00:22:22.912 --> 00:22:23.946
&gt;&gt; IT MAY NOT LOOK LIKE IT AT

00:22:23.946 --> 00:22:25.581
FIRST, BUT EVERYTHING THAT

00:22:25.581 --> 00:22:27.282
HAPPENS IN THIS TOWN IS SOMEHOW

00:22:27.282 --> 00:22:28.183
RELATED.

00:22:28.183 --> 00:22:29.819

AWFUL TRUTH THAT’S BEYOND OUR

00:22:32.154 --> 00:22:34.089
COMPREHENSION.

00:22:34.089 --> 00:22:34.957

00:22:43.798 --> 00:22:45.300
THIS, BUT I’M OKAY WITH THIS

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.302
