00:07:58.782 --> 00:08:01.251
IS BEHIND IT ALL.

00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:03.987
&gt;&gt; [gasps]

00:08:03.987 --> 00:08:05.088
&gt;&gt; I DON’T THINK THE DOLLARS ARE

00:08:05.088 --> 00:08:06.356
MAKING THAT BIG OF A DEAL ABOUT

00:08:06.356 --> 00:08:07.990
IT.

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.092
NEITHER SIDE REALLY KNOWS EACH

00:08:09.092 --> 00:08:10.159
OTHER, SO THAT’S CREATING

00:08:10.159 --> 00:08:12.294
CONFUSION.

00:08:12.294 --> 00:08:13.328
&gt;&gt; DOESN’T MATTER.

00:08:13.328 --> 00:08:14.764
IF THE TWO OF THEM DON’T TAKE

00:08:14.764 --> 00:08:15.865
MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS AND

00:08:15.865 --> 00:08:16.966
FIND OUT WHO THE SLASHER REALLY

00:08:16.966 --> 00:08:18.067
IS, THEN ALL HELL’S GONNA BREAK

00:08:18.067 --> 00:08:20.969
LOOSE IN IKEBUKURO.

00:08:20.969 --> 00:08:22.171
&gt;&gt; SCARY STUFF.

00:08:22.171 --> 00:08:24.172
THIS COULD BE A REAL GANG WAR.

00:08:30.078 --> 00:08:32.280
&gt;&gt; DON’T WORRY, ANRI, IT’S OKAY.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.381
IT’S NOT YOUR FAULT THOSE GANGS

00:08:33.381 --> 00:08:35.849
ARE OUT OF CONTROL.

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:36.850
YOU WEREN’T THE ONE WHO DID ALL

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:37.785
THOSE ATTACKS.

00:08:37.785 --> 00:08:38.752
THERE’S NO REASON TO TURN

00:08:38.752 --> 00:08:40.020
YOURSELF IN.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.889
DON’T DO ANYTHING RASH.

00:08:41.889 --> 00:08:42.990
THE COPS HAVE BEEN PRETTY SCARY

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:44.992
LATELY.

00:08:44.992 --> 00:08:46.859
I MEAN, REALLY SCARY.

00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:48.195
THEY’RE JUST PLAIN FRIGHTENING!

00:08:48.195 --> 00:08:52.031
LIKE THOSE BIKE COPS.

00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:55.067
&gt;&gt; OH, OKAY, THANKS FOR THE TIP.

00:08:55.067 --> 00:08:57.203
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:58.304
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:08:58.304 --> 00:09:00.406
OH, RIGHT.

00:09:00.406 --> 00:09:01.873
NEXT TIME, I’LL TEACH YOU HOW TO

00:09:01.873 --> 00:09:05.110
USE THE PRIVATE MESSAGE MODE.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:06.377
&gt;&gt; SORRY, BUT I REALLY HAVE TO

00:09:06.377 --> 00:09:08.146
GET GOING NOW.

00:09:08.146 --> 00:09:09.114
&gt;&gt; OH, OKAY.

00:09:09.114 --> 00:09:11.049
GOODNIGHT, SAIKA, TAKE IT EASY.

00:09:11.049 --> 00:09:12.117
&gt;&gt; NIGHT.

00:09:12.117 --> 00:09:16.353
&gt;&gt; BYE.

00:09:16.353 --> 00:09:19.156
WELL, I HAVE TO GET GOING, TOO.

00:09:19.156 --> 00:09:20.124
&gt;&gt; GOODNIGHT.

00:09:20.124 --> 00:09:23.994
&gt;&gt; SEE YA LATER.

00:09:23.994 --> 00:09:25.061
&gt;&gt; HEY, KANRA, ABOUT THE

00:09:25.061 --> 00:09:26.896
SLASHER--

00:09:26.896 --> 00:09:28.131
&gt;&gt; I’LL LET YOU KNOW IF I HEAR

00:09:28.131 --> 00:09:28.998
ANYTHING.

00:09:28.998 --> 00:09:34.103
AND I’LL CUT YOU A GOOD RATE.

00:09:34.103 --> 00:09:35.171
IF THE SLASHER IS CAUGHT, THEN

00:09:35.171 --> 00:09:36.239
MAYBE TENSIONS WILL EASE BETWEEN

00:09:36.239 --> 00:09:37.340
THE DOLLARS AND THE YELLOW

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.242
SCARVES.

00:09:40.242 --> 00:09:43.378
&gt;&gt; [groans]

00:09:43.378 --> 00:09:44.847
&gt;&gt; I DON’T KNOW IF IT’LL BE THAT

00:09:44.847 --> 00:09:46.014
EASY.

00:09:46.014 --> 00:09:47.115
NEITHER THE DOLLARS NOR THE

00:09:47.115 --> 00:09:48.183
YELLOW SCARVES BEHAVE LIKE TRULY

00:09:48.183 --> 00:09:49.984
COHESIVE GROUPS.

00:09:49.984 --> 00:09:51.219
I BET SOME OF THEM WILL USE THE

00:09:51.219 --> 00:09:52.320
CURRENT TENSIONS AS AN EXCUSE TO

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.421
JUMP THE OTHER GANG WHENEVER

00:09:53.421 --> 00:09:54.956
THEY WANT.

00:09:54.956 --> 00:09:55.990
&gt;&gt; [chuckling]

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:57.058
&gt;&gt; [panting]

00:09:57.058 --> 00:10:00.394
[sirens]

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:04.898
&gt;&gt; IF IT GETS TO THAT POINT,

00:10:04.898 --> 00:10:06.166
THEN A REAL GANG WAR IS

00:10:06.166 --> 00:10:08.034
INEVITABLE.

00:10:08.034 --> 00:10:09.469
&gt;&gt; THEN I WON’T LET IT GET TO

00:10:09.469 --> 00:10:10.570
THAT POINT.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:11.471
&gt;&gt; REALLY?

00:10:11.471 --> 00:10:12.906
YOU MAY BE PAST THE POINT OF NO

00:10:12.906 --> 00:10:14.074
RETURN ALREADY.

00:10:14.074 --> 00:10:15.341
AND IF NOT, YOU HAVE NO CONTROL

00:10:15.341 --> 00:10:18.143
OVER THE YELLOW SCARVES.

00:10:18.143 --> 00:10:19.178
&gt;&gt; IT DOESN’T MATTER.

00:10:19.178 --> 00:10:20.580
I’LL STOP IT.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:24.884
&gt;&gt; WELL, I HOPE YOU DO.

00:10:24.884 --> 00:10:25.985
&gt;&gt; "I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING,"

00:10:25.985 --> 00:10:27.086
THOUGHT THE GIRL WITH THE

00:10:27.086 --> 00:10:30.255
DEMONIC BLADE UNDER HER SKIN.

00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:31.523
"I HAVE TO ACT," THOUGHT THE

00:10:31.523 --> 00:10:32.824
GIRL WHO’D WATCHED THE WORLD

00:10:32.824 --> 00:10:35.827
PASS BEFORE HER LIKE A MOVIE.

00:10:35.827 --> 00:10:38.896
BUT...

00:10:38.896 --> 00:10:39.998
THE BOY WHO’D PASSED THROUGH HER

00:10:39.998 --> 00:10:41.265
MOVIE AND HAD NOW LANDED A

00:10:41.265 --> 00:10:47.104
REGULAR ROLE, HE WAS TRAPPED--

00:10:47.104 --> 00:10:48.371
BOUND BY THE HEAVY CHAINS OF HIS

00:10:48.371 --> 00:10:50.040
OWN PAST.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.841
[phone chirps]

00:10:51.841 --> 00:10:53.043
&gt;&gt; [sighs]

00:10:53.043 --> 00:10:54.177
[ringing again]

00:10:54.177 --> 00:10:55.278
&gt;&gt; ESCAPE WAS NO LONGER AN

00:10:55.278 --> 00:10:58.314
OPTION.

00:11:06.522 --> 00:11:09.224
[phone ringing]

00:11:09.224 --> 00:11:10.992
&gt;&gt; WHAT’S UP?

00:11:10.992 --> 00:11:11.493
GOTCHA.

00:11:11.493 --> 00:11:13.028
OKAY, I’LL BE RIGHT THERE.

00:11:13.028 --> 00:11:14.863
HANG TIGHT.

00:11:14.863 --> 00:11:16.464
SORRY, HAVE TO SPLIT.

00:11:16.464 --> 00:11:17.565
I GOT A FRIEND IN NEED.

00:11:17.565 --> 00:11:18.966
&gt;&gt; WHAT? YOU’RE LEAVING?

00:11:18.966 --> 00:11:20.235
&gt;&gt; HEY, IF YOU NEED TO BLAME

00:11:20.235 --> 00:11:21.336
SOMEONE, BLAME MY FRIEND ALL YOU

00:11:21.336 --> 00:11:22.870
WANT.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:23.938
BLAMING A PERSON IS FREE AND IT

00:11:23.938 --> 00:11:25.505
CAUSES ME NO HARM.

00:11:25.505 --> 00:11:26.974
IT’S JUST LIKE TWO WIVES FOR ONE

00:11:26.974 --> 00:11:28.008
DUDE.

00:11:28.008 --> 00:11:29.309
LONG LIVE POLYGAMY!

00:11:29.309 --> 00:11:31.045
&gt;&gt; POLYGA-WHAT?

00:11:31.045 --> 00:11:31.945
&gt;&gt; LATES, PEEPS.

00:11:31.945 --> 00:11:34.414
SEE YA TOMORROW!

00:11:34.414 --> 00:11:35.148
&gt;&gt; [sighs]

00:11:35.148 --> 00:11:37.050
I WONDER WHAT’S SO IMPORTANT.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:38.117
&gt;&gt; DON’T YOU THINK MASAOMI’S

00:11:38.117 --> 00:11:39.218
BEEN ACTING KIND OF WEIRD

00:11:39.218 --> 00:11:40.619
LATELY?

00:11:40.619 --> 00:11:41.287
&gt;&gt; REALLY?

00:11:41.287 --> 00:11:43.889
MAYBE YOU’RE OVERTHINKING IT.

00:11:43.889 --> 00:11:48.160
MM, UH...HM.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.062
&gt;&gt; UM, I’M SORRY.

00:11:50.062 --> 00:11:52.197
I HAVE TO GO DO SOMETHING TODAY.

00:11:52.197 --> 00:11:53.065
BYE.

00:11:53.065 --> 00:11:56.268
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:11:56.268 --> 00:11:57.535
&gt;&gt; HEY, I HEARD SOME GUYS FORM

00:11:57.535 --> 00:11:59.003
THE DOLLARS GOT JUMPED BY THE

00:11:59.003 --> 00:12:00.372
YELLOW SCARVES LAST NIGHT.

00:12:00.372 --> 00:12:01.038
&gt;&gt; OH.

00:12:01.038 --> 00:12:02.306
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I HEARD IT WAS AN

00:12:02.306 --> 00:12:03.040
AMBUSH.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.676
ONE OF ’EM ALMOST GOT KILLED.

00:12:04.676 --> 00:12:05.943
&gt;&gt; THE YELLOW SCARVES ARE SAYING

00:12:05.943 --> 00:12:07.011
THAT THE DOLLARS ARE THE ONES

00:12:07.011 --> 00:12:10.914
BEHIND THE SLASHER ATTACKS.

00:12:10.914 --> 00:12:12.949
&gt;&gt; SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE.

00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:14.017
THE BOY WHO LED THE DOLLARS KNEW

00:12:14.017 --> 00:12:16.419
THIS.

00:12:16.419 --> 00:12:18.054
BUT HE STILL HAD NO IDEA THAT HE

00:12:18.054 --> 00:12:19.122
WAS JUST ANOTHER PAWN ON THE

00:12:19.122 --> 00:12:21.957
CHESS BOARD.

00:12:21.957 --> 00:12:23.025
&gt;&gt; TO ALL GOOD CUSTOMERS, COME,

00:12:23.025 --> 00:12:25.027
EAT SUSHI.

00:12:25.027 --> 00:12:26.996
SUSHI IS THE SOUL OF JAPAN.

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:28.230
SOUL MUSIC!

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:29.498
&gt;&gt; I WONDER IF IT’S TRUE THAT

00:12:29.498 --> 00:12:30.966
SIMON DOES A COSSACK DANCE WHEN

00:12:30.966 --> 00:12:32.601
HE DELIVERS SOMEONE’S SUSHI.

00:12:32.601 --> 00:12:34.069
&gt;&gt; THOSE KIDS WERE LUCKY.

00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:35.337
IF SIMON HADN’T BEEN OUT ON

00:12:35.337 --> 00:12:39.541
DELIVERY LAST NIGHT...

00:12:39.541 --> 00:12:40.642
&gt;&gt; SWING THAT PIPE AND YOU’LL BE

00:12:40.642 --> 00:12:41.943
THE MAIN INGREDIENT AT SUSHI

00:12:41.943 --> 00:12:43.177
BAR.

00:12:43.177 --> 00:12:44.512
HUMAN SUSHI.

00:12:44.512 --> 00:12:45.947
IT NO FEEL GOOD NOR TASTE GOOD

00:12:45.947 --> 00:12:48.316
EITHER.

00:12:48.316 --> 00:12:50.451
&gt;&gt; LUCK--SOMETHING THAT ALWAYS

00:12:50.451 --> 00:12:52.620
RUNS OUT IN THE END.

00:12:55.522 --> 00:12:56.623
MAN, THINGS ARE NOT LOOKING

00:12:56.623 --> 00:13:00.327
GOOD.

00:13:05.498 --> 00:13:06.566
&gt;&gt; DOES ANYONE HAVE INFORMATION

00:13:06.566 --> 00:13:08.034
ON THE DOLLARS OR THE YELLOW

00:13:08.034 --> 00:13:09.735
SCARVES?

00:13:09.735 --> 00:13:14.039
ANYONE?

00:13:14.039 --> 00:13:16.375
&gt;&gt; OUR BOSS IS MASAOMI KIDA.

00:13:16.375 --> 00:13:17.643
I’VE SEEN THE TWO OF YOU

00:13:17.643 --> 00:13:20.311
TOGETHER BEFORE, MOTHER.

00:13:20.311 --> 00:13:21.746
&gt;&gt; HE SAID THAT HE WAS OUT TO

00:13:21.746 --> 00:13:23.014
GET REVENGE FOR YOU, HIS GOOD

00:13:23.014 --> 00:13:25.250
FRIEND.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:27.051
&gt;&gt; OH, NO.

00:13:27.051 --> 00:13:28.319
&gt;&gt; IT WAS HARD FOR HER TO

00:13:28.319 --> 00:13:29.420
BELIEVE.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:30.521
BUT SHE KNEW THE CHILDREN COULD

00:13:30.521 --> 00:13:32.022
NOT LIE TO HER.

00:13:32.022 --> 00:13:34.024
SHE WAS THEIR MOTHER.

00:13:34.024 --> 00:13:35.192
&gt;&gt; WHERE IS HE NOW?

00:13:35.192 --> 00:13:36.460
&gt;&gt; HE SHOULD BE AT THE MEETING

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.595
TODAY.

00:13:38.595 --> 00:13:39.696
&gt;&gt; FINE. PLEASE TAKE ME TO WHERE

00:13:39.696 --> 00:13:41.298
THAT IS.

00:13:41.298 --> 00:13:42.065
[thunder booming]

00:13:42.065 --> 00:13:47.070
&gt;&gt; AND THEN...

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:51.707
SHE FINALLY KNEW EVERYTHING.

00:13:51.707 --> 00:13:52.675
&gt;&gt; MASAOMI...

00:13:52.675 --> 00:13:58.080
&gt;&gt; HEY, THINK SHE’S BACK HERE?

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:58.714
&gt;&gt; SHE HAD TO RUN.

00:13:58.714 --> 00:14:00.248
&gt;&gt; IT’S QUITE SIMPLE.

00:14:00.248 --> 00:14:01.083
&gt;&gt; WHY IS MASAOMI--

00:14:01.083 --> 00:14:02.784
[voices echoing]

00:14:02.784 --> 00:14:03.451
&gt;&gt; ALL OF THEM.

00:14:03.451 --> 00:14:04.352
&gt;&gt; CUT THEM UP AND LOVE THEM.

00:14:04.352 --> 00:14:05.253
&gt;&gt; CUT THEM UP AND LOVE THEM.

00:14:05.253 --> 00:14:06.354
&gt;&gt; I’LL LOVE THEM FOR YOU.

00:14:06.354 --> 00:14:08.155
MASAOMI KIDA.

00:14:08.155 --> 00:14:09.256
&gt;&gt; WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF SHE GOT

00:14:09.256 --> 00:14:10.557
CAUGHT?

00:14:10.557 --> 00:14:11.625
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU CAN’T LOVE

00:14:11.625 --> 00:14:12.493
OTHERS.

00:14:12.493 --> 00:14:13.194
I LOVE THEM.

00:14:13.194 --> 00:14:14.128
&gt;&gt; I’LL LOVE THEM FOR YOU.

00:14:14.128 --> 00:14:14.595
MASAOMI KIDA.

00:14:14.595 --> 00:14:15.496
&gt;&gt; CUT THEM UP AND LOVE THEM.

00:14:15.496 --> 00:14:18.031
&gt;&gt; I DON’T WANT TO HURT ANYONE.

00:14:18.031 --> 00:14:19.099
&gt;&gt; THE BOY WOULD FIND OUT THAT

00:14:19.099 --> 00:14:20.534
SHE’S A MONSTER.

00:14:20.534 --> 00:14:21.635
AND THAT THOUGHT MADE HER

00:14:21.635 --> 00:14:23.103
TREMBLE WITH FEAR.

00:14:23.103 --> 00:14:23.770

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:25.038

[phone chiming]

00:14:47.358 --> 00:14:48.426
&gt;&gt; CORNERED AND TRAPPED, SHE HAD

00:14:48.426 --> 00:14:50.294
ONLY ONE CHOICE--

00:14:50.294 --> 00:14:51.562
TO SEEK HELP FROM SOMEONE JUST

00:14:51.562 --> 00:14:52.663
LIKE HER, SOMEONE ELSE WHO

00:14:52.663 --> 00:14:57.067
DIDN’T BELONG IN THIS WORLD.

00:14:57.067 --> 00:14:58.168
&gt;&gt; THAT THING JUST USED ITS

00:14:58.168 --> 00:14:59.637
FREAKING BIKE TO SCALE THE WALL!

00:15:52.185 --> 00:15:53.286
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THERE WERE WAY

00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:54.353
TOO MANY CURVES IN THAT RIDING

00:15:54.353 --> 00:15:55.621
OUTFIT YOU WEAR FOR YOU TO

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:57.256
ACTUALLY BE A GUY.

00:15:58.524 --> 00:15:59.392
FOR ME,

00:15:59.392 --> 00:16:01.193
BUT IF YOU ARE A GIRL, I COULD

00:16:01.193 --> 00:16:02.127
EASILY FALL IN LOVE WITH THAT

00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:02.695

00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:03.428
IT’S HOT.

00:16:03.428 --> 00:16:04.863

&gt;&gt; OH, I SEE.

00:16:13.371 --> 00:16:14.639
SHE DOESN’T WANT HIM TO SEE HER

00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:15.707

00:16:15.707 --> 00:16:17.174
I DON’T KNOW WHAT’S GOING ON,

00:16:17.174 --> 00:16:17.842
BUT I GET IT.

&gt;&gt; NO, DON’T!

00:16:50.705 --> 00:16:51.806
&gt;&gt; SHE LOOKED JUST LIKE THE

00:16:51.806 --> 00:16:56.310
HEADLESS KNIGHT OF THE LEGENDS.

00:17:01.949 --> 00:17:05.686
[hoofbeats]

00:17:05.686 --> 00:17:06.754
&gt;&gt; THE SCRAPS OF INFORMATION

00:17:06.754 --> 00:17:07.855
THEY HAD ALL STARTED COMING

00:17:07.855 --> 00:17:09.656
TOGETHER.

00:17:09.656 --> 00:17:10.757
THE INTRUDER CARRIED A SWORD

00:17:10.757 --> 00:17:13.326
MUCH LIKE THE SLASHER’S.

00:17:13.326 --> 00:17:14.261
THE BLACK BIKE, LONG RUMORED TO

00:17:14.261 --> 00:17:15.362
BE PART OF THE DOLLARS, SUDDENLY

00:17:15.362 --> 00:17:19.298
CAME TO HER RESCUE.

00:17:19.298 --> 00:17:20.199
THEY ALL REACHED THE SAME

00:17:20.199 --> 00:17:22.334
CONCLUSION.

00:17:22.334 --> 00:17:23.402
THE SLASHER WAS PART OF THE

00:17:23.402 --> 00:17:25.637
DOLLARS.

00:17:25.637 --> 00:17:26.738
THE BOY WASN’T ABSOLUTELY SURE

00:17:26.738 --> 00:17:29.675
IF HIS CONCLUSION WAS RIGHT.

00:17:29.675 --> 00:17:30.776
BUT HE REALIZED THAT DIDN’T

00:17:30.776 --> 00:17:31.777
MATTER.

00:17:31.777 --> 00:17:32.878
BECAUSE REGARDLESS OF WHAT HE

00:17:32.878 --> 00:17:35.280
THOUGHT, HE NOW KNEW HE’D NO

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.747
LONGER BE ABLE TO HOLD HIS

00:17:36.747 --> 00:17:38.649

NO. WHAT?

00:17:44.254 --> 00:17:45.322
&gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO THE LEGENDS,

00:17:45.322 --> 00:17:46.691
IT’S A HEADLESS KNIGHT.

00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:47.958
AND IT RIDES AROUND ON A

00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:49.226
HEADLESS HORSE, VISITING THOSE

00:17:49.226 --> 00:17:51.228

00:17:51.228 --> 00:17:52.329
IT’S BASICALLY JUST LIKE THE

GRIM REAPER.

00:17:54.998 --> 00:17:57.300
&gt;&gt; SUDDENLY, IT CAME TO HIM.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:01.971
SOME OF THEM MIGHT DIE.

00:18:01.971 --> 00:18:03.272
WHY IS THAT?

00:18:03.272 --> 00:18:04.573
WHY DO TIMES LIKE THIS MAKE ME

00:18:04.573 --> 00:18:10.345
WANT TO SEE SAKI?

00:18:10.345 --> 00:18:11.446

MEANING EVERYTHING IS FALLING"

READ THE BANNER WHEN THE ARMY OF

00:18:15.783 --> 00:18:17.252
THE YELLOW SCARVES ROSE IN THE

00:18:17.252 --> 00:18:19.294
STORY OF THE THREE KINGDOMS.

00:18:23.257 --> 00:18:25.927
&gt;&gt; THE SKY AIN’T BLUE YET.

00:18:25.927 --> 00:18:27.028
THEN AGAIN, IT ISN’T YELLOW

00:18:27.028 --> 00:18:28.495
EITHER.

00:18:31.031 --> 00:18:32.733
&gt;&gt; GOOD EVENING.

&gt;&gt; STRAIGHT TO PRIVATE MESSAGE,

00:18:37.971 --> 00:18:39.605
HUH?

00:18:39.605 --> 00:18:40.706
&gt;&gt; THERE’S SOMETHING I NEED TO

00:18:40.706 --> 00:18:41.707
ASK YOU.

00:18:41.707 --> 00:18:42.808
UM, HAVE THE YELLOW SCARVES BEEN

00:18:42.808 --> 00:18:46.011
IN IKEBUKURO FOR A WHILE NOW?

00:18:46.011 --> 00:18:47.312
&gt;&gt; WELL, FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS

00:18:47.312 --> 00:18:48.614
OR SO.

00:18:48.614 --> 00:18:49.882
AT FIRST, THEY WERE A QUIET

00:18:49.882 --> 00:18:53.818
LITTLE GROUP.

00:18:53.818 --> 00:18:54.886
&gt;&gt; THE BOY WHO LED THE DOLLARS

00:18:54.886 --> 00:18:55.987
LEARNED OF THE HORRIBLE FIGHT

00:18:55.987 --> 00:18:57.289
BETWEEN THE YELLOW SCARVES AND

00:18:57.289 --> 00:18:59.991
THE BLUE SQUARES,

00:18:59.991 --> 00:19:01.059
NEVER KNOWING THE GIRL

00:19:01.059 --> 00:19:02.393
SACRIFICED WAS THE FORMER

00:19:02.393 --> 00:19:05.964
GIRLFRIEND OF HIS BEST FRIEND.

00:19:05.964 --> 00:19:07.065
AND UNAWARE THAT THE PERSON

00:19:07.065 --> 00:19:08.332
TELLING HIM THIS WAS THE SAME

00:19:08.332 --> 00:19:09.433
MAN WHO CONTROLLED THAT GIRL’S

00:19:09.433 --> 00:19:10.501
MIND, AND HAD PERMANENTLY

00:19:10.501 --> 00:19:14.905
SCARRED HIS BEST FRIEND.

00:19:14.905 --> 00:19:15.973
&gt;&gt; SO THE ONLY ONES LEFT WERE

00:19:15.973 --> 00:19:17.340
THE YELLOW SCARVES.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.075
&gt;&gt; NOT REALLY.

00:19:18.075 --> 00:19:19.076
THE BLUE SQUARES DIDN’T ACTUALLY

00:19:19.076 --> 00:19:21.811
GO AWAY.

00:19:21.811 --> 00:19:23.079
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:24.381
&gt;&gt; THE LEADER OF THE YELLOW

00:19:24.381 --> 00:19:25.482
SCARVES GOT SICK OF FIGHTING AND

00:19:25.482 --> 00:19:26.015
LEFT.

00:19:26.015 --> 00:19:27.917
AND THEN AFTER HE WAS GONE,

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:29.018
MOST OF THE BLUE SQUARES JOINED

00:19:29.018 --> 00:19:30.619
THE YELLOW SCARVES.

00:19:30.619 --> 00:19:31.687
&gt;&gt; SO BASICALLY THEY JUST

00:19:31.687 --> 00:19:32.988
MERGED?

00:19:32.988 --> 00:19:34.990
&gt;&gt; YEAH, BASICALLY.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:36.057
WITH THE LEADER GONE, NO ONE WAS

00:19:36.057 --> 00:19:37.325
REALLY CHECKING WHERE PEOPLE

00:19:37.325 --> 00:19:38.827
CAME FROM ANYMORE.

00:19:38.827 --> 00:19:40.095
SO NOBODY KNEW IF YOU WERE

00:19:40.095 --> 00:19:40.996
PREVIOUSLY PART OF THE OTHER

00:19:40.996 --> 00:19:42.563
GROUP.

00:19:42.563 --> 00:19:43.831
ALL SOMEONE HAD TO DO WAS REMOVE

00:19:43.831 --> 00:19:45.100
THEIR BLUE AND SAY THAT THEY

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.034
WANTED TO JOIN.

00:19:47.034 --> 00:19:49.570
THAT WAS IT.

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:51.105
&gt;&gt; AND SO THE GUY WHO QUIT,

00:19:51.105 --> 00:19:51.839
THE LEADER...

00:19:51.839 --> 00:19:53.107
&gt;&gt; I WOULD IMAGINE HE HAS NO

00:19:53.107 --> 00:19:54.008
IDEA THAT THE GUYS RESPONSIBLE

00:19:54.008 --> 00:19:55.109
FOR SENDING HIS OLD GIRLFRIEND

00:19:55.109 --> 00:19:56.743
TO THE HOSPITAL ARE NOW IN HIS

00:19:56.743 --> 00:19:59.579
OWN GANG.

00:19:59.579 --> 00:20:01.080
&gt;&gt; [gasps]

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.649
&gt;&gt; YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL, TOO.

00:20:02.649 --> 00:20:03.917
IT SEEMS THE DOLLARS HAVE A FEW

00:20:03.917 --> 00:20:05.018
YELLOW SCARVES AMONGST THEM AS

00:20:05.018 --> 00:20:06.920
WELL.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.021
&gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT THAT MIGHT WORK IN

00:20:08.021 --> 00:20:08.854
MY FAVOR.

00:20:08.854 --> 00:20:10.089
IF I SPREAD WORD THAT THE

00:20:10.089 --> 00:20:11.023
DOLLARS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH

00:20:11.023 --> 00:20:12.125
THE SLASHER, THEN THAT MIGHT GET

00:20:12.125 --> 00:20:15.127
PASSED ON TO THE YELLOW SCARVES.

00:20:15.127 --> 00:20:16.061
&gt;&gt; PROVIDING THE DOLLARS REALLY

00:20:16.061 --> 00:20:19.131
WEREN’T INVOLVED.

00:20:19.131 --> 00:20:20.432
THE DOLLARS DON’T HAVE ANY

00:20:20.432 --> 00:20:21.699
RULES, AND YOU DON’T KEEP ANY

00:20:21.699 --> 00:20:25.002
EYE ON EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.

00:20:25.002 --> 00:20:27.004
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT...

00:20:27.004 --> 00:20:28.072
SOME GUYS IN THE DOLLARS COULD

00:20:28.072 --> 00:20:29.373
BE WORKING WITH THE SLASHER

00:20:29.373 --> 00:20:32.910
WITHOUT YOU KNOWING.

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:34.011
AFTER ALL, THAT’S HOW THE

00:20:34.011 --> 00:20:35.679
DOLLARS WORK.

00:20:35.679 --> 00:20:36.780
IF YOU’RE GOING TO GET YOURSELF

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.615
INVOLVED IN THIS WORLD,

00:20:38.615 --> 00:20:39.883
YOU NEED TO BE PREPARED AND LOOK

00:20:39.883 --> 00:20:42.686
AT THE WHOLE PICTURE.

00:20:42.686 --> 00:20:46.722
&gt;&gt; I’LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.

00:20:53.128 --> 00:20:55.164
&gt;&gt; MORNING.

00:20:55.164 --> 00:20:57.099
MORNING!

00:20:57.099 --> 00:20:58.567
&gt;&gt; OH, HEY, GOOD MORNING.

00:20:58.567 --> 00:20:59.668
&gt;&gt; WHAT’S THE MATTER?

00:20:59.668 --> 00:21:00.702
YOU SEEM LIKE YOU’RE A LITTLE

00:21:00.702 --> 00:21:01.170
DOWN TODAY.

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:02.704
YOU SURE YOU’RE READY TO COME

00:21:02.704 --> 00:21:05.073
BACK TO SCHOOL?

00:21:05.073 --> 00:21:06.808
&gt;&gt; I’M FINE, REALLY.

00:21:06.808 --> 00:21:08.076
&gt;&gt; MORNIN’.

00:21:08.076 --> 00:21:08.843
&gt;&gt; MORNING.

00:21:08.843 --> 00:21:10.111
&gt;&gt; OH, HEY, I RAN INTO MASAOMI

00:21:10.111 --> 00:21:11.880
AT THE TRAIN STATION.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.181
SAID HE WASN’T COMIN’ TODAY.

00:21:13.181 --> 00:21:14.048
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:21:14.048 --> 00:21:14.782
HOW COME?

00:21:14.782 --> 00:21:16.049
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NO IDEA. HE DIDN’T

00:21:16.049 --> 00:21:17.885
REALLY GIVE ME A REASON WHY.

00:21:17.885 --> 00:21:18.819
&gt;&gt; OH, OKAY.

00:21:18.819 --> 00:21:20.053

00:21:20.053 --> 00:21:21.655
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THANKS, MAN.

00:21:21.655 --> 00:21:22.756
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN’T KEEP RUNNING FROM

00:21:22.756 --> 00:21:25.025
YOUR PAST, MASAOMI.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.563
HAS YOU WORRIED, RIGHT?

00:21:30.563 --> 00:21:31.664
SO STOP RUNNING.

00:21:31.664 --> 00:21:32.565
TURN AROUND, FIGHT THIS THING,

00:21:32.565 --> 00:21:34.133
AND WIN.

00:21:34.133 --> 00:21:36.102
&gt;&gt; I WISH IT WERE THAT SIMPLE.

00:21:36.102 --> 00:21:37.169
IF I COULD SETTLE OUR PAST JUST

00:21:37.169 --> 00:21:39.805
BY FIGHTING, THEN I’D GLADLY DO

00:21:39.805 --> 00:21:40.572
IT.

00:21:40.572 --> 00:21:43.074
&gt;&gt; WELL, WHY CAN’T YOU DO THAT?

00:21:43.074 --> 00:21:44.175

00:21:48.513 --> 00:21:50.115
HE BELONGED.

00:21:50.115 --> 00:21:51.582
EVERY TIME HE TALKED WITH HIS

00:21:51.582 --> 00:21:52.650
CHILDHOOD FRIEND ABOUT THIS NEW

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:53.918
CITY HE LIVED IN, HE REALIZED

00:21:53.918 --> 00:21:55.185
THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY JUST A

00:21:55.185 --> 00:21:59.690
STRANGER IN HIS OWN SKIN.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:01.158
THEN IT CAME TO HIM.

00:22:01.158 --> 00:22:02.492
THE ONLY PERSON AND PLACE THAT

00:22:02.492 --> 00:22:03.927

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.468
AND NOW HIS MOTIVATIONS WERE

00:22:12.468 --> 00:22:14.804
DRIVEN BY HIS DEAR FRIEND, THE

00:22:14.804 --> 00:22:17.073
HEART OF HIS NEW LIFE.

00:22:22.945 --> 00:22:24.046
