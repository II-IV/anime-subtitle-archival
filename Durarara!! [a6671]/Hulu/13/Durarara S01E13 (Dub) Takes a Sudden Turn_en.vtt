I WAS REALLY SCARED.

00:09:32.503 --> 00:09:34.071
I WAS TOO FULL OF MYSELF.

IF YOU FORGIVE ME, I PROMISE

00:09:35.372 --> 00:09:36.939

00:09:41.577 --> 00:09:43.579
IT’S NOT LIKE YOU TO PANIC OR

00:15:22.737 --> 00:15:24.773
AND SHE WAS FINE WITH THAT.

00:15:24.773 --> 00:15:26.608
SHE KNEW WHAT ROLE TO PLAY

00:15:26.608 --> 00:15:27.709
WITH HER.

00:15:27.709 --> 00:15:30.878
BUT NOW, AFTER LOSING THAT, SHE

00:15:30.878 --> 00:15:32.946
ISN’T EXACTLY SURE WHAT ROLE

00:15:32.946 --> 00:15:34.815
SHE SHOULD PLAY.

00:15:34.815 --> 00:15:36.383
&gt;&gt; OKAY!

00:15:36.383 --> 00:15:37.484
IN ORDER TO PROVE HOW

00:15:37.484 --> 00:15:39.286
BOOBIE-LICIOUS ANRI IS, LET’S

00:15:39.286 --> 00:15:41.253
GO HIT ON SOME HOTTIES.

00:15:41.253 --> 00:15:42.622
&gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU GET THAT?

00:15:42.622 --> 00:15:43.856
&gt;&gt; I HAVE TO HIT ON GIRLS?

00:15:43.856 --> 00:15:44.823
&gt;&gt; DON’T WORRY.

00:15:44.823 --> 00:15:46.358
I JUST WANNA USE YOU AS BAIT

00:15:46.358 --> 00:15:47.559
SO WHEN OTHER CHICKS SEE US,

00:15:47.559 --> 00:15:48.794
THEY THINK, "WELL IF THAT GIRL’S

00:15:48.794 --> 00:15:50.261
HANGING OUT WITH ’EM, I GUESS

00:15:50.261 --> 00:15:51.629
IT’S OKAY IF WE DO TOO."

00:15:51.629 --> 00:15:53.331
ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS STAND THERE.

00:15:53.331 --> 00:15:54.299
&gt;&gt; WAIT A SECOND, MASAOMI,

00:15:54.299 --> 00:15:54.899
YOU CAN’T--

00:15:54.899 --> 00:15:56.300
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, GLAD YOU’RE ALL

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.467
ON BOARD WITH THIS.

00:15:57.467 --> 00:15:58.903
ON YOUR MARK, GET SET, AND GO!

00:15:58.903 --> 00:15:59.803
HA HA!

00:15:59.803 --> 00:16:01.705
CATCH ME IF YOU CAN!

00:16:01.705 --> 00:16:02.939
&gt;&gt; DID HE JUST LEAVE?

00:16:02.939 --> 00:16:05.809
&gt;&gt; MASAOMI!

00:16:05.809 --> 00:16:06.709
[both sigh]

00:16:09.878 --> 00:16:11.747
&gt;&gt; IS IT OKAY WE DIDN’T GO

00:16:11.747 --> 00:16:12.514
WITH HIM?

00:16:12.514 --> 00:16:13.015
&gt;&gt; IT’S FINE.

00:16:13.015 --> 00:16:14.382
HE’S GONNA HIT ON GIRLS

00:16:14.382 --> 00:16:15.783
WHETHER WE’RE WITH HIM OR NOT.

00:16:15.783 --> 00:16:16.651
&gt;&gt; [giggles]

00:16:16.651 --> 00:16:17.919
&gt;&gt; OH, MAN.

00:16:17.919 --> 00:16:18.953
HMM?

00:16:18.953 --> 00:16:20.988
&gt;&gt; [giggles]

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:25.492
&gt;&gt; HE’S HOPELESS.

00:16:25.492 --> 00:16:26.927
HE’S SO BAD WITH GIRLS,

00:16:26.927 --> 00:16:28.728
HE NEEDS A SERIOUS HANDICAP.

00:16:28.728 --> 00:16:31.864
HE’S LUCKY I’M SUCH A PIMP.

00:16:38.703 --> 00:16:43.407
[overlapping chatter]

00:16:44.775 --> 00:16:46.410
&gt;&gt; ’SCUSE ME.

00:16:51.614 --> 00:16:53.650
&gt;&gt; SHE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.051
SHE REALIZED THAT BOTH THOSE

00:16:55.051 --> 00:16:56.819
BOYS WERE INTERESTED IN HER.

00:16:56.819 --> 00:16:59.588
BUT...

00:16:59.588 --> 00:17:01.890
&gt;&gt; HEY, THAT’S A PRETTY SUNSET.

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:02.758
&gt;&gt; [gasps]

00:17:02.758 --> 00:17:03.458
&gt;&gt; OH!

00:17:03.458 --> 00:17:04.725
BUT THAT CLOUD OVER THERE

00:17:04.725 --> 00:17:05.793
DOESN’T LOOK GOOD.

00:17:05.793 --> 00:17:07.462
MAYBE IT’S GONNA RAIN LATER.

00:17:07.462 --> 00:17:09.564
WE PROBABLY SHOULD BE CAREFUL.

00:17:09.564 --> 00:17:11.265
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:17.971
UM...

00:17:17.971 --> 00:17:19.572
&gt;&gt; UH, YEAH, WHAT IS IT?

00:17:19.572 --> 00:17:21.807
&gt;&gt; I SHOULD GO.

00:17:21.807 --> 00:17:22.875
GOOD-BYE.

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:24.677
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

00:17:24.677 --> 00:17:25.811
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:28.613
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

00:17:28.613 --> 00:17:30.848
[sighs]

00:17:30.848 --> 00:17:32.917
WHO SAYS "PRETTY SUNSET"?

00:17:32.917 --> 00:17:35.386
THAT WAS DUMB.

00:17:35.386 --> 00:17:37.020
&gt;&gt; IF EITHER OF THEM WERE TO ASK

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.789
HER ON A DATE, SHE WOULDN’T KNOW

00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:39.890
WHAT TO SAY.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:41.591
IT WAS CONFUSING FOR HER.

00:17:41.591 --> 00:17:43.759
SHE STILL LOVED MIKA HARIMA.

00:17:43.759 --> 00:17:45.327
AND HER FEELINGS FOR THOSE

00:17:45.327 --> 00:17:46.796
TWO BOYS WERE THE SAME.

00:17:46.796 --> 00:17:47.930
SHE STILL DOESN’T

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:48.797
UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE

00:17:48.797 --> 00:17:53.534
BETWEEN FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE.

00:17:53.534 --> 00:17:56.437
WHAT DO THEY MEAN TO HER?

00:17:56.437 --> 00:17:59.740
MIKA, MIKADO, MASAOMI.

00:18:02.575 --> 00:18:03.910
&gt;&gt; SO YOU’RE NOT GONNA CHANGE

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:04.777
YOUR MIND?

00:18:04.777 --> 00:18:05.778
&gt;&gt; C’MON, MAN, WE CAN’T DO

00:18:05.778 --> 00:18:06.913
ANYTHING WITHOUT YOU.

00:18:06.913 --> 00:18:08.915
&gt;&gt; I ALREADY TOLD YOU GUYS.

00:18:08.915 --> 00:18:10.816
THAT’S NOT WHO I AM ANYMORE.

00:18:10.816 --> 00:18:12.017
I WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH

00:18:12.017 --> 00:18:14.419
THAT NOW.

00:18:14.419 --> 00:18:16.621
I’M NOT COMIN’ BACK, OKAY?

00:18:16.621 --> 00:18:19.924
NOT TO THAT SIDE.

00:18:19.924 --> 00:18:23.894
&gt;&gt; SERIOUSLY?

00:18:24.894 --> 00:18:29.933
[siren]

00:18:58.090 --> 00:18:59.925
&gt;&gt; I SEE A LOT MORE PEOPLE

00:18:59.925 --> 00:19:00.792
AROUND THE CITY ARE

00:19:00.792 --> 00:19:01.993
WEARING YELLOW NOW.

00:19:01.993 --> 00:19:02.827
&gt;&gt; YELLOW?

00:19:02.827 --> 00:19:03.762
&gt;&gt; I KNOW.

00:19:03.762 --> 00:19:04.829
YOU NOTICE THEM MORE BECAUSE OF

00:19:04.829 --> 00:19:07.631
THEIR COLOR, UNLIKE THE DOLLARS.

00:19:07.631 --> 00:19:09.467
&gt;&gt; OH, THE YELLOW SCARVES,

00:19:09.467 --> 00:19:09.933
RIGHT?

00:19:09.933 --> 00:19:11.702
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THESE GUYS, SETTON?

00:19:11.702 --> 00:19:13.070
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I GUESS SO.

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:14.637
I MEAN, THEY’VE BEEN AROUND

00:19:14.637 --> 00:19:15.772
A LONG TIME.

00:19:15.772 --> 00:19:17.774
&gt;&gt; WHAT’S THE YELLOW SCARVES?

00:19:17.774 --> 00:19:18.975
&gt;&gt; THEY WERE THIS GANG FROM

00:19:18.975 --> 00:19:20.176
IKEBUKURO.

00:19:20.176 --> 00:19:21.577
THEN THEY GOT IN A HUGE FIGHT

00:19:21.577 --> 00:19:22.511
WITH ANOTHER GANG AND KINDA

00:19:22.511 --> 00:19:24.045
FELL OFF THE MAP.

00:19:24.045 --> 00:19:26.181
&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH, I HAVE HEARD ABOUT

00:19:26.181 --> 00:19:28.416
THESE GUYS.

00:19:28.416 --> 00:19:29.617
&gt;&gt; SO DOES THAT MEAN

00:19:29.617 --> 00:19:30.585
THEY’RE BACK?

00:19:30.585 --> 00:19:31.852
&gt;&gt; IKEBUKURO’S GETTIN’ KINDA

00:19:31.852 --> 00:19:32.920
SKETCHY LATELY.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:33.988
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:19:33.988 --> 00:19:36.090
EVEN THE POLICE ARE SCARY THERE.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:37.591
I MEAN IT.

00:19:37.591 --> 00:19:38.992
DON’T MESS WITH THE COPS,

00:19:38.992 --> 00:19:40.159
ALL RIGHT?

00:19:40.159 --> 00:19:41.895
&gt;&gt; THE COPS?

00:19:41.895 --> 00:19:43.830
&gt;&gt; [groans]

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.964
&gt;&gt; AH, LOOK, SHE FELL DOWN.

00:19:45.964 --> 00:19:46.832
LOSER.

00:19:46.832 --> 00:19:47.900
&gt;&gt; WE ONLY KICKED YOU A LITTLE

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:48.667
BIT.

00:19:48.667 --> 00:19:49.935
DON’T BE SO CLUMSY.

00:19:49.935 --> 00:19:51.769
&gt;&gt; YOU’RE A LITTLE PARASITE.

00:19:51.769 --> 00:19:53.538
[laughter]

00:19:53.538 --> 00:19:54.806
&gt;&gt; DON’T YOU BE GIVIN’ ME

00:19:54.806 --> 00:19:56.007
THAT STINK-EYE.

00:19:56.007 --> 00:19:57.074
&gt;&gt; IT’LL BE A WHILE BEFORE THEY

00:19:57.074 --> 00:19:59.176
SOLVE THAT SLASHER CASE.

00:19:59.176 --> 00:20:01.011
&gt;&gt; HEY, DID YOU GUYS HEAR?

00:20:01.011 --> 00:20:02.613
EVERYBODY SAYIN’ THAT THE

00:20:02.613 --> 00:20:03.747
DOLLARS ARE ACTUALLY THE

00:20:03.747 --> 00:20:04.647
SLASHER.

00:20:04.647 --> 00:20:05.748
SOME SAY THEY’RE THE BLACK

00:20:05.748 --> 00:20:06.816
RIDER, TOO.

00:20:06.816 --> 00:20:08.584
&gt;&gt; HUH? WHO SAID THAT?

00:20:08.584 --> 00:20:10.219
&gt;&gt; I DON’T THINK THAT’S TRUE.

00:20:10.219 --> 00:20:12.487
&gt;&gt; ALL JOKING ASIDE, YOU

00:20:12.487 --> 00:20:13.955
SHOULD REALLY WATCH OUT FOR THE

00:20:13.955 --> 00:20:15.457
YELLOW SCARVES.

00:20:15.457 --> 00:20:16.958
SOME OF THOSE GUYS REALLY DON’T

00:20:16.958 --> 00:20:18.159
LIKE THE DOLLARS.

00:20:18.159 --> 00:20:19.828
THEY’RE KINDA PISSED ABOUT HOW

00:20:19.828 --> 00:20:20.728
BIG THEY’VE GOTTEN WHILE

00:20:20.728 --> 00:20:21.962
THEY’VE LAID LOW.

00:20:21.962 --> 00:20:23.797
&gt;&gt; REALLY?

00:20:23.797 --> 00:20:26.566
OKAY, I’LL BE CAREFUL.

00:20:26.566 --> 00:20:28.701
&gt;&gt; [grunts]

00:20:28.701 --> 00:20:30.770
[groans]

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:31.971
&gt;&gt; LOOK AT YOU.

00:20:31.971 --> 00:20:33.472
MIKA’S GONE, SO YOU’RE SLUTTIN’

00:20:33.472 --> 00:20:35.574
AROUND WITH MIKADO AND MASAOMI.

00:20:35.574 --> 00:20:36.975
AND NOW NASUJIMA?

00:20:36.975 --> 00:20:38.076
&gt;&gt; HOW MANY GUYS YOU GONNA WHORE

00:20:38.076 --> 00:20:39.511
YOURSELF OUT TO?

00:20:39.511 --> 00:20:41.046
GOD, YOU’RE A SKANK.

00:20:41.046 --> 00:20:42.580
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, YOU SUCK THE LIFE

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.582
OUT OF EVERYTHING AROUND YOU.

00:20:44.582 --> 00:20:45.483
&gt;&gt; PARASITE.

00:20:45.483 --> 00:20:45.983
&gt;&gt; PARASITE.

00:20:45.983 --> 00:20:47.051
&gt;&gt; PARASITE.

00:20:47.051 --> 00:20:48.018
&gt;&gt; all: PARASITE.

00:20:48.018 --> 00:20:49.219
&gt;&gt; THE GIRL REALIZED THAT

00:20:49.219 --> 00:20:50.520
WHAT THEY WERE SAYING ABOUT

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.855
HER WASN’T TOO FAR FROM THE

00:20:51.855 --> 00:20:52.789
TRUTH.

00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:54.257
SHE WAS DEPENDENT ON MIKA

00:20:54.257 --> 00:20:55.191
HARIMA.

00:20:55.191 --> 00:20:56.926
AND NOW, THINGS WEREN’T

00:20:56.926 --> 00:20:58.061
MUCH DIFFERENT.

00:20:58.061 --> 00:20:59.595
&gt;&gt; SAY SOMETHING, SLUT.

00:20:59.595 --> 00:21:01.096
&gt;&gt; TOO DUMB TO TALK?

00:21:01.096 --> 00:21:02.530
&gt;&gt; DO PARASITES EVEN HAVE A

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:03.131
MOUTH?

00:21:03.131 --> 00:21:04.199
&gt;&gt; OH, LOOK.

00:21:04.199 --> 00:21:05.133
&gt;&gt; SHE’D LET HERSELF BECOME

00:21:05.133 --> 00:21:06.901
DEPENDENT ON THOSE TWO BOYS AS

00:21:06.901 --> 00:21:09.103
WELL, AND NOW SHE’S TRYING TO

00:21:09.103 --> 00:21:10.972
FIND HER PLACE WITH THEM.

00:21:10.972 --> 00:21:12.106
&gt;&gt; YOU STINK UP THE WHOLE

00:21:12.106 --> 00:21:13.707
SCHOOL, YOU PARASITE.

00:21:13.707 --> 00:21:14.775
JUST STAY HOME.

00:21:14.775 --> 00:21:15.976
&gt;&gt; LISTEN, SLUTBAG, TWO OF MY

00:21:15.976 --> 00:21:16.943
BOYFRIENDS WERE BEATEN UP

00:21:16.943 --> 00:21:17.944
BECAUSE OF YOU.

00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:18.778
&gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU LIVE WITH

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:19.979
YOURSELF, HUH?

00:21:19.979 --> 00:21:21.146
&gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT SHE DID TO

00:21:21.146 --> 00:21:23.649
PROTECT HERSELF AND HER HEART.

00:21:23.649 --> 00:21:25.150
NOTHING NEW HAPPENS,

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:26.985
NOTHING CHANGES.

00:21:26.985 --> 00:21:28.987
THIS WAS HER DAILY LIFE.

00:21:28.987 --> 00:21:30.054
&gt;&gt; YOU LIVE AROUND HERE,

00:21:30.054 --> 00:21:31.022
DON’T YOU?

00:21:31.022 --> 00:21:32.656
MAYBE WE SHOULD SWING BY.

00:21:32.656 --> 00:21:33.691
&gt;&gt; YEAH, WE’LL SEE WHAT YOU’RE

00:21:33.691 --> 00:21:34.658
HIDING IN THERE.

00:21:34.658 --> 00:21:35.293
&gt;&gt; GET US SOME HARD PROOF

00:21:35.293 --> 00:21:36.894
THAT YOU’RE A SKANK.

00:21:38.896 --> 00:21:46.936
[no audio]

00:21:56.111 --> 00:21:58.145
&gt;&gt; IT’S HERE!

00:21:58.145 --> 00:21:59.113
&gt;&gt; OH!

00:21:59.113 --> 00:22:01.048
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:22:01.048 --> 00:22:02.316
&gt;&gt; I’M THE ONE WHO WANTS TO
