&gt;&gt; CRAP! THE BLACK RIDER!

00:08:49.445 --> 00:08:50.146

00:08:50.146 --> 00:08:52.247
[screaming]

00:09:01.087 --> 00:09:02.721
&gt;&gt; YOU BOYS HAVE GUTS BLOWIN’ BY

00:09:02.721 --> 00:09:06.158
A TRAFFIC COP LIKE THAT.

00:09:06.158 --> 00:09:07.759
JACKIN’ WITH THE COPS IS A BAD

00:09:07.759 --> 00:09:09.393
IDEA, PUNK WADS.

00:09:09.393 --> 00:09:11.762
&gt;&gt; [screams]

00:09:11.762 --> 00:09:17.032
[sirens wail]

00:09:17.032 --> 00:09:18.267
&gt;&gt; HORADA AND HIS GANG WERE

00:09:18.267 --> 00:09:19.801
ARRESTED.

00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:20.434
THEY TRIED TO GET

00:09:20.434 --> 00:09:22.303
SHIZUO HEIWAJIMA BUSTED FOR

00:09:22.303 --> 00:09:23.336
DESTROYING THEIR CAR, BUT

00:09:23.336 --> 00:09:25.405
APPARENTLY THE POLICE WEREN’T

00:09:25.405 --> 00:09:26.939
INTERESTED IN THAT.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:37.381
&gt;&gt; TAKE CARE NOW.

00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:38.381
&gt;&gt; THANKS FOR EVERYTHING YOU’VE

00:09:38.381 --> 00:09:40.049
DONE.

00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:53.759
HEY, WHERE’S ANRI?

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:00.431
&gt;&gt; YEP. THIS IS IT.

00:10:00.431 --> 00:10:01.965
EXCELLENT WORK.

00:10:01.965 --> 00:10:03.033
NOW I CAN COLLECT THE REWARD

00:10:03.033 --> 00:10:06.068
THE AWAKUSU GROUP PUT OUT.

00:10:06.068 --> 00:10:06.835
&gt;&gt; GREAT.

00:10:06.835 --> 00:10:08.069
I TRIED TO GET THE BULLETS BACK

00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:09.337
FOR YA, BUT I COULDN’T.

00:10:09.337 --> 00:10:10.205
&gt;&gt; OH, DON’T WORRY.

00:10:10.205 --> 00:10:11.071
THAT’S FINE.

00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:13.173
YOU KNOW, IF HE’D BEEN ABLE TO

00:10:13.173 --> 00:10:14.774
KILL SHIZU-CHAN WITH THIS THING,

00:10:14.774 --> 00:10:16.309
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT.

00:10:16.309 --> 00:10:17.143
&gt;&gt; TELL ME.

00:10:17.143 --> 00:10:18.077
THAT’S WHY YOU GAVE ME THAT

00:10:18.077 --> 00:10:19.011
INFO, RIGHT?

00:10:19.011 --> 00:10:20.112
SO I WOULD PASS IT ON TO

00:10:20.112 --> 00:10:21.746
HORADA FOR YOU.

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:22.780
&gt;&gt; IF ONLY HE’D HIT HIM IN HIS

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:23.981
HEAD OR HIS HEART, THEN HE

00:10:23.981 --> 00:10:25.782
MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY DIED.

00:10:25.782 --> 00:10:27.183
IT’S A SHAME REALLY.

00:10:27.183 --> 00:10:29.085
&gt;&gt; SO THERE YOU HAVE IT, MOTHER.

00:10:29.085 --> 00:10:30.486
THE TRUTH.

00:10:30.486 --> 00:10:35.223
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:10:35.223 --> 00:10:35.990
&gt;&gt; GREAT.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.359
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

00:10:38.359 --> 00:10:39.760
NOW I WANT YOU TO GO HOME AND

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.094
LIVE A NORMAL LIFE.

00:10:50.467 --> 00:10:54.137
SO YOU MUST BE IZAYA ORIHARA.

00:10:54.137 --> 00:10:56.105
&gt;&gt; WELL, IT’S ANRI SONOHARA.

00:10:56.105 --> 00:10:57.940
OR PERHAPS I SHOULD CALL YOU

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.007
SAIKA INSTEAD.

00:11:00.007 --> 00:11:03.944
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT SO LATE?

00:11:03.944 --> 00:11:05.979
I’M HERE BECAUSE I’M GONNA CUT

00:11:05.979 --> 00:11:06.812
YOU.

00:11:06.812 --> 00:11:08.080
&gt;&gt; OH?

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.082
&gt;&gt; TELL ME, WHAT WAS YOUR

00:11:10.082 --> 00:11:11.816
REASON FOR DOING THIS?

00:11:11.816 --> 00:11:13.384
&gt;&gt; WHAT? COME ON.

00:11:13.384 --> 00:11:15.519
I DIDN’T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:17.921
HOWEVER, IF I HAD TO GIVE YOU

00:11:17.921 --> 00:11:19.121
A REASON, I GUESS IT WOULD BE

00:11:19.121 --> 00:11:22.124
BECAUSE I LOVE HUMANS.

00:11:22.124 --> 00:11:23.992
ALL OF THEM.

00:11:23.992 --> 00:11:25.126
AND BECAUSE I LOVE THEM SO

00:11:25.126 --> 00:11:26.427
MUCH, I LIKE TO SEE THEM IN ALL

00:11:26.427 --> 00:11:28.428
KINDS OF CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:11:28.428 --> 00:11:30.264
HERE’S A QUESTION FOR YA:

00:11:30.264 --> 00:11:31.431
AM I TELLING YOU THE TRUTH

00:11:31.431 --> 00:11:37.002
RIGHT NOW, OR IS IT A LIE?

00:11:37.002 --> 00:11:39.103
&gt;&gt; ONCE I CUT YOU, I’LL CONTROL

00:11:39.103 --> 00:11:40.571
YOU AND KNOW IF YOU’RE LYING.

00:11:40.571 --> 00:11:41.872
&gt;&gt; ENOUGH ABOUT ME.

00:11:41.872 --> 00:11:42.906
LET’S TALK ABOUT YOU.

00:11:42.906 --> 00:11:44.040
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HAVE A

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.941
PEACEFUL LIFE, WHY DON’T YOU

00:11:45.941 --> 00:11:47.176
USE THAT SWORD TO CUT EVERYONE

00:11:47.176 --> 00:11:48.343
YOU KNOW AND KEEP THINGS QUIET

00:11:48.343 --> 00:11:50.344
AROUND HERE.

00:11:50.344 --> 00:11:51.880
&gt;&gt; I WON’T DO THAT.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.847
THAT’S WRONG, AND YOU KNOW IT.

00:11:53.847 --> 00:11:55.048
&gt;&gt; IS IT NOW?

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:56.316
AND HOW YOU TREATED MIKADO AND

00:11:56.316 --> 00:11:57.517
MASAOMI?

00:11:57.517 --> 00:11:59.085
YOU KNEW HOW THEY BOTH FELT

00:11:59.085 --> 00:12:00.052
ABOUT YOU.

00:12:00.052 --> 00:12:02.053
YET YOU KEPT QUIET AND LED BOTH

00:12:02.053 --> 00:12:03.854
OF THOSE BOYS ON.

00:12:03.854 --> 00:12:05.155
YOU THINK THAT WAS THE RIGHT

00:12:05.155 --> 00:12:07.457
THING TO DO?

00:12:07.457 --> 00:12:09.225
YOU’VE CONVINCED YOURSELF THAT

00:12:09.225 --> 00:12:10.860
YOU CAN NEVER LOVE ANYONE, AND

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.328
NOW YOU’RE USING THAT EXCUSE TO

00:12:12.328 --> 00:12:14.196
STAND BY AND DO NOTHING.

00:12:14.196 --> 00:12:15.597
I KNOW THAT YOU THINK SAIKA’S

00:12:15.597 --> 00:12:18.132
GOING TO LOVE PEOPLE FOR YOU.

00:12:18.132 --> 00:12:19.200
BUT THAT’S STUPID.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.367
&gt;&gt; YOU’VE SAID ENOUGH!

00:12:27.572 --> 00:12:29.841
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU DONE?

00:12:29.841 --> 00:12:30.874
YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY SHOULDN’T

00:12:30.874 --> 00:12:32.442
UNDERESTIMATE ME.

00:12:32.442 --> 00:12:34.144
AFTER ALL, THERE IS A VERY GOOD

00:12:34.144 --> 00:12:35.512
REASON WHY I CAN GO TOE-TO-TOE

00:12:35.512 --> 00:12:37.179
WITH SHIZU-CHAN.

00:12:37.179 --> 00:12:39.114
IN ADDITION, YOUR BIGGEST

00:12:39.114 --> 00:12:41.049
MISTAKE WAS NOT TAKING THIS

00:12:41.049 --> 00:12:44.018
FROM ME WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE.

00:12:44.018 --> 00:12:45.119
[laughs] IT’S ALL RIGHT.

00:12:45.119 --> 00:12:46.019
DON’T WORRY.

00:12:46.019 --> 00:12:47.153
I WON’T SHOOT YOU.

00:12:47.153 --> 00:12:49.888
BUT WHO WILL IT BE INSTEAD?

00:12:49.888 --> 00:12:50.589
&gt;&gt; IT’S ALWAYS SO QUIET...

00:12:50.589 --> 00:12:51.456
&gt;&gt; THAT COUPLE LOOKS LIKE AN

00:12:51.456 --> 00:12:52.424
EXCELLENT CHOICE.

00:12:52.424 --> 00:12:53.258
&gt;&gt; [gasps]

00:12:53.258 --> 00:12:54.592
&gt;&gt; THIS WON’T BOTHER YOU AT ALL,

00:12:54.592 --> 00:12:55.960
SEEING HOW YOU CAN’T LOVE

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.161
ANYONE.

00:12:57.161 --> 00:12:58.595
YOU DIDN’T FOOL ME.

00:12:58.595 --> 00:13:00.196
I KNEW ALL ALONG THAT HIGA WAS

00:13:00.196 --> 00:13:02.264
ONE OF THE SLASHER VICTIMS.

00:13:02.264 --> 00:13:03.265
IT’S TRUE.

00:13:03.265 --> 00:13:04.166
AFTER ALL, WHY DO YOU THINK I

00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:06.500
ASKED HIM TO GET ME THIS GUN?

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.102
I DID IT FOR YOU.

00:13:08.102 --> 00:13:09.270
’CAUSE I WANTED TO DECLARE WAR

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.171
ON YOU.

00:13:11.171 --> 00:13:13.940
SEE, I TOO DEEPLY LOVE PEOPLE.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.107
AND I WILL NOT LET THEM BE

00:13:15.107 --> 00:13:17.175
TAKEN BY A STUPID SWORD.

00:13:17.175 --> 00:13:19.877
HUMANS ARE MINE, AND I REALLY

00:13:19.877 --> 00:13:22.512
DON’T LIKE TO SHARE.

00:13:22.512 --> 00:13:24.113
OH, BUT THAT SAID, I DON’T

00:13:24.113 --> 00:13:25.314
NEED SHIZU-CHAN.

00:13:25.314 --> 00:13:26.382
HE’S ALL YOURS.

00:13:26.382 --> 00:13:28.116
I HOPE YOU SLICE HIM TO PIECES

00:13:28.116 --> 00:13:29.251
IMMEDIATELY.

00:13:29.251 --> 00:13:31.353
I MEAN, WHY WAIT?

00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:32.353
BEST OF LUCK!

00:13:32.353 --> 00:13:35.489
SEE YA!

00:13:44.362 --> 00:13:46.330
&gt;&gt; YOU’RE BACK LATE.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.131
LOOK AT YOUR FACE!

00:13:48.131 --> 00:13:50.633
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:13:50.633 --> 00:13:52.001
&gt;&gt; I WAS HIT WITH A RATHER

00:13:52.001 --> 00:13:53.202
HARD PUNCH.

00:13:53.202 --> 00:13:55.203
[hums]

00:13:55.203 --> 00:13:56.304
&gt;&gt; HEY.

00:13:56.304 --> 00:13:58.606
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:13:58.606 --> 00:14:00.007
SIMON?

00:14:00.007 --> 00:14:01.441
&gt;&gt; HMM.

00:14:01.441 --> 00:14:05.378
&gt;&gt; [shouts, grunts]

00:14:10.147 --> 00:14:12.183
&gt;&gt; [speaking Russian]

00:14:15.185 --> 00:14:17.186
[laughs]

00:14:17.186 --> 00:14:19.221
&gt;&gt; [speaking Russian]

00:15:04.988 --> 00:15:06.122
[laughs]

00:15:14.261 --> 00:15:16.530
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU’RE SPEAKING

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:17.731
IN RUSSIAN, YOU ARE SO NOT THE

00:15:17.731 --> 00:15:19.165
SAME GUY.

00:15:19.165 --> 00:15:22.367
OH, HEY, I’VE GOT A QUESTION.

00:15:22.367 --> 00:15:23.401
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

00:15:23.401 --> 00:15:24.969
&gt;&gt; IT SEEMS THAT SOMEONE TOLD

00:15:24.969 --> 00:15:26.337
HORADA ABOUT MIKADO.

00:15:26.337 --> 00:15:28.039
WAS IT YOU?

00:15:28.039 --> 00:15:29.172
&gt;&gt; DON’T KNOW, MAYBE.

00:15:29.172 --> 00:15:31.241
&gt;&gt; OOH, SCARY.

00:15:31.241 --> 00:15:33.342
SO, YOU’RE STILL UPSET.

00:15:33.342 --> 00:15:35.244
HONESTLY, SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST

00:15:35.244 --> 00:15:37.311
SO INCREDIBLY PREDICTABLE.

00:15:37.311 --> 00:15:38.312
AND THEN THERE’S SIMON AND

00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:40.180
SHIZU-CHAN, WHO NEVER DO WHAT

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.481
YOU EXPECT.

00:15:41.481 --> 00:15:43.150
AND THAT RIGHT THERE IS EXACTLY

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.017
WHY I LOVE THE HUMAN RACE SO

00:15:45.017 --> 00:15:45.985
MUCH.

00:15:45.985 --> 00:15:47.319
THERE YOU HAVE IT.

00:15:47.319 --> 00:15:48.987
IT’S ALSO THE VERY REASON WHY

00:15:48.987 --> 00:15:50.188
I CAN KEEP DOING THIS FREAKIN’

00:15:50.188 --> 00:15:51.989
JOB FOREVER.

00:15:51.989 --> 00:15:53.690
IT’S SO FUN, IT MAKES ME WANT

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:54.658
TO PUKE.

00:15:54.658 --> 00:15:55.592
&gt;&gt; I KNOW I’VE SAID THIS

00:15:55.592 --> 00:15:57.593
BEFORE, BUT I THINK THAT THE

00:15:57.593 --> 00:15:59.161
ENTIRE HUMAN RACE PRETTY MUCH

00:15:59.161 --> 00:16:00.663
HATES YOUR GUTS.

00:16:00.663 --> 00:16:02.597
&gt;&gt; MAYBE YOU’RE RIGHT.

00:16:02.597 --> 00:16:06.600
[laughing]

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:11.704
&gt;&gt; SAKI.

00:16:11.704 --> 00:16:13.238
&gt;&gt; I KNEW IT.

00:16:13.238 --> 00:16:15.139
TRUTH IS, YOU NEVER EVEN

00:16:15.139 --> 00:16:17.075
SHOWED UP THAT DAY.

00:16:17.075 --> 00:16:17.608
&gt;&gt; OH!

00:16:17.608 --> 00:16:19.142
&gt;&gt; INSTEAD, YOU SPENT THE WHOLE

00:16:19.142 --> 00:16:20.310
TIME TRYING TO GET A HOLD OF

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:21.744
IZAYA.

00:16:21.744 --> 00:16:24.113
YOU CALLED HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN.

00:16:24.113 --> 00:16:25.414
WHEN I SAW HIM, HE SHOWED ME

00:16:25.414 --> 00:16:27.148
HIS CALL HISTORY AND HE JUST

00:16:27.148 --> 00:16:27.615
LAUGHED.

00:16:27.615 --> 00:16:28.516
&gt;&gt; [sighs]

00:16:28.516 --> 00:16:29.750
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU SHOULDN’T WORRY ABOUT

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:30.585
IT.

00:16:30.585 --> 00:16:32.252
EVEN IF YOU GOT THERE LATE...

00:16:32.252 --> 00:16:33.553
IT REALLY WOULDN’T HAVE MADE A

00:16:33.553 --> 00:16:34.688
BIG DIFFERENCE TO ME.

00:16:34.688 --> 00:16:35.754
&gt;&gt; DON’T SAY THAT.

00:16:35.754 --> 00:16:36.555
&gt;&gt; IT’S TRUE.

00:16:36.555 --> 00:16:37.523
IN FACT I THINK IT’S FOR THE

00:16:37.523 --> 00:16:38.423
BEST.

00:16:38.423 --> 00:16:39.591

00:16:43.194 --> 00:16:44.195
END THIS THING.

00:16:46.262 --> 00:16:48.598
[gasps]

00:16:48.598 --> 00:16:51.366
I AM SUCH A LOSER.

00:16:51.366 --> 00:16:53.702
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY SAKI WANTED

00:16:53.702 --> 00:16:54.702

00:16:54.702 --> 00:16:55.469

00:16:56.604 --> 00:16:58.471
HONEST LIKE THAT.

00:17:00.306 --> 00:17:01.240

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.541
ERIKA AND THE OTHERS TOLD ME

00:17:02.541 --> 00:17:03.609
WHAT HAPPENED.

00:17:03.609 --> 00:17:04.776
ALL OF IT.

00:17:04.776 --> 00:17:06.244
GUESS WHAT?

00:17:06.244 --> 00:17:08.078
YOU’RE A REALLY BIG IDIOT, YOU

00:17:08.078 --> 00:17:09.246

00:17:09.246 --> 00:17:10.280
&gt;&gt; YOU’RE JUST NOW NOTICING

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.247

00:17:11.247 --> 00:17:13.549
&gt;&gt; LOOK, I NEED TO APOLOGIZE TO

00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:14.583

00:17:14.583 --> 00:17:15.484
&gt;&gt; WHA?

00:17:15.484 --> 00:17:17.319
&gt;&gt; THEY REALLY DIDN’T KIDNAP ME.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:19.353
I KINDA LET THEM CATCH ME.

00:17:19.353 --> 00:17:21.222
IZAYA TOLD ME IF I DID THAT,

00:17:21.222 --> 00:17:24.157
THEN EVERYTHING WOULD END.

00:17:24.157 --> 00:17:25.358
SO THAT’S WHAT I DID.

00:17:25.358 --> 00:17:28.060
THAT NIGHT, I WENT THERE ALONE

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.262
ON MY OWN FREE WILL.

00:17:31.262 --> 00:17:33.631
AND THEN IZAYA TOLD THEM WHERE

00:17:33.631 --> 00:17:35.232

00:17:35.232 --> 00:17:35.698
&gt;&gt; I KNEW.

00:17:35.698 --> 00:17:36.366

00:17:42.738 --> 00:17:44.539
HE PLAYED ME LIKE A PAWN THE

00:17:44.539 --> 00:17:46.306
WHOLE TIME.

00:17:46.306 --> 00:17:47.274

&gt;&gt; I’M NOW ABLE TO SAY THIS...

00:17:57.114 --> 00:17:58.782
I COULDN’T SAVE YOU.

00:17:58.782 --> 00:17:59.516
I’M SORRY.

00:17:59.516 --> 00:18:00.651
&gt;&gt; OH.

00:18:00.651 --> 00:18:02.352
&gt;&gt; BUT STILL THAT DOESN’T

00:18:02.352 --> 00:18:04.354
MEAN THAT I DON’T LOVE YOU.

00:18:04.354 --> 00:18:05.587
BECAUSE I DO.

00:18:05.587 --> 00:18:07.648
SO DON’T LEAVE ME.

00:18:11.592 --> 00:18:13.293
HEY!

00:18:13.293 --> 00:18:15.395
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE SUCH AN IDIOT.

00:18:15.395 --> 00:18:17.096
IT’S UNBELIEVABLE.

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:18.397
&gt;&gt; OKAY, YOU’VE MENTIONED THAT.

00:18:18.397 --> 00:18:19.665
BUT CAN’T YOU AT LEAST LET ME

00:18:21.499 --> 00:18:22.733
&gt;&gt; IF YOU REALIZE IT’S A FLAW,

00:18:22.733 --> 00:18:25.335
FIX IT.

00:18:25.335 --> 00:18:27.236
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:18:27.236 --> 00:18:31.273
WE’LL FIX IT TOGETHER.

00:18:31.273 --> 00:18:33.175
&gt;&gt; SEVERAL DAYS LATER, MASAOMI

00:18:33.175 --> 00:18:34.876
AND SAKI MIKAJIMA DISAPPEARED

00:18:34.876 --> 00:18:38.111
TOGETHER.

00:18:38.111 --> 00:18:39.312
HE TURNED IN A LETTER TO THE

00:18:39.312 --> 00:18:40.246
SCHOOL SAYING HE WAS LEAVING,

00:18:40.246 --> 00:18:44.583
AND THEN HE VANISHED.

00:18:44.583 --> 00:18:45.684
THE NORMAL EVERYDAY LIFE THE

00:18:45.684 --> 00:18:48.419
THREE OF US HAD WAS GONE.

00:18:48.419 --> 00:18:50.520
BUT THE CITY, IT STAYED THE

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.654
SAME.

00:18:51.654 --> 00:18:53.290
&gt;&gt; RUSSIA SUSHI GOOD!

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:53.823

&gt;&gt; AND UP.

00:18:54.857 --> 00:18:56.692
&gt;&gt; AND THEM...

00:18:56.692 --> 00:18:57.693
AND THEM...

00:18:57.693 --> 00:18:59.327
&gt;&gt; [growls]

00:18:59.327 --> 00:19:01.361
&gt;&gt; AND HIM...

00:19:01.361 --> 00:19:02.296
[crash]

00:19:02.296 --> 00:19:03.830
AND HIM.

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:05.231
&gt;&gt; IT’S SO PEACEFUL.

00:19:05.231 --> 00:19:05.765
&gt;&gt; MM.

00:19:05.765 --> 00:19:07.166
SEEMS LIKE THOSE WHO ARE STILL

00:19:07.166 --> 00:19:08.367
LEFT IN THE BLUE SQUARES ARE

00:19:08.367 --> 00:19:09.735
HAVING ALL KINDS OF INTERNAL

00:19:09.735 --> 00:19:10.868
PROBLEMS.

00:19:10.868 --> 00:19:11.769
AND IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYONE IN

00:19:11.769 --> 00:19:13.204
THE YELLOW SCARVES HAS CALMED

00:19:13.204 --> 00:19:13.838
DOWN.

00:19:13.838 --> 00:19:15.172
&gt;&gt; THAT’S GOOD.

00:19:15.172 --> 00:19:16.640
THAT MEANS ANRI AND MIKADO NO

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.540
LONGER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:22.344
BEING ATTACKED.

00:19:22.344 --> 00:19:23.412
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:23.912

00:19:25.146 --> 00:19:25.914

00:19:25.914 --> 00:19:27.214
IF YOU’RE SEDUCING ME, THEN I

00:19:27.214 --> 00:19:28.415
GOTTA START GETTING READY.

00:19:28.415 --> 00:19:29.382
I NEED TO TAKE A SHOWER AND PUT

00:19:29.382 --> 00:19:31.317
ON SOME CLEAN SHEETS.

00:19:31.317 --> 00:19:33.552
HUH?

00:19:33.552 --> 00:19:34.686
&gt;&gt; WHAT’S WRONG?

00:19:34.686 --> 00:19:35.487
&gt;&gt; NOTHING.

00:19:35.487 --> 00:19:36.554
IT’S JUST THAT NORMALLY YOU’D

00:19:36.554 --> 00:19:37.822
BE JABBING ME IN THE RIBS BY

00:19:37.822 --> 00:19:39.757
NOW OR YANKING MY CHEEK OUT

00:19:39.757 --> 00:19:42.426
LIKE THIS.

00:19:42.426 --> 00:19:46.462
&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY, I AM SEDUCING YOU.

00:19:46.462 --> 00:19:47.429
&gt;&gt; [EXCLAIMS]

00:19:47.429 --> 00:19:49.564
&gt;&gt; SAME WITH THEM.

00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:50.932
WILL THE NORMAL EVERYDAY LIFE

00:19:50.932 --> 00:19:52.833
THAT WE ONCE KNEW EVER COME

00:19:52.833 --> 00:19:53.767
BACK?

00:19:53.767 --> 00:19:55.869
&gt;&gt; I WONDER IF I HAD FEELINGS

00:19:55.869 --> 00:19:58.337
FOR MASAOMI.

00:19:58.337 --> 00:19:59.571
AND THAT’S WHY I FEEL SO

00:19:59.571 --> 00:20:01.205
LONELY.

00:20:01.205 --> 00:20:03.441
I JUST REALLY DON’T KNOW.

00:20:03.441 --> 00:20:06.710
IT’S STUFF LIKE THIS I’M KIND

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.378
OF BAD AT.

00:20:08.378 --> 00:20:10.246
&gt;&gt; BUT I DID LEARN SOMETHING.

00:20:10.246 --> 00:20:12.314
THE DOLLARS ARE THE CITY.

00:20:12.314 --> 00:20:13.849
A LOT OF PEOPLE COME HERE AND

00:20:13.849 --> 00:20:15.616
LEAVE AND ARE NEVER SWAYED BY

00:20:15.616 --> 00:20:16.617
ANY COLOR.

00:20:16.617 --> 00:20:19.519
SOMETHING IS ALWAYS HAPPENING.

00:20:19.519 --> 00:20:20.787
PEOPLE ARE EITHER LOVING EACH

00:20:20.787 --> 00:20:22.188
OTHER OR HATING EACH OTHER,

00:20:22.188 --> 00:20:24.490
BECOMING FRIENDS OR DRIFTING

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:25.523
APART.

00:20:25.523 --> 00:20:29.326
[typing]

00:20:29.326 --> 00:20:30.394
SO JUST LIKE THE CITY WILL

00:20:30.394 --> 00:20:31.728
EXIST AS LONG AS THERE ARE

00:20:31.728 --> 00:20:33.496
PEOPLE, THE DOLLARS WILL

00:20:33.496 --> 00:20:35.598
CONTINUE TO EXIST, REGARDLESS

00:20:35.598 --> 00:20:38.500
OF WHAT ANYBODY SAYS OR DOES.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.201
&gt;&gt; HEY, GUYS.

00:20:40.201 --> 00:20:40.902

&gt;&gt; HEY! THE NAME’S BAKYURA!

00:20:47.273 --> 00:20:49.341

&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH?

00:20:50.476 --> 00:20:52.243
I MET KANRA IN A CHAT ROOM.

00:20:52.243 --> 00:20:53.511
IS THAT HOW YOU MET HIM?

00:20:53.511 --> 00:20:54.512
&gt;&gt; NO, I KNOW HIM FROM REAL

00:20:54.512 --> 00:20:55.245
LIFE.

00:20:55.245 --> 00:20:56.480
WE’RE KINDA LIKE CO-WORKERS.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.447
AT LEAST, THAT’S HOW IT WOULD

00:20:57.447 --> 00:20:58.448
SEEM ON THE SURFACE.

00:20:58.448 --> 00:20:59.348
&gt;&gt; KYAA!

00:20:59.348 --> 00:21:00.383
&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU GONNA CHOKE AND DIE,

00:21:00.383 --> 00:21:01.417
KANRA?

00:21:01.417 --> 00:21:02.751
&gt;&gt; WOW, THAT WAS A LITTLE HARSH.

00:21:02.751 --> 00:21:04.552
&gt;&gt; THAT’S AN AWFUL THING TO SAY.

00:21:04.552 --> 00:21:05.453
&gt;&gt; MY BAD.

00:21:05.453 --> 00:21:07.288
BUT KANRA IS SUCH AN ASS.

00:21:07.288 --> 00:21:10.556
HAD TO.

00:21:10.556 --> 00:21:13.292
&gt;&gt; HEY, BAKYURA...

00:21:13.292 --> 00:21:15.460
I MAY BE TOTALLY WRONG, BUT...

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.262
MASAOMI? IS THAT YOU?

00:21:18.262 --> 00:21:19.563
LISTEN, IF YOU’D LET ME KNOW,

00:21:19.563 --> 00:21:22.900
IT’D MEAN A LOT TO ME.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.467
&gt;&gt; YOU’VE ACTUALLY MET ME.

00:21:24.467 --> 00:21:25.702
WHY HAVEN’T YOU TOLD ’EM HOW

00:21:25.702 --> 00:21:27.369

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:30.238

00:21:30.238 --> 00:21:30.705
&gt;&gt; HUH?

AWESOMENESS IS SO HUGE, MERE

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.444
NUMBERS CAN’T EVEN EXPRESS IT?

00:21:38.444 --> 00:21:39.745
&gt;&gt; IT MEANS IT’S ABOVE THE HEADS

00:21:39.745 --> 00:21:41.379
OF GRADE SCHOOL KIDS, SO KEEP IT

00:21:41.379 --> 00:21:44.415

WHEN HE DOES, WE SHOULD ACT

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.506

00:22:21.876 --> 00:22:23.510
&gt;&gt; WE’LL DO IT TOGETHER.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:27.313
OKAY?

00:22:27.313 --> 00:22:28.414
&gt;&gt; EVEN NOW, I STILL DON’T

00:22:28.414 --> 00:22:29.649
GET IT.

00:22:29.649 --> 00:22:31.416
BUT IN A WEIRD WAY, I DON’T

00:22:31.416 --> 00:22:33.618
KNOW, I GUESS I SORT OF DO.

00:22:33.618 --> 00:22:35.586
ANYWAY, ONE THING’S FOR SURE.

00:22:35.586 --> 00:22:36.554
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT CHANGED

00:22:36.554 --> 00:22:38.488
MY LIFE.

00:22:38.488 --> 00:22:39.789
BUT THEN AGAIN, NOTHING REALLY

00:22:39.789 --> 00:22:40.990
CHANGED AT ALL.

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:42.451
IT’S THE KIND OF WEIRD THAT

00:22:42.451 --> 00:22:44.391
COULD HAPPEN TO ANYONE.

00:22:44.391 --> 00:22:45.658
AND IT HAPPENED HERE IN

00:22:45.658 --> 00:22:46.658
IKEBUKURO.
