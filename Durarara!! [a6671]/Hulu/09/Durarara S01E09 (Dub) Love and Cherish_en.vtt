MY UNCLE SEEMED POSSESSED BY IT.

00:05:51.844 --> 00:05:53.145
SOMETIMES HE WOULD EVEN SPEAK TO

00:05:53.145 --> 00:05:56.048
IT.

00:05:56.048 --> 00:05:58.084

HAD GIVEN ME.

00:06:01.788 --> 00:06:03.056

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:15.803

00:06:15.803 --> 00:06:17.038
ABOUT ALLOWING SEIJI INTO THE

00:06:17.038 --> 00:06:18.840
STUDY THAT DAY.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.141
IT WAS HARMLESS, JUST PART OF

OUR USUAL PLAY.

00:06:21.843 --> 00:06:23.945

00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:09.835
IT’S JUST AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

00:16:09.835 --> 00:16:10.769
LOVE IS A FEELING.

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:12.137
YOU CAN’T EXPLAIN IT.

00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:13.339
IT HAS NO WORDS!

00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:15.407
&gt;&gt; [grunts]

00:16:15.407 --> 00:16:17.143
&gt;&gt; NOW LET ME GO.

00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:19.379
[horse neighs]

00:16:19.379 --> 00:16:23.716
[crowd screaming]

00:16:23.716 --> 00:16:24.651
[girls shrieking]

00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:26.219
&gt;&gt; both: THE BLACK RIDER!

00:16:26.219 --> 00:16:27.287
&gt;&gt; MY ACTIONS WILL PROVE MY

00:16:27.287 --> 00:16:28.288
LOVE!

00:16:28.288 --> 00:16:29.390
JUST WATCH.

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:31.425
I’LL PROVE IT.

00:16:31.425 --> 00:16:32.560
&gt;&gt; [grunts]

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.594
[growls]

00:16:33.594 --> 00:16:34.462
I LIKE YOU A LOT BETTER THAN

00:16:34.462 --> 00:16:35.764
IZAYA.

00:16:35.764 --> 00:16:37.266
SO I’M ONLY GOING TO SEND YOU

00:16:37.266 --> 00:16:39.201
HOME WITH THIS.

00:16:39.201 --> 00:16:42.237
[smack]

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:48.644
[groans]

00:16:48.644 --> 00:16:49.880
THIS’LL JUST BLEED IF I TAKE IT

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.214
OUT.

00:16:51.214 --> 00:16:53.850
BETTER STOP AND GET A BAND-AID.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.852
OR MAYBE SOME SUPERGLUE WILL DO

00:16:55.852 --> 00:16:57.321
THE TRICK.

00:16:57.321 --> 00:17:00.091
[siren wailing]

00:17:07.132 --> 00:17:08.734
&gt;&gt; SO WHAT YOU’RE SAYING IS YOUR

00:17:08.734 --> 00:17:10.403
HEAD WALKED BY ATTACHED TO

00:17:10.403 --> 00:17:11.337
ANOTHER BODY?

00:17:11.337 --> 00:17:12.538
YOU GRABBED HER, BUT SOME HIGH

00:17:12.538 --> 00:17:13.872
SCHOOL KID INTERCEPTED.

00:17:13.872 --> 00:17:15.141
YOU CHASED HER, BUT THEN SOME

00:17:15.141 --> 00:17:16.209
OTHER HIGH SCHOOL KID ENTERED

00:17:16.209 --> 00:17:17.243
THE SCENE.

00:17:17.243 --> 00:17:18.478
AND THAT’S WHEN THE TWO OF THEM

00:17:18.478 --> 00:17:19.813
ESCAPED WITH YOUR HEAD.

00:17:19.813 --> 00:17:21.348
AND THAT’S WHAT YOU EXPECT ME TO

00:17:21.348 --> 00:17:24.151
BELIEVE?

00:17:24.151 --> 00:17:25.152
&gt;&gt; BELIEVE IT IF YOU WANT.

00:17:25.152 --> 00:17:26.153
IT’S YOUR CHOICE.

00:17:26.153 --> 00:17:27.322
&gt;&gt; NO, I BELIEVE IT.

00:17:27.322 --> 00:17:29.590
BUT WHAT WAS SHIZUO DOING THERE?

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.426
&gt;&gt; OH, I FORGOT THAT PART.

00:17:31.426 --> 00:17:33.228
IZAYA HAD ASKED ME TO BE IN THE

00:17:33.228 --> 00:17:35.163
PARK ON STANDBY FOR A JOB.

00:17:35.163 --> 00:17:36.832
SHIZUO PASSED BY, SO WE JUST

00:17:36.832 --> 00:17:39.435
STARTED TO TALK.

00:17:39.435 --> 00:17:40.636
BUT THEN I GOT A TEXT A FEW

00:17:40.636 --> 00:17:41.938
MINUTES LATER THAT HE DIDN’T

00:17:41.938 --> 00:17:43.172
NEED ME, AND I WAS JUST GETTING

00:17:43.172 --> 00:17:44.741
READY TO COME BACK HERE.

00:17:44.741 --> 00:17:46.743
&gt;&gt; HMM.

00:17:46.743 --> 00:17:48.178
IZAYA CALLED YOU.

00:17:48.178 --> 00:17:49.612
HUH.

00:17:49.612 --> 00:17:50.547
&gt;&gt; REGARDLESS, I WANTED TO TALK

00:17:50.547 --> 00:17:51.949
TO YOU.

00:17:51.949 --> 00:17:52.883
&gt;&gt; YOU’RE STILL SHAKEN UP,

00:17:52.883 --> 00:17:54.385
AREN’T YOU?

00:17:54.385 --> 00:17:55.286
YOU CAN TALK TO ME AS MUCH AS

00:17:55.286 --> 00:17:59.423
YOU LIKE.

00:17:59.423 --> 00:18:00.258
&gt;&gt; WHY IS SOME OTHER BODY

00:18:00.258 --> 00:18:01.826
WALKING AROUND WITH MY HEAD ON

00:18:01.826 --> 00:18:03.828
ITS SHOULDERS?

00:18:03.828 --> 00:18:05.264
&gt;&gt; RELAX.

00:18:05.264 --> 00:18:06.198
I’M NOT GOING TO HAVE A

00:18:06.198 --> 00:18:06.966
CLEAR-CUT ANSWER FOR THIS, BUT

00:18:06.966 --> 00:18:08.233
IF I HAD TO TAKE A GUESS, I

00:18:08.233 --> 00:18:11.671
WOULD PROBABLY SAY SOMETHING

00:18:11.671 --> 00:18:14.975
LIKE, YOUR HEAD WAS LOOKING FOR

00:18:14.975 --> 00:18:15.876
ANOTHER HOST THAT WOULD BE

00:18:15.876 --> 00:18:17.478
APPROPRIATE, AND WHEN IT FOUND

00:18:17.478 --> 00:18:20.347
ONE IT LIKED, IT ATTACHED TO IT.

00:18:20.347 --> 00:18:21.849
&gt;&gt; THAT’S HORRIBLE!

00:18:21.849 --> 00:18:22.950
&gt;&gt; MAYBE YOUR HEAD STUMBLED

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:25.820
ACROSS A FRESH CORPSE.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.223
&gt;&gt; OKAY, ENOUGH.

00:18:28.223 --> 00:18:28.756
[sighs]

00:18:28.756 --> 00:18:30.758
I DON’T KNOW.

00:18:30.758 --> 00:18:31.827
MAYBE WHAT YOU’RE SUGGESTING IS

00:18:31.827 --> 00:18:34.730
POSSIBLE.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:36.399
&gt;&gt; WHAT I DID WASN’T WRONG.

00:18:36.399 --> 00:18:37.300
IT WAS DONE FOR ALL THE RIGHT

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.835
REASONS.

00:18:38.835 --> 00:18:40.937
THE EXPERIMENT WE PERFORMED,

00:18:40.937 --> 00:18:42.572
THAT WAS ALL DONE FOR SEIJI’S

00:18:42.572 --> 00:18:44.441
SAKE.

00:18:44.441 --> 00:18:45.875
&gt;&gt; I HAVE TO GO.

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:46.911
&gt;&gt; IT’S FINE.

00:18:46.911 --> 00:18:47.945
EVERYTHING’S ALL RIGHT NOW.

00:18:47.945 --> 00:18:49.379
&gt;&gt; I HAVE TO GO.

00:18:49.379 --> 00:18:50.314
&gt;&gt; YOU MUST HAVE BEEN SO SCARED.

00:18:50.314 --> 00:18:51.015
&gt;&gt; I HAVE TO GO.

00:18:51.015 --> 00:18:52.250
&gt;&gt; BUT AS YOU CAN SEE, NOTHING

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.251
HAPPENED TO YOU.

00:18:53.251 --> 00:18:54.018
EVEN AFTER SHE ESCAPED FROM HERE

00:18:54.018 --> 00:18:55.887
AND FOUND SEIJI AGAIN, MY LOVE

00:18:55.887 --> 00:18:58.624
FOR HIM NEVER WAIVERED.

00:18:58.624 --> 00:19:00.392
NOT ONCE.

00:19:00.392 --> 00:19:01.860
IT IS ONLY BECAUSE OF MY LOVE

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.029
FOR SEIJI THAT HE HAS ANY LOVE

00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:04.964
FOR THAT GIRL.

00:19:04.964 --> 00:19:06.365
SEIJI KNOWS THIS TO BE TRUE, AND

00:19:06.365 --> 00:19:08.335
SO DO I.

00:19:08.335 --> 00:19:09.269
EVERYTHING MAY HAVE GOTTEN A BIT

00:19:09.269 --> 00:19:10.937
TWISTED, BUT IT WILL STILL WORK

00:19:10.937 --> 00:19:11.972
OUT.

00:19:11.972 --> 00:19:13.273
&gt;&gt; DAMN IT.

00:19:13.273 --> 00:19:16.009
HE WAS WEARING A RAIRA UNIFORM.

00:19:16.009 --> 00:19:17.911
SO THEN, WHO IS HE?

00:19:17.911 --> 00:19:19.813
&gt;&gt; JUST LEAVE IT TO ME.

00:19:19.813 --> 00:19:21.415
I’LL FIND HIM.

00:19:21.415 --> 00:19:23.017
&gt;&gt; WHAT I HAVE TO DO NOW IS FIND

00:19:23.017 --> 00:19:24.352
THAT KID FROM RAIRA.

00:19:24.352 --> 00:19:25.754
THEN I NEED TO BE ABLE TO TALK

00:19:25.754 --> 00:19:26.821
TO MY HEAD.

00:19:26.821 --> 00:19:27.922
&gt;&gt; DO YOU MEAN THE HEAD THAT

00:19:27.922 --> 00:19:32.294
SHRIEKED WHEN IT FIRST SAW YOU?

00:19:32.294 --> 00:19:32.995
HOW DO YOU INTEND TO GET YOUR

00:19:32.995 --> 00:19:34.664
HEAD BACK ANYWAY?

00:19:34.664 --> 00:19:36.732
IT’S ATTACHED TO ANOTHER BODY.

00:19:36.732 --> 00:19:37.968
WHAT’S YOUR PLAN?

00:19:37.968 --> 00:19:39.035
DO YOU THINK SHE’LL JUST SNAP

00:19:39.035 --> 00:19:42.373
OFF HER HEAD AND GIVE IT TO YOU?

00:19:42.373 --> 00:19:44.308
&gt;&gt; [sighs]

00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:47.411
&gt;&gt; CELTY...

00:19:47.411 --> 00:19:48.946
&gt;&gt; I JUST DON’T WANT TO ACCEPT

00:19:48.946 --> 00:19:50.347
THAT MY HEAD AND MY MEMORIES ARE

00:19:50.347 --> 00:19:51.583
GONE FOR GOOD.

00:19:51.583 --> 00:19:52.584
THAT MEANS EVERYTHING I’VE DONE

00:19:52.584 --> 00:19:54.552
FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS HAS BEEN

00:19:54.552 --> 00:19:59.525
A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.

00:19:59.525 --> 00:20:01.594
&gt;&gt; IT WASN’T A WASTE OF TIME.

00:20:01.594 --> 00:20:02.929
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, I’M GOING TO GO

00:20:02.929 --> 00:20:04.030
GET HER NOW AND BRING HER BACK

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:05.364
FOR YOU.

00:20:05.364 --> 00:20:06.032
YOU JUST STAY HERE UNTIL I

00:20:06.032 --> 00:20:11.071
RETURN.

00:20:11.071 --> 00:20:12.539
BY THE WAY.

00:20:12.539 --> 00:20:16.377
YOUR CELL PHONE--WHERE IS IT?

00:20:16.377 --> 00:20:17.478
&gt;&gt; I DON’T KNOW.

00:20:17.478 --> 00:20:18.879
I REMEMBER PUTTING IT IN MY BAG,

00:20:18.879 --> 00:20:20.982
BUT IT’S GONE NOW.

00:20:20.982 --> 00:20:22.117
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:20:22.117 --> 00:20:23.418
&gt;&gt; SHE NEEDS ME.

00:20:23.418 --> 00:20:25.053
I HAVE TO FIND HER!

00:20:25.053 --> 00:20:27.356
WE ARE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER.

00:20:27.356 --> 00:20:29.992
&gt;&gt; AH...I HEAR YOU.

00:20:29.992 --> 00:20:31.694
DON’T WORRY, NOW.

00:20:31.694 --> 00:20:36.433
YOU JUST LEAVE EVERYTHING TO ME.

00:20:36.433 --> 00:20:38.636
[sighs]

00:20:38.636 --> 00:20:43.006
THAT GIRL’S GOT NERVE.

00:20:43.006 --> 00:20:44.375
A DOLL SHOULD BEHAVE LIKE A DOLL

00:20:44.375 --> 00:20:46.077
AND STAY PUT.

00:20:46.077 --> 00:20:47.111
THE LAST THING IT SHOULD DO IS

00:20:47.111 --> 00:20:48.713
INTERFERE WITH MY LOVE FOR

00:20:48.713 --> 00:20:51.150
SEIJI.

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:52.952
I’VE MADE UP MY MIND.

00:20:52.952 --> 00:20:54.619
I DON’T WANT ANY MORE REGRETS.

00:20:54.619 --> 00:20:57.757
I’M THROUGH WITH THAT.

00:20:57.757 --> 00:20:58.758
OKAY, LISTEN.

00:20:58.758 --> 00:20:59.725
I WANT YOU TO ROUND UP EVERY

00:20:59.725 --> 00:21:01.494
PERSON WE HAVE FOR THIS.

00:21:01.494 --> 00:21:04.064
I WANT HER DEAD OR ALIVE.

00:21:04.064 --> 00:21:05.431
IF YOU HAVE ANY TROUBLE BRINGING

00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:07.033
HER BACK, THEN DISPOSE OF HER.

00:21:13.107 --> 00:21:16.444
&gt;&gt; [sighs]

00:21:28.124 --> 00:21:33.163
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

00:21:33.163 --> 00:21:34.698
I SEE.

00:21:34.698 --> 00:21:36.166
EVERYONE IS BUSY.

00:21:36.166 --> 00:21:37.835
THIS’LL BE FUN.

00:21:37.835 --> 00:21:39.704
THIS’LL BE FUN, THIS’LL BE FUN.

00:21:39.704 --> 00:21:40.705
THERE’S JUST SO MUCH GOING ON IN

00:21:40.705 --> 00:21:41.706
THIS TOWN THAT EVEN I DON’T KNOW

00:21:41.706 --> 00:21:43.909
ANYTHING ABOUT.

00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:44.810
IT’S AN ENDLESS SEA OF

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:46.144
ENTERTAINMENT.

00:21:46.144 --> 00:21:47.813
THIS IS WHY I LOVE THIS BUSTLING

00:21:47.813 --> 00:21:49.448
HOTBED OF HUMANS.

00:21:49.448 --> 00:21:50.616
I LOVE THEM.

00:21:50.616 --> 00:21:52.084
I LOVE THEM ALL.

00:21:52.084 --> 00:21:54.186
I LOVE THEM ALL SO MUCH!

00:21:54.186 --> 00:21:58.525
AND THAT IS WHY MY LOVELY LITTLE

00:21:58.525 --> 00:22:01.028
HUMANS SHOULD LOVE AND ADORE ME

00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:04.064
TOO.

00:22:09.737 --> 00:22:10.872
&gt;&gt; THANKS A LOT.

00:22:10.872 --> 00:22:12.240
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU OKAY NOW?

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.476
CAN YOU ANSWER MY QUESTIONS?

00:22:14.476 --> 00:22:15.644
&gt;&gt; MM...

00:22:15.644 --> 00:22:17.179
&gt;&gt; YOU SAID YOU DON’T REMEMBER

00:22:17.179 --> 00:22:19.915
ANYTHING.

00:22:19.915 --> 00:22:21.617
SO THEN, DO YOU THINK MAYBE YOU

00:22:21.617 --> 00:22:25.922
HAVE AMNESIA?

00:22:25.922 --> 00:22:27.557
WELL, I’M GONNA SUGGEST IT

00:22:27.557 --> 00:22:28.524
AGAIN.

00:22:28.524 --> 00:22:29.726
I THINK WE SHOULD GO TO THE

00:22:29.726 --> 00:22:32.496
POLICE, OR TO A HOSPITAL.

00:22:32.496 --> 00:22:36.100
&gt;&gt; MM. I’M SORRY.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.134
SORRY.

00:22:37.134 --> 00:22:37.969
I’M SORRY!

00:22:37.969 --> 00:22:39.103
&gt;&gt; IT’S OKAY, NO BIG DEAL.

00:22:39.103 --> 00:22:39.937
&gt;&gt; I’M SORRY.

00:22:39.937 --> 00:22:42.207
&gt;&gt; DON’T APOLOGIZE.

00:22:42.207 --> 00:22:43.275
&gt;&gt; I HAVE TO GO.

00:22:43.275 --> 00:22:44.843
BEFORE THAT WOMAN GETS IN MY

00:22:44.843 --> 00:22:46.178
WAY.

00:22:46.178 --> 00:22:49.548
&gt;&gt; FOREVER AND EVER.

00:22:49.548 --> 00:22:51.584
&gt;&gt; I HAVE TO GO.

00:22:51.584 --> 00:22:53.887
&gt;&gt; SEIJI.

00:22:53.887 --> 00:22:56.756
&gt;&gt; SEIJI.
