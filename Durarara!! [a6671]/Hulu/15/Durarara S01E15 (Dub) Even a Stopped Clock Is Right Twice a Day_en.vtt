&gt;&gt; YEAH, WELL, THIS SHIZUO YOU

00:07:21.545 --> 00:07:22.213
SPEAK OF--

00:07:22.213 --> 00:07:24.048
&gt;&gt; I’M GETTING ANNOYED.

00:07:24.048 --> 00:07:24.783
&gt;&gt; EH?

00:07:24.783 --> 00:07:26.918
&gt;&gt; I KNOW A FEW THINGS, BUT JUST

00:07:26.918 --> 00:07:28.821
WHAT I HAVE TO KNOW IS TROUBLE

00:07:28.821 --> 00:07:30.189
FOR ME, SO I TRY TO STAY AHEAD

00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:30.856
OF HIM.

00:07:30.856 --> 00:07:32.592
I HATE TALKING ABOUT HIM.

00:07:32.592 --> 00:07:34.094
THEREFORE, I WON’T.

00:07:34.094 --> 00:07:35.696
&gt;&gt; UH, JUST A FEW QUESTIONS.

00:07:35.696 --> 00:07:37.164
&gt;&gt; [blows]

00:07:37.164 --> 00:07:38.800
BY THE WAY, MR. NIEKAWA, HOW’S

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.802
THAT DAUGHTER OF YOURS DOING?

00:07:40.802 --> 00:07:41.769
&gt;&gt; EH?

00:07:41.769 --> 00:07:43.005
&gt;&gt; AS A PARENT, YOU MUST BE

00:07:43.005 --> 00:07:44.607
QUITE CONCERNED, HER

00:07:44.607 --> 00:07:46.075
TRANSFERRING SCHOOLS LIKE THAT.

00:07:46.075 --> 00:07:47.577
SIX MONTHS AGO, YOU APPROACHED

00:07:47.577 --> 00:07:48.312
SHIZUO.

00:07:48.312 --> 00:07:49.579
THAT’S WHEN YOU AND AN INNOCENT

00:07:49.579 --> 00:07:50.881
LAMPPOST SAILED ACROSS THE

00:07:50.881 --> 00:07:52.650
NIGHT SKY.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:53.751
IF YOU KEEP SNIFFING AROUND LIKE

00:07:53.751 --> 00:07:55.020
THIS, WELL IT JUST MIGHT BEGIN

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.823
TO INTERFERE WITH MY OWN WORK.

00:07:57.823 --> 00:07:59.291
&gt;&gt; JUST WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?

00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:00.292
&gt;&gt; I’M SURE YOU ALREADY KNOW

00:08:00.292 --> 00:08:01.728
THIS, BUT A LOT OF BAD STUFF IS

00:08:01.728 --> 00:08:04.965
BEGINNING TO BREW IN IKEBUKURO.

00:08:04.965 --> 00:08:06.233
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:08:06.233 --> 00:08:07.335
THAT THE WAR BETWEEN THE DOLLARS

00:08:07.335 --> 00:08:08.336
AND THE YELLOW SCARVES--

00:08:08.336 --> 00:08:09.804
&gt;&gt; THERE’S THAT, AND THEN THERE

00:08:09.804 --> 00:08:11.105
ARE THE SLASHER ATTACKS THAT

00:08:11.105 --> 00:08:12.674
STARTED IT ALL.

00:08:12.674 --> 00:08:13.776
&gt;&gt; THE SLASHER.

00:08:13.776 --> 00:08:15.044
&gt;&gt; AS IF HAVING ONE URBAN LEGEND

00:08:15.044 --> 00:08:16.346
SPIRALING OUT OF CONTROL WASN’T

00:08:16.346 --> 00:08:18.248
ENOUGH.

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:18.915
OH...

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:20.584
I KNOW.

00:08:20.584 --> 00:08:22.253
BACK TO SHIZUO HEIWAJIMA.

00:08:22.253 --> 00:08:23.721
I’LL HELP YOU OUT AND INTRODUCE

00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:25.022
YOU TO A FRIEND OF HIS.

00:08:25.022 --> 00:08:26.324
&gt;&gt; ORIHARA, THE INFO BROKER,

00:08:26.324 --> 00:08:27.593
INTRODUCED ME TO A RATHER ODD

00:08:27.593 --> 00:08:29.628
INDIVIDUAL.

00:08:29.628 --> 00:08:30.663
&gt;&gt; AND HERE’S ONE LITTLE BIT OF

00:08:30.663 --> 00:08:32.666
ADVICE FOR YOU.

00:08:32.666 --> 00:08:33.733
WHATEVER YOU DO, DON’T TALK TO

00:08:33.733 --> 00:08:34.601
SHIZU-CHAN ABOUT HIS YOUNGER

00:08:34.601 --> 00:08:35.269
BROTHER.

00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:36.370
&gt;&gt; WISH YOU’D TOLD ME THAT SIX

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:37.638
MONTHS AGO.

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:42.778
WHEN HE BROUGHT UP MY DAUGHTER,

00:08:42.778 --> 00:08:44.246
HE CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD.

00:08:44.246 --> 00:08:45.748
MY DAUGHTER’S IN HER SECOND YEAR

00:08:45.748 --> 00:08:48.819
OF HIGH SCHOOL.

00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:50.053
IT’S JUST BEEN THE TWO OF US

00:08:50.053 --> 00:08:51.389
SINCE MY WIFE RAN OFF.

00:08:51.389 --> 00:08:52.891
HONESTLY, I DOUBT SHE THINKS TOO

00:08:52.891 --> 00:08:54.759
MUCH OF ME.

00:08:54.759 --> 00:08:56.128
I STARTED WRITING THESE ARTICLES

00:08:56.128 --> 00:08:57.229
BECAUSE OF HER.

00:08:57.229 --> 00:08:58.731
I DIDN’T WANT TO DO IT.

00:08:58.731 --> 00:09:02.769
WE NEEDED THE MONEY.

00:09:02.769 --> 00:09:03.303
&gt;&gt; HI.

00:09:03.303 --> 00:09:05.206
I’M CELTY, THE TRANSPORTER.

00:09:05.206 --> 00:09:08.643
[camera clicks]

00:09:08.643 --> 00:09:09.844
&gt;&gt; WOW, UH...

00:09:09.844 --> 00:09:10.678
&gt;&gt; YOU WANTED TO ASK ABOUT

00:09:10.678 --> 00:09:11.246
SHIZUO.

00:09:11.246 --> 00:09:12.681
I KNOW HIM, HE’S A GOOD FRIEND

00:09:12.681 --> 00:09:13.816
OF MINE.

00:09:13.816 --> 00:09:15.018
&gt;&gt; [chuckles]

00:09:15.018 --> 00:09:16.185
&gt;&gt; BUT GET HIM MAD AND HE’S A

00:09:16.185 --> 00:09:17.354
BIT SCARY.

00:09:17.354 --> 00:09:18.855
&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY, I’M TRYING TO WRITE

00:09:18.855 --> 00:09:20.090
AN ARTICLE ON WHO WOULD BE THE

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:21.191
TOUGHEST GUY TO FIGHT AROUND

00:09:21.191 --> 00:09:22.860
HERE.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.095
&gt;&gt; YOUR MAGAZINE SEEMS TO DO A

00:09:24.095 --> 00:09:26.097
LOT OF THOSE ARTICLES, RANKING

00:09:26.097 --> 00:09:28.134
BIKER GANGS AND STUFF.

00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:30.002
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THANKS FOR READING IT.

00:09:30.002 --> 00:09:31.170
ANYWAY, SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.672
SUGGESTED YOU WOULD BE THE

00:09:32.672 --> 00:09:33.974
TOUGHEST PERSON TO GO UP AGAINST

00:09:33.974 --> 00:09:36.210
RIGHT NOW.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.381
IS IT...LAUGHING?

00:09:39.381 --> 00:09:40.882
&gt;&gt; THAT’S RIDICULOUS, SHIZUO IS

00:09:40.882 --> 00:09:43.686
WAY STRONGER THAN I AM.

00:09:43.686 --> 00:09:45.121
HE’S SO DANGEROUS IT’S SCARY.

00:09:45.121 --> 00:09:46.189
HOW DO I PUT THIS?

00:09:46.189 --> 00:09:47.223
IT’S NOT LIKE HE HAS ANY KIND OF

00:09:47.223 --> 00:09:49.193
REAL SKILL OR TRAINING.

00:09:49.193 --> 00:09:50.394
PEOPLE PROBABLY SAY HE’S LIKE A

00:09:50.394 --> 00:09:52.697
DEMON OR AN UNTAMED BEAST.

00:09:52.697 --> 00:09:54.199
BUT IF HE’S AN ALIEN...

00:09:54.199 --> 00:09:55.400
NO, EWW! EWW!

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.869
SORRY, I HAVE A LITTLE GREEN MEN

00:09:56.869 --> 00:09:57.936
TRAUMA.

00:09:57.936 --> 00:09:58.837
WHATEVER!

00:09:58.837 --> 00:10:00.073
WHAT I’M SAYING IS YOU CAN BE AN

00:10:00.073 --> 00:10:01.240
EXCELLENT MARTIAL ARTIST, BUT

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.776
ONE SHOT TO THE HEAD AND YOU’RE

00:10:02.776 --> 00:10:03.343
DONE.

00:10:03.343 --> 00:10:05.412
AND SHIZUO, HE’S THAT HANDGUN.

00:10:05.412 --> 00:10:06.881
HE IS LIKE NOTHING ELSE YOU’VE

00:10:06.881 --> 00:10:07.848
EVER SEEN...

00:10:07.848 --> 00:10:08.449
&gt;&gt; I WAS MOVED.

00:10:08.449 --> 00:10:09.918
THE URBAN LEGEND HAD SAID IT

00:10:09.918 --> 00:10:10.752
ALL.

00:10:10.752 --> 00:10:11.920
I TOO HAD SEEN WHAT SHIZUO

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.256
HEIWAJIMA CAN DO.

00:10:14.256 --> 00:10:15.325
BUT WHAT IT SAID CAPTURED HIM

00:10:15.325 --> 00:10:16.426
PERFECTLY.

00:10:16.426 --> 00:10:18.428
IT’S TRUE.

00:10:18.428 --> 00:10:20.998
HIS STRENGTH IS UNBELIEVABLE.

00:10:20.998 --> 00:10:22.300
SOMEHOW, THE ADRENALINE IN HIS

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.367
BRAIN MANAGES TO TAP INTO AN

00:10:23.367 --> 00:10:26.205
EXTRAORDINARY LEVEL OF POWER.

00:10:26.205 --> 00:10:27.272
AND FOR A SINGLE MOMENT, HIS

00:10:27.272 --> 00:10:28.874
STRENGTH TRANSCENDS HUMAN

00:10:28.874 --> 00:10:30.510
LIMITS.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:33.213
&gt;&gt; I GOT YOU.

00:10:33.213 --> 00:10:34.481
YOU KNOW, I’VE GOT ONE MORE

00:10:34.481 --> 00:10:36.483
RANDOM QUESTION FOR YOU.

00:10:36.483 --> 00:10:38.220
&gt;&gt; SURE, WHAT IS IT?

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.487
&gt;&gt; IF YOU WOULDN’T MIND, WOULD

00:10:39.487 --> 00:10:42.291
YOU REMOVE YOUR HELMET FOR ME?

00:10:42.291 --> 00:10:44.928
IT’S OKAY IF YOU DON’T.

00:10:46.162 --> 00:10:48.833
[gasps]

00:10:52.938 --> 00:10:57.109
THAT’S NOT POSSIBLE.

00:10:57.109 --> 00:10:58.477
THERE’S NO WAY.

00:10:58.477 --> 00:10:59.946
CELTY MUST BE SOME KIND OF

00:10:59.946 --> 00:11:01.381
AN ILLUSIONIST.

00:11:01.381 --> 00:11:02.482
I PULLED MYSELF TOGETHER AND

00:11:02.482 --> 00:11:04.952
WENT BACK TO MY QUESTIONS.

00:11:04.952 --> 00:11:06.220
I HEARD ALL ABOUT THE DOLLARS

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.922
AND THE YELLOW SCARVES.

00:11:07.922 --> 00:11:09.224
THERE’S RUMORS OUT THERE THAT

00:11:09.224 --> 00:11:10.125
THE DOLLARS DON’T SEEM TO

00:11:10.125 --> 00:11:10.826
ACKNOWLEDGE.

00:11:10.826 --> 00:11:12.094
SO BECAUSE OF THIS, THEY SAY

00:11:12.094 --> 00:11:13.363
THAT THE HEAD OF THE YELLOW

00:11:13.363 --> 00:11:15.098
SCARVES IS ABOUT TO MAKE A MOVE.

00:11:15.098 --> 00:11:16.432
&gt;&gt; SO WHO IS THIS HEAD GUY?

00:11:16.432 --> 00:11:18.134
&gt;&gt; WE DON’T HAVE ANY IDEA.

00:11:18.134 --> 00:11:19.236
I DOUBT EVEN THE YOUNGER GUYS

00:11:19.236 --> 00:11:20.471
IN THE YELLOW SCARVES KNOW

00:11:20.471 --> 00:11:22.039
WHO HE IS.

00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:23.976
&gt;&gt; WHOEVER THIS HEAD GUY IS, HE

00:11:23.976 --> 00:11:25.310
GAVE THE YELLOW SCARVES STRICT

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:26.912
ORDERS TO DO ONE THING.

00:11:26.912 --> 00:11:30.049
STAY AWAY FROM IZAYA ORIHARA.

00:11:30.049 --> 00:11:31.351
I WONDER...

00:11:31.351 --> 00:11:37.192
COULD THIS BE THE TOUGHEST GUY?

00:11:37.192 --> 00:11:38.359
ACCORDING TO THE YELLOW SCARVES,

00:11:38.359 --> 00:11:39.861
THE DOLLARS WERE THE ONES

00:11:39.861 --> 00:11:41.063
WHO WERE BEHIND THE SLASHER

00:11:41.063 --> 00:11:42.498
ATTACKS LATELY.

00:11:42.498 --> 00:11:44.166
A FEW DAYS AGO, THESE HIGH

00:11:44.166 --> 00:11:45.268
SCHOOL GIRLS WERE ATTACKED BY

00:11:45.268 --> 00:11:47.137
THE SLASHER.

00:11:47.137 --> 00:11:50.274
BUT ONE WALKED AWAY UNHARMED.

00:11:50.274 --> 00:11:51.509
WHEN I HEARD THAT, IT MADE ME

00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:53.011
START THINKING ABOUT MY OWN

00:11:53.011 --> 00:11:55.114
DAUGHTER.

00:11:55.114 --> 00:11:56.381
THE KIND OF THINGS A FATHER

00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:57.483
WOULD DO TO PROTECT HIS DAUGHTER

00:11:57.483 --> 00:12:00.153
FROM THE SLASHER.

00:12:00.153 --> 00:12:01.421
BUT RIGHT NOW MY DAUGHTER IS

00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:02.389
LIKE AN ALIEN I HAVE NO HOPE OF

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:04.325
UNDERSTANDING.

00:12:04.325 --> 00:12:05.526
ENOUGH!

00:12:05.526 --> 00:12:07.329
I LOVE MY DAUGHTER.

00:12:07.329 --> 00:12:08.463
WE’RE GOING TO TALK THIS OUT.

00:12:08.463 --> 00:12:09.497
[knife stabs]

00:12:09.497 --> 00:12:12.268
[groaning]

00:12:26.185 --> 00:12:27.086
[computer beeps]

00:12:27.086 --> 00:12:28.320
&gt;&gt; DID YOU HEAR?

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.257
THE MOST RECENT SLASHER VICTIM.

00:12:30.257 --> 00:12:31.624
HE’S A REPORTER.

00:12:31.624 --> 00:12:33.093
HE WAS WRITING AN ARTICLE FOR

00:12:33.093 --> 00:12:34.228
THAT MAGAZINE, THE TOKYO

00:12:34.228 --> 00:12:34.895
WARRIOR.

00:12:34.895 --> 00:12:35.629
&gt;&gt; REALLY?

00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:38.132
A MAGAZINE WRITER?

00:12:38.132 --> 00:12:39.101
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

00:12:39.101 --> 00:12:39.668
IS THIS TRUE?

00:12:39.668 --> 00:12:41.003
&gt;&gt; COME ON!

00:12:41.003 --> 00:12:42.672
HAVE I EVER LIED TO YOU?

00:12:42.672 --> 00:12:44.975
&gt;&gt; IS HE OKAY?

00:12:44.975 --> 00:12:46.477
&gt;&gt; SETTON, DO YOU KNOW HIM?

00:12:46.477 --> 00:12:48.312
&gt;&gt; UH, NO.

00:12:48.312 --> 00:12:49.346
I’M JUST A BIG FAN OF HIS

00:12:49.346 --> 00:12:50.582
ARTICLES.

00:12:50.582 --> 00:12:51.383
&gt;&gt; REALLY?

00:12:51.383 --> 00:12:53.251
I’LL HAVE TO CHECK HIM OUT.

00:12:53.251 --> 00:12:55.087
PRETTY SCARY STUFF THOUGH.

00:12:55.087 --> 00:12:56.322
&gt;&gt; I HOPE THE COPS CATCH HIM

00:12:56.322 --> 00:12:58.124
SOON.

00:12:58.124 --> 00:12:59.292
&gt;&gt; SHE’S BACK!

00:12:59.292 --> 00:13:00.159
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:13:00.159 --> 00:13:02.229
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:13:02.229 --> 00:13:04.399
&gt;&gt; MORE CUTTING!

00:13:04.399 --> 00:13:06.067
YEAH, WELL I’M THE ONE WHO WANTS

00:13:06.067 --> 00:13:09.338
TO CUT YOU.

00:13:09.338 --> 00:13:10.639
&gt;&gt; HEY, SAIKA.

&gt;&gt; THE GIRL HAS THE SAME DREAM

00:14:34.575 --> 00:14:36.244
EVERY NIGHT.

00:14:36.244 --> 00:14:38.179
A HAPPY FAMILY, THE KIND YOU SEE

00:14:38.179 --> 00:14:40.416
IN SOME PORTRAIT.

00:14:40.416 --> 00:14:43.253
BUT IT WAS JUST AN ILLUSION.

00:14:43.253 --> 00:14:44.321
FIVE YEARS AGO, BOTH OF HER

00:14:44.321 --> 00:14:45.623

SHE WAS THE ONLY SURVIVOR.

00:14:50.228 --> 00:14:52.764
BUT SHE STILL HAS THIS DREAM.

00:14:52.764 --> 00:14:54.233
SHE DREAMS OF THE HAPPY FAMILY

00:14:54.233 --> 00:14:56.402
SHE’LL NEVER HAVE.

00:14:56.402 --> 00:14:57.470

00:14:59.339 --> 00:15:00.707
THAT ACCIDENT WAS THE VERY FIRST

00:15:00.707 --> 00:15:03.344
TIME THE SLASHER HAD EVER

00:15:03.344 --> 00:15:06.714
APPEARED IN THIS CITY.

00:15:11.354 --> 00:15:12.656
BUT ARE YOU OKAY?

00:15:12.656 --> 00:15:13.357
&gt;&gt; I’M FINE.

00:15:13.357 --> 00:15:14.591
&gt;&gt; SHE FELT SHE WAS BEING QUITE

00:15:16.694 --> 00:15:18.195
SHE KNEW WHAT THE TEACHER’S

00:15:18.195 --> 00:15:19.330
MOTIVES WERE.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.633
YET SHE DID NOTHING TO STOP HIM.

00:15:21.633 --> 00:15:23.202
SHE SIMPLY WITHDREW HERSELF FROM

00:15:23.202 --> 00:15:24.436
THE MOMENT AND THEN WAITED FOR

00:15:24.436 --> 00:15:25.605
IT TO PASS.

00:15:25.605 --> 00:15:26.873
&gt;&gt; WHO’S TO SAY THE SLASHER

00:15:26.873 --> 00:15:28.241

00:15:31.412 --> 00:15:33.447
&gt;&gt; SHE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT

00:15:33.447 --> 00:15:35.417
THAT SHE WAS A PARASITE,

00:15:35.417 --> 00:15:36.685
FEEDING OFF THOSE AROUND HER.

00:15:36.685 --> 00:15:38.287
&gt;&gt; ANRI!

00:15:38.287 --> 00:15:39.354

&gt;&gt; THERE WAS A BIG GAP IN MY

00:16:05.654 --> 00:16:06.555
MEMORY.

00:16:06.555 --> 00:16:08.790
