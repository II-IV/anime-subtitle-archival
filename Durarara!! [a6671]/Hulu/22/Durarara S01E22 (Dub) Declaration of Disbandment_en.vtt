00:18:12.512 --> 00:18:13.713
LAST TIME...

00:18:13.713 --> 00:18:16.349
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU THINKING

00:18:16.349 --> 00:18:19.385
AT THIS VERY SECOND?

00:18:25.691 --> 00:18:27.826
&gt;&gt; THE DOLLARS...

00:18:27.826 --> 00:18:31.496

00:18:34.332 --> 00:18:35.433
THE GANG?

00:18:35.433 --> 00:18:37.868
&gt;&gt; IS THE LEADER RUNNING AWAY?

00:18:37.868 --> 00:18:40.137
&gt;&gt; IS HE REALLY GONNA END IT?

00:18:40.137 --> 00:18:44.374
&gt;&gt; WELL, AS OF 9:34 P.M....

00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:45.775
THE IKEBUKURO DOLLARS WERE

00:18:45.775 --> 00:18:47.411

00:18:47.411 --> 00:18:48.445
HUH.

00:18:48.445 --> 00:18:49.346
&gt;&gt; YOU’RE WRONG.

00:18:49.346 --> 00:18:50.880
IF WE DISAPPEAR, THAT JUST MEANS

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.315
WE’RE GOING BACK TO BEING

00:18:52.315 --> 00:18:53.449
COLORLESS, INVISIBLE.

00:18:53.449 --> 00:18:55.284
&gt;&gt; THE BOSS CAN’T BAIL NOW.

00:18:55.284 --> 00:18:57.153
&gt;&gt; I SAY WE STILL GOTTA BELIEVE.

00:18:57.153 --> 00:18:58.721

00:18:58.721 --> 00:18:59.722
&gt;&gt; WHY YOU DO THIS?

00:18:59.722 --> 00:19:03.592
&gt;&gt; THE DOLLARS WILL DISAPPEAR.

00:19:03.592 --> 00:19:06.628

&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:19:13.435 --> 00:19:14.536
I CAN’T LOG ON ANYMORE.

&gt;&gt; NO! SERIOUSLY?

00:19:16.603 --> 00:19:18.839
AW.

00:19:18.839 --> 00:19:20.541
&gt;&gt; I STILL SEE THE HOME PAGE

00:19:20.541 --> 00:19:22.609
THERE, BUT THE FORUM WHERE

00:19:22.609 --> 00:19:23.777
EVERYONE HOOKED UP IS COMPLETELY

00:19:23.777 --> 00:19:25.278

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.248
&gt;&gt; I GUESS THAT HE REALLY MEANT

00:19:28.248 --> 00:19:28.848
IT.

00:19:28.848 --> 00:19:30.316
&gt;&gt; THAT’S ENOUGH.

00:19:30.316 --> 00:19:31.851
IT’S OVER.

00:19:31.851 --> 00:19:34.487
&gt;&gt; MY TIME ALONE FELT VERY LONG.

00:19:34.487 --> 00:19:35.788
BUT IT GAVE ME TIME TO REALLY

00:19:35.788 --> 00:19:36.856
THINK.

00:19:36.856 --> 00:19:39.391
AND THEN, AFTER A WHILE,

00:19:39.391 --> 00:19:41.426
I BEGAN TO SEE THEIR FACES.

00:19:41.426 --> 00:19:43.562
THEIR SMILES.

00:19:43.562 --> 00:19:44.896
IT WAS SO CLEAR.

00:19:44.896 --> 00:19:47.932
THEY WOULDN’T GO AWAY.

00:19:55.573 --> 00:19:58.475
CELTY, DO YOU HAVE TIME FOR US

00:19:58.475 --> 00:20:00.343
TO TALK?

00:20:00.343 --> 00:20:01.511
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE.

00:20:01.511 --> 00:20:02.679
ACTUALLY, I WANTED TO TALK WITH

00:20:02.679 --> 00:20:03.913
YOU, TOO.

00:20:03.913 --> 00:20:05.615
&gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE SINCE YOU KNOW

00:20:05.615 --> 00:20:07.650
THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT ME, THAT I

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:11.620
CAN TELL YOU EVERYTHING.

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:12.921
&gt;&gt; I SEE.

00:20:12.921 --> 00:20:15.457
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

00:20:15.457 --> 00:20:17.626
SO THEN I’M GUESSING NEITHER

00:20:17.626 --> 00:20:18.627
OF THEM KNOWS WHO YOU REALLY

00:20:18.627 --> 00:20:20.829
ARE.

00:20:20.829 --> 00:20:21.997
&gt;&gt; THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THERE

00:20:21.997 --> 00:20:23.864
FOR ME, NO MATTER WHAT--

00:20:23.864 --> 00:20:27.502
BOTH MIKADO AND MASAOMI, TOO.

00:20:27.502 --> 00:20:29.604
BUT I NEVER ONCE TOLD THEM.

00:20:29.604 --> 00:20:30.971
&gt;&gt; LISTEN, FIRST WE HAVE TO STOP

00:20:30.971 --> 00:20:32.439
THIS GANG WAR.

00:20:32.439 --> 00:20:34.008
&gt;&gt; YOU’RE RIGHT.

00:20:34.008 --> 00:20:36.276
&gt;&gt; SO IN ORDER TO DO THAT,

00:20:36.276 --> 00:20:37.577
WE HAVE TO TALK TO MIKADO.

00:20:37.577 --> 00:20:39.546
&gt;&gt; UM...

00:20:39.546 --> 00:20:41.948
WHY WOULD WE TALK TO HIM?

00:20:41.948 --> 00:20:43.316
&gt;&gt; ANRI, HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW

00:20:43.316 --> 00:20:44.683

00:20:44.683 --> 00:20:45.451
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:20:45.451 --> 00:20:47.986
&gt;&gt; YOU CLEARLY DON’T KNOW.

00:20:47.986 --> 00:20:49.755
HE’S A LOT LIKE YOU.

00:20:49.755 --> 00:20:50.889

SOMETHING IMPORTANT FROM YOU

00:20:51.857 --> 00:20:53.291
IS PROBABLY ’CAUSE YOU MEAN SO

00:20:53.291 --> 00:20:55.460
MUCH TO HIM.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.529
BUT HE SHOULD BE THE ONE TO TELL

00:20:57.529 --> 00:20:58.830
YOU, NOT ME.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.498
