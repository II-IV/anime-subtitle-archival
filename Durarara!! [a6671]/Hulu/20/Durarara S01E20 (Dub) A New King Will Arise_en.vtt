BUT FOR SOME REASON,

00:06:18.056 --> 00:06:19.057

00:06:31.037 --> 00:06:32.104
&gt;&gt; NO, IT’S ALL GOOD.

00:06:32.104 --> 00:06:33.005
WE’RE THE ONES WHO SHOULD

00:06:33.005 --> 00:06:33.906
APOLOGIZE.

00:06:33.906 --> 00:06:35.442
WE DO HONESTLY FEEL BAD ABOUT

00:06:35.442 --> 00:06:36.443

00:06:36.443 --> 00:06:37.811
THAT WASN’T RIGHT.

00:06:37.811 --> 00:06:39.847
&gt;&gt; NO. WHAT I REALLY SHOULD DO

00:06:39.847 --> 00:06:41.214
IS THANK YOU GUYS FOR WHAT YOU

00:06:41.214 --> 00:06:42.850
DID.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.185
&gt;&gt; LISTEN, YOU’VE GOT EVERY

00:06:44.185 --> 00:06:45.919
RIGHT TO HATE US.

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:47.956
WHAT OUR GUYS DID TO HER...

00:06:47.956 --> 00:06:48.923
IT WAS OUT OF CONTROL.

00:06:48.923 --> 00:06:49.924
SHE WAS JUST SOME MIDDLE-SCHOOL

00:06:49.924 --> 00:06:50.391
KID.

00:06:50.391 --> 00:06:51.926
&gt;&gt; BUT KYOHEI, IT WASN’T YOU

00:06:51.926 --> 00:06:52.427
WHO DID IT.

00:06:52.427 --> 00:06:53.227
IT WAS JUST--

00:06:53.227 --> 00:06:55.096
&gt;&gt; BUT I WAS STILL A PART OF IT.

00:06:55.096 --> 00:06:56.131
AND NO MATTER WHAT,

00:06:56.131 --> 00:06:57.832
YOU CAN NEVER ESCAPE THAT.

00:06:57.832 --> 00:06:58.901
&gt;&gt; [sighs]

00:06:58.901 --> 00:06:59.969
&gt;&gt; LET ME BE PERFECTLY CLEAR

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:01.036
ABOUT THIS.

00:07:01.036 --> 00:07:02.705
SEE, I HAVE NO IDEA WHO

00:07:02.705 --> 00:07:03.706
OUR BOSS IS, AND I HAVE

00:07:03.706 --> 00:07:05.841
NO DESIRE TO FIND OUT.

00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:07.877
AND FOR THE VERY LAST TIME,

00:07:07.877 --> 00:07:08.979
THE DOLLARS HAVE NOTHING TO DO

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:10.146
WITH THE SLASHER,

00:07:10.146 --> 00:07:11.181
AND NO REASON TO FIGHT

00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:12.348
THE YELLOW SCARVES.

00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:13.950
&gt;&gt; I HEAR YA.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:15.252
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, THERE IS THIS GUY

00:07:15.252 --> 00:07:16.353
OUT THERE, AND HE SAYS

00:07:16.353 --> 00:07:17.354
HE KNOWS WHO THE LEADER

00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:18.389
OF THE DOLLARS IS.

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:20.291
&gt;&gt; [gasps] WELL, WHO IS IT?

00:07:20.291 --> 00:07:21.292
&gt;&gt; HOLD ON A SEC.

00:07:21.292 --> 00:07:22.459
JUST WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING TO DO

00:07:22.459 --> 00:07:24.361
ONCE YOU FIND OUT?

00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:25.763
LET’S SAY YOU DO LEARN WHO

00:07:25.763 --> 00:07:26.998
THE HEAD OF THE DOLLARS IS.

00:07:26.998 --> 00:07:28.033
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO

00:07:28.033 --> 00:07:29.034
AFTER THAT, SIT DOWN

00:07:29.034 --> 00:07:30.068
AND HAVE A CUP OF TEA WITH HIM?

00:07:30.068 --> 00:07:31.069
OR ARE YOU GONNA GET

00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:32.404
THE YELLOW SCARVES TOGETHER

00:07:32.404 --> 00:07:33.839
AND AMBUSH HIM?

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:35.307
&gt;&gt; ALL I WANT IS TO KNOW

00:07:35.307 --> 00:07:36.875
WHO THE SLASHER IS.

00:07:36.875 --> 00:07:38.077
&gt;&gt; AND THE REST OF YOUR GUYS?

00:07:38.077 --> 00:07:39.979
THEY ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THAT?

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:40.914
&gt;&gt; [gasps]

00:07:40.914 --> 00:07:41.915
&gt;&gt; IF YOU HAD A FIRM HAND ON ’EM

00:07:41.915 --> 00:07:42.916
LIKE YOU ONCE DID,

00:07:42.916 --> 00:07:43.983
THEN MAYBE I’D FEEL LIKE

00:07:43.983 --> 00:07:44.984
I COULD HELP YOU OUT

00:07:44.984 --> 00:07:46.886
AND TRUST YOU A BIT.

00:07:46.886 --> 00:07:47.987
BUT SINCE YOU’VE LEFT,

00:07:47.987 --> 00:07:48.988
THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

00:07:48.988 --> 00:07:50.290
YOUR GUYS DON’T ACT THE SAME WAY

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:51.926
THEY ONCE DID.

00:07:51.926 --> 00:07:52.927
DON’T TELL ME YOU HAVEN’T

00:07:52.927 --> 00:07:54.895
NOTICED THIS.

00:07:54.895 --> 00:07:56.130
&gt;&gt; THEY’RE FINE.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.332
I KNOW THOSE GUYS WELL.

00:07:57.332 --> 00:07:58.399
AND NO MATTER WHAT,

00:07:58.399 --> 00:07:59.400
I STILL THINK OF THEM

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.870
AS MY FRIENDS.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.238
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO

00:08:03.238 --> 00:08:04.906
GO ABOUT THIS, DO YOU?

00:08:06.975 --> 00:08:08.244
LET’S SAY FOR A SECOND THAT

00:08:08.244 --> 00:08:09.778
THE DOLLARS ARE INVOLVED.

00:08:09.778 --> 00:08:11.080
WHAT’S THAT GOT TO DO WITH YOU?

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.148
ARE YOU EVEN A PART OF THIS

00:08:12.148 --> 00:08:13.215
ANYMORE?

00:08:13.215 --> 00:08:15.317
YOU ALWAYS HATED GANG WARS.

00:08:15.317 --> 00:08:16.819
THAT’S WHY YOU RAN AWAY BEFORE.

00:08:16.819 --> 00:08:17.820
&gt;&gt; I KNOW.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:18.888
&gt;&gt; BUT SOMETIMES,

00:08:18.888 --> 00:08:20.056
THE REALITY YOU THOUGHT YOU’D

00:08:20.056 --> 00:08:21.558
GOTTEN RID OF COMES BACK

00:08:21.558 --> 00:08:23.126
IN A VERY TWISTED WAY.

00:08:23.126 --> 00:08:24.361
&gt;&gt; BUT THIS TIME, IT DOESN’T

00:08:24.361 --> 00:08:25.362
JUST INVOLVE MY FRIENDS

00:08:25.362 --> 00:08:26.897
IN THE YELLOW SCARVES.

00:08:26.897 --> 00:08:27.898
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:08:27.898 --> 00:08:29.099
&gt;&gt; SOMEONE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME,

00:08:29.099 --> 00:08:30.100
WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.102
WITH MY PAST

00:08:31.102 --> 00:08:32.103
OR THE YELLOW SCARVES,

00:08:32.103 --> 00:08:33.104
WAS ATTACKED.

00:08:33.104 --> 00:08:34.105
AND I WON’T FORGIVE THAT.

00:08:34.105 --> 00:08:35.106
&gt;&gt; WELL, IT SOUNDS TO ME

00:08:35.106 --> 00:08:36.107
LIKE THAT’S YOUR--

00:08:36.107 --> 00:08:37.476
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I KNOW.

00:08:37.476 --> 00:08:39.811
THAT’S MY PROBLEM.

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:41.380
JUST USING THE YELLOW SCARVES

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.881
AS AN EXCUSE.

00:08:42.881 --> 00:08:43.883
A WAY TO WORK THROUGH

00:08:43.883 --> 00:08:46.986
MY OWN ISSUES.

00:08:46.986 --> 00:08:48.521
&gt;&gt; WELL, IF YOU FIGURED THAT

00:08:48.521 --> 00:08:50.590
OUT, THEN I’LL LEAVE YOU ALONE.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:51.991
GUESS THE REMAINING DECISIONS

00:08:51.991 --> 00:08:52.993
WILL BE MADE BY THE GUY

00:08:52.993 --> 00:08:53.994
WHO KNOWS THE LEADER

00:08:53.994 --> 00:08:55.161
AND THE LEADER HIMSELF.

00:08:55.161 --> 00:08:56.162
&gt;&gt; [gasps]

00:08:56.162 --> 00:08:58.364
&gt;&gt; HOWEVER...

00:08:58.364 --> 00:08:59.866
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND

00:08:59.866 --> 00:09:00.934
AND DECIDE THAT THE DOLLARS

00:09:00.934 --> 00:09:03.370
ACTUALLY ARE YOUR ENEMY--

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:04.906
&gt;&gt; IF I WERE TO DO THAT,

00:09:04.906 --> 00:09:06.107
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?

00:09:06.107 --> 00:09:07.308
&gt;&gt; IF YOU GUYS WANT A FIGHT,

00:09:07.308 --> 00:09:09.243
YOU’LL GET ONE.

00:09:09.243 --> 00:09:11.579
YOU’RE PREPARED FOR THAT, RIGHT?

00:09:11.579 --> 00:09:12.847
’CAUSE IF YOU KEEP ON WAVING

00:09:12.847 --> 00:09:14.316
THIS FLAG OF VENGEANCE,

00:09:14.316 --> 00:09:15.617
JUST KNOW THAT THE BATTLES

00:09:15.617 --> 00:09:16.952
YOU’RE GONNA ENCOUNTER WILL BE

00:09:16.952 --> 00:09:18.353
WAY WORSE THAN THE LITTLE KIDDY

00:09:18.353 --> 00:09:22.558
FIGHTS YOU’VE SEEN BEFORE.

00:09:22.558 --> 00:09:25.394
&gt;&gt; IF THAT’S WHAT I--OH!

00:09:25.394 --> 00:09:26.395
[both gasp]

00:09:26.395 --> 00:09:31.034
&gt;&gt; all: UH--

00:09:31.034 --> 00:09:33.470
&gt;&gt; YOU’RE SCARING THE CUSTOMERS.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.572
TAKE THAT KINDA TALK OUTSIDE.

00:09:35.572 --> 00:09:36.573
&gt;&gt; HERE YOU GO.

00:09:36.573 --> 00:09:37.975
FIVE KREMLIN NIGIRI

00:09:37.975 --> 00:09:39.343
FOR MR. BOSS MAN.

00:09:39.343 --> 00:09:41.912
YOU FIGHT BECAUSE YOU’RE HUNGRY.

00:09:41.912 --> 00:09:42.913
[all sigh]

00:09:42.913 --> 00:09:43.914
EAT AND BE FULL.

00:09:43.914 --> 00:09:45.416
FULL OF DREAMS!

00:09:45.416 --> 00:09:46.551
A MAN’S STOMACH IS

00:09:46.551 --> 00:09:49.888
THE DREAM-MAKER.

00:09:49.888 --> 00:09:50.889
MM.

00:09:50.889 --> 00:09:52.658
&gt;&gt; UH, TH-THANKS.

00:09:52.658 --> 00:09:54.193
THE FOOD LOOKS GREAT, SIMON.

00:09:54.193 --> 00:09:56.963
&gt;&gt; Y-YEAH, IT LOOKS AWESOME.

00:09:56.963 --> 00:09:57.964
&gt;&gt; HE’S WHACKED!

00:09:57.964 --> 00:09:59.999
THE OWNER’S WHACKED!

00:09:59.999 --> 00:10:01.467
&gt;&gt; HEY, ISN’T THIS WHAT PEOPLE

00:10:01.467 --> 00:10:02.502
WOULD NORMALLY CALL

00:10:02.502 --> 00:10:03.903
"ATTEMPTED MURDER"?

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:05.938
&gt;&gt; [chuckles] I HAD NO IDEA

00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:07.040
A KNIFE COULD GAUGE A WALL

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.575
LIKE THAT.

00:10:08.575 --> 00:10:11.044
[all chewing]

00:10:11.044 --> 00:10:13.581
[all yell]

00:10:13.581 --> 00:10:14.915
&gt;&gt; LATER, KIDA.

00:10:14.915 --> 00:10:16.484
AND LISTEN, DON’T DO ANYTHING

00:10:16.484 --> 00:10:17.685
YOU’RE GONNA REGRET.

00:10:17.685 --> 00:10:18.920
&gt;&gt; MAN, THAT CHEF’S ONE SCARY

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.421
MOTHER.

00:10:20.421 --> 00:10:21.522
A FEW INCHES EITHER WAY,

00:10:21.522 --> 00:10:22.991
AND ONE OF US WASN’T COMING OUT

00:10:22.991 --> 00:10:24.025
OF THERE ALIVE.

00:10:24.025 --> 00:10:25.093
REALLY?

00:10:25.093 --> 00:10:25.994
I THOUGHT THAT GUY WAS PRETTY

00:10:25.994 --> 00:10:27.062
COOL.

00:10:27.062 --> 00:10:28.130
&gt;&gt; ME, TOO!

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.431
I COULD SEE HIM THROWING DOWN

00:10:29.431 --> 00:10:31.000
COMBAT SAMBO STYLE WITH THE LEAD

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.602
OF SOME MANGA WHO’S LIKE A CHEF

00:10:32.602 --> 00:10:33.936
AND IS ALWAYS SAYIN’ PEOPLE

00:10:33.936 --> 00:10:35.338
SHOULDN’T PLAY WITH KNIVES.

00:10:35.338 --> 00:10:36.972
SO IN OUR MINDS,

00:10:36.972 --> 00:10:38.208
THE CHEF BECAME A FORMER

00:10:38.208 --> 00:10:39.275
MARTIAL ARTS INSTRUCTOR

00:10:39.275 --> 00:10:40.643
FOR THE RUSSIAN MILITARY WHO

00:10:40.643 --> 00:10:42.078
ONCE FOUGHT AGAINST THE MAFIA.

00:10:42.078 --> 00:10:43.079
AND NOW...

00:10:43.079 --> 00:10:44.080
THAT EXPLAINS WHY HE’S

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.081
PRETENDING TO BE A SUSHI CHEF!

00:10:45.081 --> 00:10:46.483
IT’S GENIUS!

00:10:46.483 --> 00:10:47.484
&gt;&gt; DUDE, IF HE WERE,

00:10:47.484 --> 00:10:48.485
HE WOULDN’T OPEN A RESTAURANT

00:10:48.485 --> 00:10:51.355
AS OBVIOUS AS RUSSIA SUSHI.

00:10:51.355 --> 00:10:53.324
&gt;&gt; HORADA...HORADA...

00:10:53.324 --> 00:10:54.459
&gt;&gt; HEY, KYOHEI.

00:10:54.459 --> 00:10:55.593
IS THAT SOME KIND OF SPELL

00:10:55.593 --> 00:10:56.594
YOU’RE CASTING?

00:10:56.594 --> 00:10:57.995
&gt;&gt; AND SO DOTACHIN BEGAN

00:10:57.995 --> 00:10:59.731
TO CHANT, "HO RADA RADA!"

00:10:59.731 --> 00:11:00.665
&gt;&gt; IS THAT THE CONTROLLING

00:11:00.665 --> 00:11:01.733
OR THE SERVANT TYPE?

00:11:01.733 --> 00:11:03.736
&gt;&gt; OR MAYBE ELECTRIC-SHOCK TYPE!

00:11:03.736 --> 00:11:05.704
&gt;&gt; [sighs] REMEMBER WHAT

00:11:05.704 --> 00:11:07.205
MASAOMI SAID?

00:11:07.205 --> 00:11:08.407
I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

00:11:08.407 --> 00:11:09.408
LOOK INTO THE DOLLARS

00:11:09.408 --> 00:11:10.509
ALL YOU WANT, BUT YOU WON’T

00:11:10.509 --> 00:11:12.478
FIND THE SLASHER AMONG US.

00:11:12.478 --> 00:11:13.713
&gt;&gt; I’M SORRY...

00:11:13.713 --> 00:11:16.215
BUT I DISAGREE WITH YOU ON THIS.

00:11:16.215 --> 00:11:17.984
&gt;&gt; HOW COME?

00:11:17.984 --> 00:11:19.018
&gt;&gt; THERE’S A RUMOR THAT THE

00:11:19.018 --> 00:11:21.088
BLACK RIDER’S IN THE DOLLARS.

00:11:21.088 --> 00:11:22.456
&gt;&gt; HUH? WHY ARE WE TALKIN’

00:11:22.456 --> 00:11:24.124
ABOUT THE BLACK RIDER?

00:11:24.124 --> 00:11:25.560
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE LAST NIGHT,

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.663
WE SAW SOMETHING PRETTY UNREAL.

00:11:28.663 --> 00:11:29.597
&gt;&gt; I SEE.

00:11:29.597 --> 00:11:31.099
SO BECAUSE THE BLACK RIDER

00:11:31.099 --> 00:11:32.100
HELPED SOMEONE WITH

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.501
A KATANA ESCAPE, THEY’RE WORKIN’

00:11:33.501 --> 00:11:35.036
WITH THE SLASHER?

00:11:35.036 --> 00:11:37.172
&gt;&gt; AND THIS GUY HORADA SAID

00:11:37.172 --> 00:11:38.173
HE WAS ATTACKED BY THE BLACK

00:11:38.173 --> 00:11:39.174
BLACK RIDER.

00:11:39.174 --> 00:11:41.643
&gt;&gt; HORADA?

00:11:41.643 --> 00:11:43.612
HORADA.

00:11:43.612 --> 00:11:44.613
&gt;&gt; SO THAT’S WHY YOU’RE

00:11:44.613 --> 00:11:46.182
MUMBLING THAT NAME.

00:11:46.182 --> 00:11:47.183
&gt;&gt; WHAT’S THE BIG DEAL

00:11:47.183 --> 00:11:49.519
ABOUT THIS HORADA GUY, ANYWAY?

00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:50.287
&gt;&gt; I DON’T KNOW.

00:11:50.287 --> 00:11:51.554
IT MIGHT BE NOTHING.

00:11:51.554 --> 00:11:53.256
BUT IF I’M RIGHT, IT MIGHT BE

00:11:53.256 --> 00:11:55.058
SOMETHING.

00:11:55.058 --> 00:11:56.559
&gt;&gt; RIGHT ABOUT WHAT?

00:11:56.559 --> 00:11:58.496
&gt;&gt; WELL, I’M NOT ENTIRELY

00:11:58.496 --> 00:12:00.498
POSITIVE, BUT I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN

00:12:00.498 --> 00:12:02.233
A GUY WITH THAT NAME ONCE.

00:12:04.568 --> 00:12:06.170
&gt;&gt; IF YOU PUT IT TOGETHER...

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:07.171
THAT THERE’S A GROUP WITHIN

00:12:07.171 --> 00:12:08.072
THE DOLLARS WORKING WITH

00:12:08.072 --> 00:12:09.207
THE BLACK RIDER TO TARGET

00:12:09.207 --> 00:12:10.442
THE YELLOW SCARVES,

00:12:10.442 --> 00:12:11.810
THEN IT ALL ADDS UP.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:12.811
&gt;&gt; HEY, YUMATCH.

00:12:12.811 --> 00:12:13.812
ISN’T THERE SOMETHING WRONG

00:12:13.812 --> 00:12:14.813
WITH THIS THEORY?

00:12:14.813 --> 00:12:16.281
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:12:16.281 --> 00:12:17.482
&gt;&gt; THE BLACK RIDER TOOK OUT

00:12:17.482 --> 00:12:18.150
THE SLASHER.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:19.819
WE SAW IT WITH OUR OWN EYES.

00:12:19.819 --> 00:12:20.820
&gt;&gt; YEAH, SABURO EVEN SMASHED

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:21.821
INTO HIM.

00:12:21.821 --> 00:12:23.323
&gt;&gt; AND THEN SHIZU-CHAN PUMMELED

00:12:23.323 --> 00:12:24.357
HIM WITH THE DOOR.

00:12:24.357 --> 00:12:25.558
&gt;&gt; THEN AGAIN, THAT WAS

00:12:25.558 --> 00:12:27.160
THE NIGHT 50 OTHER PEOPLE

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.562
GOT SLASHED.

00:12:28.562 --> 00:12:29.830
MAYBE IT’S ONE OF THEM!

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:31.131
&gt;&gt; Kyohei: EITHER WAY, WE’VE

00:12:31.131 --> 00:12:32.566
SEEN THE LAST OF THE SLASHER.

00:12:32.566 --> 00:12:33.567
&gt;&gt; OH?

00:12:33.567 --> 00:12:34.635
&gt;&gt; I HEARD THOSE GUYS PICKED

00:12:34.635 --> 00:12:37.204
A FIGHT WITH SHIZUO HEIWAJIMA.

00:12:37.204 --> 00:12:39.073
AND YOU KNOW HOW THAT GOES.

00:12:39.073 --> 00:12:40.374
&gt;&gt; [sighs] YEAH, BUT--

00:12:40.374 --> 00:12:41.376
&gt;&gt; I’M GIVING YOU

00:12:41.376 --> 00:12:42.377
THE PHONE NUMBER FOR THE GUY

00:12:42.377 --> 00:12:43.378
WHO CAN TELL YOU

00:12:43.378 --> 00:12:44.379
WHO OUR BOSS IS.

00:12:44.379 --> 00:12:45.380
&gt;&gt; [gasps]

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:49.585
&gt;&gt; DO WHAT YOU WANT WITH IT.

00:12:49.585 --> 00:12:50.619
&gt;&gt; [gasps]

00:12:56.392 --> 00:12:57.393
&gt;&gt; SAD FACES SCARE AWAY

00:12:57.393 --> 00:12:58.828
CUSTOMERS.

00:12:58.828 --> 00:13:00.196
I WANT YOU TO EAT THAT,

00:13:00.196 --> 00:13:01.197
AND THEN WALK OUTTA HERE

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:02.198
SMILING.

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:03.667
&gt;&gt; [gasps] THIS IS GREAT.

00:13:03.667 --> 00:13:04.668
THANKS.

00:13:04.668 --> 00:13:06.503
&gt;&gt; FIGHTING ALWAYS BAD.

00:13:06.503 --> 00:13:08.138
YOU BE PLENTY ENOUGH HAPPY

00:13:08.138 --> 00:13:09.406
AS YOU ARE RIGHT NOW.

00:13:09.406 --> 00:13:10.407
DON’T TAKE AWAY

00:13:10.407 --> 00:13:12.209
OTHER PEOPLE’S HAPPINESS.

00:13:12.209 --> 00:13:14.345
SHARE THE HAPPINESS.

00:13:14.345 --> 00:13:16.147
LISTEN, THIS I LEARN.

00:13:16.147 --> 00:13:17.582
"THE MERCILESS ARE NOTHING MORE

00:13:17.582 --> 00:13:19.217
THAN FAILED CATFISH."

00:13:19.217 --> 00:13:20.218
YOU TELL ME WHAT IT MEANS?

00:13:20.218 --> 00:13:21.753
&gt;&gt; "MERCY BENEFITS ALL,"

00:13:21.753 --> 00:13:22.788
YOU MEAN.

00:13:22.788 --> 00:13:24.656
&gt;&gt; YOU A CATFISH, YOUNG KIDA?

00:13:24.656 --> 00:13:26.225
THAT IT? ARE YOU?

00:13:26.225 --> 00:13:29.261
&gt;&gt; THIS IS GOOD, THANK YOU.

00:13:29.261 --> 00:13:30.763
&gt;&gt; SO BORED.

00:13:30.763 --> 00:13:32.264
WHO KNEW HAVING NOTHING TO DO

00:13:32.264 --> 00:13:35.167
WOULD BE SO INCREDIBLY TEDIOUS?

00:13:35.167 --> 00:13:36.569
&gt;&gt; CAN I HIT YOU?

00:13:36.569 --> 00:13:37.870
&gt;&gt; OH, RELAX.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:40.640
I <i>AM</i> PAYING YOU, AFTER ALL.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.842
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS THIS CHOCOLATE THING

00:13:41.842 --> 00:13:43.911
THAT YOU SENT TO THE AWAKUSU?

00:13:43.911 --> 00:13:45.679
&gt;&gt; IT WAS A HANDGUN, WHY?

00:13:45.679 --> 00:13:47.681
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:13:47.681 --> 00:13:48.682
&gt;&gt; I’M SURE YOU HEARD

00:13:48.682 --> 00:13:49.683
ABOUT THIS.

00:13:49.683 --> 00:13:51.686
SIX MONTHS AGO, SOMEONE RAN OFF

00:13:51.686 --> 00:13:52.687
WITH A BUNCH OF HANDGUNS

00:13:52.687 --> 00:13:54.322
FROM THE AWAKUSU GROUP.

00:13:54.322 --> 00:13:55.324
&gt;&gt; OH, RIGHT.

00:13:55.324 --> 00:13:56.825
THE GUY THAT NASTY DULLAHAN

00:13:56.825 --> 00:13:58.360
WAS CHASING.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.428
&gt;&gt; THAT’S RIGHT.

00:13:59.428 --> 00:14:00.863
CELTY WAS ABLE TO TRACK DOWN

00:14:00.863 --> 00:14:02.264
MOST OF THEM BEFORE THEY COULD

00:14:02.264 --> 00:14:03.766
CAUSE ANY KIND OF PROBLEM.

00:14:03.766 --> 00:14:04.767
BUT THERE’S STILL ONE

00:14:04.767 --> 00:14:06.436
UNACCOUNTED FOR.

00:14:06.436 --> 00:14:07.937
THAT’S WHY--

00:14:07.937 --> 00:14:11.307
[cell phone ringing]

00:14:11.307 --> 00:14:13.176
WELL, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE

00:14:13.176 --> 00:14:14.878
CALLING ME SOON.

00:14:14.878 --> 00:14:15.779
&gt;&gt; THAT’S BULLSHIT.

00:14:15.779 --> 00:14:17.548
&gt;&gt; YES, OF COURSE.

00:14:17.548 --> 00:14:18.615
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:14:18.615 --> 00:14:20.484
I’LL BE RIGHT THERE.

00:14:20.484 --> 00:14:21.552
&gt;&gt; IN THE END, HE WAS THE ONLY

00:14:21.552 --> 00:14:23.254
ONE WHO COULDN’T RUN FROM HIS

00:14:23.254 --> 00:14:23.688
PAST.

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:31.263
&gt;&gt; A GREAT MAN ONCE SAID,

00:14:31.263 --> 00:14:32.831
"THE WORLD IS SYMBOLIC."

00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:34.466
AT LEAST, I THINK HE SAID IT.

00:14:34.466 --> 00:14:35.734
EVEN IF HE DIDN’T, I’M SURE

00:14:35.734 --> 00:14:36.835
SOMEONE ELSE SAID SOMETHING

00:14:36.835 --> 00:14:38.671
PRETTY CLOSE TO THAT.

00:14:38.671 --> 00:14:40.273
&gt;&gt; IT’S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE

00:14:40.273 --> 00:14:41.807
I’VE SEEN YOU MAKE THAT FACE.

00:14:41.807 --> 00:14:42.809
YOU WERE JUST

00:14:42.809 --> 00:14:44.277
A MIDDLE-SCHOOL KID,

00:14:44.277 --> 00:14:45.278
BUT YOUR EXPRESSION WAS

00:14:45.278 --> 00:14:46.680
ALL ADULT.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.681
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH WITH

00:14:47.681 --> 00:14:48.782
THE REMINISCING.

00:14:48.782 --> 00:14:49.816
IT’S TIME THAT I GAVE YOU

00:14:49.816 --> 00:14:52.552
A PROPER GREETING.

00:14:52.552 --> 00:14:53.620
WELCOME BACK.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.722
&gt;&gt; [clicks tongue angrily]

00:14:54.722 --> 00:14:55.723
&gt;&gt; I THINK I KNOW WHAT

00:14:55.723 --> 00:14:57.357
YOU WANNA ASK.

00:14:57.357 --> 00:14:58.459
I SUPPOSE I COULD HAVE ANSWERED

00:14:58.459 --> 00:14:59.894
YOUR QUESTION OVER THE PHONE,

00:14:59.894 --> 00:15:02.263
BUT THAT SEEMED INAPPROPRIATE

00:15:02.263 --> 00:15:04.800
DUE TO HOW SERIOUS THIS IS.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.234
I HEARD A FRIEND OF YOURS

00:15:06.234 --> 00:15:07.435
GOT SLASHED.

00:15:07.435 --> 00:15:08.470
I BELIEVE HER NAME IS

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:11.473
ANRI SONOHARA, ISN’T THAT RIGHT?

00:15:11.473 --> 00:15:13.375
AND FROM THE LOOKS OF IT, I’D

00:15:13.375 --> 00:15:14.610
SAY THAT SHE’S MORE IMPORTANT

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:15.611
TO YOU THAN THOSE KIDS

00:15:15.611 --> 00:15:16.979
IN THE YELLOW SCARVES ARE.

00:15:16.979 --> 00:15:17.980
&gt;&gt; ONCE UPON A TIME, A YOUNG

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.550
BOY, HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY MANGA

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:21.551
AND TV SHOWS, CREATED A GANG

00:15:21.551 --> 00:15:23.753
CALLED THE YELLOW SCARVES.

00:15:23.753 --> 00:15:24.821
&gt;&gt; THE YELLOW SCARVES FOUGHT

00:15:24.821 --> 00:15:25.889
ANOTHER GANG WHO USED BLUE AS

00:15:25.889 --> 00:15:28.659
THEIR DISTINGUISHING COLOR.

00:15:28.659 --> 00:15:29.660
AND SOON BOTH SIDES WERE

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.662
IN GRAVE PERIL.

00:15:31.662 --> 00:15:32.663
&gt;&gt; THEN, A BRILLIANT STRATEGIST

00:15:32.663 --> 00:15:33.664
CAME ON THE SCENE.

00:15:33.664 --> 00:15:34.665
&gt;&gt; WHY ARE YOUR CHARACTERS

00:15:34.665 --> 00:15:35.900
ALWAYS CUTE GIRLS?

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:36.901
&gt;&gt; BUT HE WASN’T REALLY

00:15:36.901 --> 00:15:38.302
A BRILLIANT STRATEGIST--

00:15:38.302 --> 00:15:39.671
MORE LIKE A CUNNING DICTATOR.

00:15:39.671 --> 00:15:40.672
&gt;&gt; AND THEN THE OTHER GROUP,

00:15:40.672 --> 00:15:41.673
NOW IN DANGER ITSELF,

00:15:41.673 --> 00:15:42.674
KIDNAPPED THE YOUNG BOY’S

00:15:42.674 --> 00:15:43.675
PRINCESS.

00:15:43.675 --> 00:15:44.676
THE BOY TRIED TO SAVE HER,

00:15:44.676 --> 00:15:45.677
BUT BEFORE HE COULD

00:15:45.677 --> 00:15:47.579
SAVE THE DAY, HE WAS OVERWHELMED

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:49.615
BY FEAR AND--

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:50.650
&gt;&gt; NOW, LET’S SUPPOSE THIS GIRL

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:51.651
YOU LIKE WAS CAUGHT IN A

00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:53.386
YELLOW SCARVES GANG WAR,

00:15:53.386 --> 00:15:55.621
AND, AS A RESULT, BADLY HURT.

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:57.523
YES, YES, THAT WOULD BE BAD.

00:15:57.523 --> 00:15:58.524
IT WOULD BE LIKE THAT INCIDENT

00:15:58.524 --> 00:16:00.694
WITH SAKI ALL OVER AGAIN.

00:16:00.694 --> 00:16:01.762
LET ME GUESS WHAT

00:16:01.762 --> 00:16:03.964
YOU’RE THINKING RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

00:16:03.964 --> 00:16:04.998
I BET IT’S SOMETHING LIKE,

00:16:04.998 --> 00:16:07.334
"I THOUGHT I TRULY LOVED SAKI.

00:16:07.334 --> 00:16:08.402
BUT IN THE END, I WAS MORE

00:16:08.402 --> 00:16:09.536
AFRAID FOR MY OWN LIFE

00:16:09.536 --> 00:16:10.538
THAN FOR HERS."

00:16:10.538 --> 00:16:12.039
SO MAYBE IT WASN’T TRUE LOVE

00:16:12.039 --> 00:16:13.040
AFTER ALL.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.041
MAYBE YOU WERE JUST

00:16:14.041 --> 00:16:15.643
AFTER HER BODY.

00:16:15.643 --> 00:16:17.312
WHICH, IN RETURN, MEANS,

00:16:17.312 --> 00:16:18.546
MAYBE YOU DIDN’T LOVE HER NEARLY

00:16:18.546 --> 00:16:20.549
AS MUCH AS YOU THOUGHT YOU DID.

00:16:20.549 --> 00:16:21.617
IS THAT IT?

00:16:21.617 --> 00:16:22.618
&gt;&gt; GOOD LORD.

00:16:22.618 --> 00:16:23.886
DOES HE EVER STOP?

00:16:23.886 --> 00:16:25.488
&gt;&gt; SO NOW YOU’VE BEGUN TO HOPE

00:16:25.488 --> 00:16:26.822
NOT TRULY LOVING HER IS INDEED

00:16:26.822 --> 00:16:28.657
WHAT CAUSED YOUR INACTION.

00:16:28.657 --> 00:16:30.694
BECAUSE IF YOU DID LOVE A GIRL,

00:16:30.694 --> 00:16:31.961
YOU’D HAVE NO PROBLEM RISKING

00:16:31.961 --> 00:16:33.730
YOUR LIFE TO SAVE HER.

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:35.699
AND IF THAT’S TRUE,

00:16:35.699 --> 00:16:37.968
ANRI WILL BE YOUR LITMUS TEST.

00:16:37.968 --> 00:16:39.003
&gt;&gt; IF THAT’S WHY YOU THINK

00:16:39.003 --> 00:16:40.838
I’M DOING THIS, FINE.

00:16:40.838 --> 00:16:41.906
&gt;&gt; [sighs]

00:16:41.906 --> 00:16:43.674
&gt;&gt; I JUST WANNA SETTLE THIS

00:16:43.674 --> 00:16:44.809
SCORE PERSONALLY.

00:16:44.809 --> 00:16:46.611
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU REFERRING TO?

00:16:46.611 --> 00:16:48.013
TAKING OUT THE SLASHER?

00:16:48.013 --> 00:16:49.747
OR DESTROYING THE DOLLARS?

00:16:49.747 --> 00:16:50.749
&gt;&gt; DEPENDING ON WHAT

00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:52.751
YOU TELL ME, IT MIGHT BE BOTH.

00:16:52.751 --> 00:16:54.786
&gt;&gt; NOW, THAT’S THE SPIRIT!

00:16:54.786 --> 00:16:56.522
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

00:16:56.522 --> 00:16:57.523
LET’S GIVE YOU SOMETHING

00:16:57.523 --> 00:16:58.590
TO MOVE ON.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:00.059
I’LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

00:17:00.059 --> 00:17:01.894
THE SIMPLE, COLD, HARD FACTS.

00:17:01.894 --> 00:17:03.496
THE REALITY, ALL LAID OUT,

00:17:03.496 --> 00:17:04.497
STRAIGHTFORWARD AND PLAIN AS

00:17:04.497 --> 00:17:06.032
DAY.

00:17:06.032 --> 00:17:07.033
THE THREE ARE USUALLY

00:17:07.033 --> 00:17:08.501
QUITE DIFFERENT,

00:17:08.501 --> 00:17:09.536
BUT IN THIS CASE,

00:17:09.536 --> 00:17:10.938
THEY ALL FOLD INTO ONE.

00:17:10.938 --> 00:17:11.939
&gt;&gt; [gasps]

00:17:11.939 --> 00:17:12.940
&gt;&gt; BY THE WAY,

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:14.041
HOW’S YOUR FRIEND MIKADO?

00:17:14.041 --> 00:17:15.042
&gt;&gt; WHA--?

00:17:15.042 --> 00:17:16.143
&gt;&gt; [chuckles] REMEMBER?

00:17:16.143 --> 00:17:17.378
WE BUMPED INTO EACH OTHER,

00:17:17.378 --> 00:17:18.746
AND YOU INTRODUCED US.

00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:20.581
IT WAS EARLIER IN THE YEAR.

00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:22.784
MIKADO RYUGAMINE, RIGHT?

00:17:22.784 --> 00:17:23.985
&gt;&gt; I REMEMBER, BUT WHY ARE YOU

00:17:23.985 --> 00:17:25.854
MENTIONING HIM NOW?

00:17:25.854 --> 00:17:26.888
&gt;&gt; I FIGURED, WITH HIM BEING

00:17:26.888 --> 00:17:28.423
SUCH A GOOD FRIEND OF YOURS,

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:29.424
HE’D BE CONCERNED ABOUT

00:17:29.424 --> 00:17:30.725
YOUR SITUATION.

00:17:30.725 --> 00:17:31.726
&gt;&gt; HE HAS NOTHING TO DO

00:17:31.726 --> 00:17:33.062
WITH THIS!

00:17:33.062 --> 00:17:34.063
I HAVEN’T TOLD HIM

00:17:34.063 --> 00:17:35.097
ABOUT THE YELLOW SCARVES,

00:17:35.097 --> 00:17:36.098
AND I WON’T.

00:17:36.098 --> 00:17:37.099
HE’S STILL THE SAME.

00:17:37.099 --> 00:17:39.569
A LITTLE NA VE BUT DOING OKAY.

00:17:39.569 --> 00:17:40.770
LIVING EVERY DAY LIKE

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:42.638
IT’S THE BEST DAY EVER.

00:17:42.638 --> 00:17:44.174
&gt;&gt; AH, DO I DETECT A LITTLE BIT

00:17:44.174 --> 00:17:45.642
OF JEALOUSY IN YOUR VOICE?

00:17:45.642 --> 00:17:46.743
THAT THE LIFE YOU WANT?

00:17:46.743 --> 00:17:47.744
&gt;&gt; I TOLD YOU THIS HAS NOTHING

00:17:47.744 --> 00:17:48.979
TO DO WITH HIM!

00:17:48.979 --> 00:17:50.614
&gt;&gt; AH, BUT WHAT IF IT DID?

00:17:50.614 --> 00:17:52.049
&gt;&gt; [gasps] HUH?

00:17:52.049 --> 00:17:53.751
&gt;&gt; ISN’T THAT PERFECT?

00:17:53.751 --> 00:17:55.720
MIKADO IS DOING SO WELL.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.721
YOU’RE HERE,

00:17:56.721 --> 00:17:57.722
COMPLETELY MISERABLE,

00:17:57.722 --> 00:17:58.723
AND HE’S ENJOYING EVERY SINGLE

00:17:58.723 --> 00:17:59.824
DAY.

00:17:59.824 --> 00:18:00.892
AND YET HE’S THE ONE WHO’S

00:18:00.892 --> 00:18:02.660
CAUSING YOU MISERY.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:03.762
&gt;&gt; WAIT A SEC!

00:18:03.762 --> 00:18:05.163
JUST WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY

00:18:05.163 --> 00:18:06.765
"HE’S THE CAUSE"?

00:18:06.765 --> 00:18:08.667
&gt;&gt; DO I NEED TO SPELL IT OUT?

00:18:08.667 --> 00:18:09.735
THE HEAD OF THE DOLLARS IS

00:18:09.735 --> 00:18:11.570
YOUR OLDEST AND DEAREST FRIEND,

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.672
MIKADO RYUGAMINE.

00:18:13.672 --> 00:18:14.908
ALTHOUGH YOU MIGHT BE

00:18:14.908 --> 00:18:16.042
THE ONLY ONE WHO CONSIDERS

00:18:16.042 --> 00:18:16.876
YOURSELF FRIENDS IN THAT--

00:18:16.876 --> 00:18:18.712
&gt;&gt; REALITY IS SUCH A PAIN.

00:18:18.712 --> 00:18:20.447
AND FOR THOSE OF US WHO GET FED

00:18:20.447 --> 00:18:21.848
UP WITH THAT KIND OF REALITY,

00:18:21.848 --> 00:18:22.882
WE SIMPLY CHOOSE TO MAKE A NEW

00:18:22.882 --> 00:18:24.051
ONE.

00:18:24.051 --> 00:18:25.185
WE CREATE LITTLE WALLS

00:18:25.185 --> 00:18:26.486
AND SEPARATE THE TRASH

00:18:26.486 --> 00:18:27.722
FROM THE STUFF WE LIKE.

00:18:27.722 --> 00:18:28.756
AND WHEN THAT’S ALL DONE,

00:18:28.756 --> 00:18:30.658
WE KEEP THE THINGS WE CARE ABOUT

00:18:30.658 --> 00:18:32.093
AND KICK THE REST TO THE CURB.

00:18:32.093 --> 00:18:33.761
YOU’D BE AMAZED HOW WELL IT

00:18:33.761 --> 00:18:34.863
WORKS!

00:18:34.863 --> 00:18:36.564
A WHOLE WORLD MADE OUT OF JUST

00:18:36.564 --> 00:18:37.966
MO-EH, TSOON-DEH-REH, AND BL!

00:18:37.966 --> 00:18:38.967
IT’S THE BEST DISCOVERY EVER!

00:18:38.967 --> 00:18:40.569
OH, COOL.

00:18:40.569 --> 00:18:41.637
IF YOU ASK ME,

00:18:41.637 --> 00:18:42.771
THAT REALLY IS THE BEST WAY

00:18:42.771 --> 00:18:43.939
TO SEPARATE REALITY FROM

00:18:43.939 --> 00:18:45.875
FICTION.

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:47.143
&gt;&gt; YOU GUYS HEAR?

00:18:47.143 --> 00:18:48.811
THE DOLLARS AND YELLOW SCARVES

00:18:48.811 --> 00:18:49.846
WENT AT IT AGAIN.

00:18:49.846 --> 00:18:51.047
&gt;&gt; MAN, AGAIN?

00:18:51.047 --> 00:18:52.048
&gt;&gt; SCARY.

00:18:52.048 --> 00:18:53.583
&gt;&gt; IT WAS JUST ANOTHER SCUFFLE,

00:18:53.583 --> 00:18:54.051
RIGHT?

00:18:54.051 --> 00:18:55.052
&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY, THIS TIME THE

00:18:55.052 --> 00:18:56.754
DOLLARS HIT THE YELLOW SCARVES

00:18:56.754 --> 00:18:58.221
AT THEIR OWN HQ.

00:18:58.221 --> 00:18:59.857
&gt;&gt; THAT’S BOLD.

00:18:59.857 --> 00:19:00.858
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:19:00.858 --> 00:19:02.493
YOU KNOW THAT HEADLESS RIDER?

00:19:02.493 --> 00:19:03.527
THEY’RE SAYIN’ IT TEAMED UP

00:19:03.527 --> 00:19:04.562
WITH THE SLASHER.

00:19:04.562 --> 00:19:05.629
AND TOGETHER, THEY ATTACKED

00:19:05.629 --> 00:19:08.132
THIS SECRET HIDEOUT THEY HAVE.

00:19:08.132 --> 00:19:08.933
&gt;&gt; UH--

00:19:08.933 --> 00:19:10.569
&gt;&gt; HEY, SETTON, IS SOMETHING

00:19:10.569 --> 00:19:11.035
WRONG?

00:19:11.035 --> 00:19:12.771
&gt;&gt; THAT CAN’T BE TRUE.

00:19:12.771 --> 00:19:13.772
I DON’T BELIEVE THAT.

00:19:13.772 --> 00:19:15.207
EVEN FROM YOU, KANRA.

00:19:15.207 --> 00:19:17.076
THAT’S WAY TOO ABSURD.

00:19:17.076 --> 00:19:18.077
[electronic chime]

00:19:18.077 --> 00:19:19.078
&gt;&gt; HI, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS

00:19:19.078 --> 00:19:20.079
TALKING ABOUT?

00:19:20.079 --> 00:19:21.080
&gt;&gt; JUST SOME ANIME!

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.081
[laughs]

00:19:22.081 --> 00:19:24.083
&gt;&gt; NO, WE’RE NOT, SETTON.

00:19:24.083 --> 00:19:25.085
&gt;&gt; WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT

00:19:25.085 --> 00:19:26.852
THIS SPECIAL-EFFECTS MOVIE

00:19:26.852 --> 00:19:27.888
COMING OUT.

00:19:27.888 --> 00:19:29.122
&gt;&gt; OH, I SEE.

00:19:29.122 --> 00:19:30.791
&gt;&gt; <i>ET TU,</i> TARO TANAKA?

00:19:30.791 --> 00:19:31.792
&gt;&gt; IT’S SUPPOSED TO BE REALLY

00:19:31.792 --> 00:19:33.026
INTERESTING.

00:19:33.026 --> 00:19:34.027
I HEARD THEY WENT THROUGH

00:19:34.027 --> 00:19:35.196
TWO PRODUCERS WHILE MAKING IT

00:19:35.196 --> 00:19:36.230
AND COMPLETELY REPLACED

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:37.899
ALL THE SCREENWRITERS.

00:19:37.899 --> 00:19:40.301
&gt;&gt; OKAY, I’LL CHECK IT OUT.

00:19:40.301 --> 00:19:42.136
&gt;&gt; BY THE WAY, I HEARD THIS

00:19:42.136 --> 00:19:43.838
CRAZY RUMOR.

00:19:43.838 --> 00:19:44.839
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT?

00:19:44.839 --> 00:19:45.840
&gt;&gt; THEY SAY THE HEAD OF THE

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.874
YELLOW SCARVES WANTS TO MEET

00:19:46.874 --> 00:19:48.276
THE LEADER OF THE DOLLARS AND

00:19:48.276 --> 00:19:49.277
CHALLENGE HIM TO SOME KIND OF

00:19:49.277 --> 00:19:50.779
SHOWDOWN.

00:19:50.779 --> 00:19:51.780
&gt;&gt; [gasps] REALLY?

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:52.781
&gt;&gt; [chuckles]

00:19:52.781 --> 00:19:53.782
&gt;&gt; OH!

00:19:53.782 --> 00:19:55.984
&gt;&gt; [sighs]

00:19:55.984 --> 00:19:57.120
&gt;&gt; HEY, MASAOMI!

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.121

&gt;&gt; WHAT’S UP?

00:19:58.821 --> 00:20:00.123
YOU DIDN’T STOP BY MY CLASS

00:20:00.123 --> 00:20:01.858
BEFORE TAKING OFF TODAY.

00:20:01.858 --> 00:20:03.059
&gt;&gt; YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW.

00:20:03.059 --> 00:20:04.060
&gt;&gt; AND YOU SKIPPED CLASS

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.696
YESTERDAY, TOO.

00:20:06.696 --> 00:20:08.265
&gt;&gt; YOU’RE LOOKIN’ MUCH BETTER.

00:20:08.265 --> 00:20:10.067
&gt;&gt; UM, MASAOMI.

00:20:10.067 --> 00:20:11.301

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.841
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:17.842

&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN’ ABOUT?

00:20:19.577 --> 00:20:20.846
&gt;&gt; GUESS YOU DON’T KNOW.

00:20:20.846 --> 00:20:21.847
THE DOLLARS ARE FIGHTING

00:20:21.847 --> 00:20:23.915
THE YELLOW SCARVES AGAIN.

00:20:23.915 --> 00:20:25.617
AND YESTERDAY, SOMEONE

00:20:25.617 --> 00:20:26.785
WAS ASKING MY CLASSMATES

00:20:26.785 --> 00:20:28.287
ABOUT ME.

00:20:28.287 --> 00:20:31.723
&gt;&gt; I DIDN’T TELL ANYBODY.

00:20:31.723 --> 00:20:32.859
&gt;&gt; ME NEITHER.

00:20:32.859 --> 00:20:34.594
&gt;&gt; OKAY, THANKS. LATER!

00:20:34.594 --> 00:20:35.828

SAME GOES FOR ME.

00:20:38.931 --> 00:20:40.167
&gt;&gt; UH, YOU’RE NOT WALKIN’ HOME

00:20:40.167 --> 00:20:41.168
WITH US?

00:20:41.168 --> 00:20:42.936
&gt;&gt; I GOT THINGS TO DO.

00:20:42.936 --> 00:20:44.237
THERE’S A HORDE OF FEMALE FANS

00:20:44.237 --> 00:20:45.105
WHO REQUIRE MY CONSTANT

00:20:45.105 --> 00:20:45.906
ATTENTION.

00:20:45.906 --> 00:20:47.941
I CAN’T DISAPPOINT ’EM.

00:20:47.941 --> 00:20:50.044
LATES, PEEPS.

00:20:50.044 --> 00:20:52.113
&gt;&gt; MASAOMI.

00:20:52.113 --> 00:20:53.247
&gt;&gt; LISTEN, DO NOT START FIGHTS

00:20:53.247 --> 00:20:54.248
WITH THEM.

00:20:54.248 --> 00:20:56.250
NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO.

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:57.752
&gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT CHIEF--

00:20:57.752 --> 00:20:58.753
&gt;&gt; I DON’T WANNA GIVE ’EM

00:20:58.753 --> 00:21:00.355
ANY REASON TO COME AFTER US.

00:21:00.355 --> 00:21:01.356
IF THE SLASHER IS PART

00:21:01.356 --> 00:21:02.624
OF THE DOLLARS, THEN GET SOME

00:21:02.624 --> 00:21:03.859
PROOF!

00:21:03.859 --> 00:21:04.860
&gt;&gt; HEY, CHIEF.

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:05.995
YOU SAID YOU KNEW SOMEBODY

00:21:05.995 --> 00:21:06.996
WHO COULD TELL YOU THE NAME

00:21:06.996 --> 00:21:07.997
OF THE GUY WHO’S RUNNIN’

00:21:07.997 --> 00:21:08.998
THE DOLLARS.

00:21:08.998 --> 00:21:11.034
ANY LUCK WITH THAT?

00:21:11.034 --> 00:21:12.002
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:21:12.002 --> 00:21:13.003
&gt;&gt; BUT AFTER WHAT HAPPENED

00:21:13.003 --> 00:21:14.738
YESTERDAY, SOME GUYS ARE GETTING

00:21:14.738 --> 00:21:16.640
TIRED OF TAKING THEIR CRAP.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.677
WHAT IF THEY GO FULL TILT ON US?

00:21:20.677 --> 00:21:21.812
&gt;&gt; IF THAT HAPPENS,

00:21:21.812 --> 00:21:23.881
I’LL BE READY FOR IT.

00:21:23.881 --> 00:21:27.619

00:21:49.709 --> 00:21:51.745
THIS IS HAPPENING TO YA?

00:21:51.745 --> 00:21:53.813
IT’S ’CAUSE YOU GOT NO COLOR.

00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:54.814
AND I BET YOU THOUGHT

00:21:54.814 --> 00:21:56.283
THAT MEANT YOU WERE SAFE.

00:21:56.283 --> 00:21:58.152
DOUCHE BAG.

00:21:58.152 --> 00:21:59.286
IN THE REAL WORLD,

00:21:59.286 --> 00:22:00.320
NO ONE WILL COME AND SAVE YOU

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.322
UNLESS YOU’RE FLASHING

00:22:01.322 --> 00:22:02.857

00:22:02.857 --> 00:22:04.025
[scoffs] A GROUP WITH NO CHAIN

00:22:04.025 --> 00:22:05.861

00:22:05.861 --> 00:22:07.095
[inhales deeply]

00:22:07.095 --> 00:22:09.698

00:22:09.698 --> 00:22:12.000
THAT’S BULLSHIT!

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.001
YOU GUYS AIN’T NOTHIN’

00:22:13.001 --> 00:22:14.002
