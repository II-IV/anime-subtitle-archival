00:01:42.056 --> 00:01:43.990
&gt;&gt; EVEN NOW, I STILL DON’T GET

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.425
IT.

00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:48.660
BUT IN A WEIRD WAY...I DUNNO...

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.128
I GUESS I SORT OF DO.

00:01:52.128 --> 00:01:54.330
ANYWAY, ONE THING’S FOR SURE.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.096
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT

00:01:55.096 --> 00:01:58.132
CHANGED MY LIFE.

00:01:58.132 --> 00:02:00.733
BUT THEN AGAIN, NOTHING REALLY

00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:03.334
CHANGED AT ALL.

00:02:03.334 --> 00:02:05.802
YEAH, IT WAS REALLY WEIRD,

00:02:05.802 --> 00:02:07.237
THE KIND OF WEIRD THAT COULD

00:02:07.237 --> 00:02:08.870
HAPPEN TO ANYONE WHEN YOU THINK

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.738
ABOUT IT.

00:02:10.738 --> 00:02:12.372
AND IT HAPPENED HERE

00:02:12.372 --> 00:02:17.808
IN IKEBUKURO.

00:02:17.808 --> 00:02:22.211
OHH. HMM.

00:02:22.211 --> 00:02:23.778
AH! I’M SO SORRY!

00:02:23.778 --> 00:02:25.421
I DIDN’T MEAN...TO...

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.416
I WANNA GO HOME.

00:02:32.416 --> 00:02:34.351
DON’T LAUGH, BUT I NEVER DID

00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:35.818
THE FIELD TRIP THING DURING

00:02:35.818 --> 00:02:36.785
ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE SCHOOL.

00:02:36.785 --> 00:02:37.853
&gt;&gt; SEE YA!

00:02:37.853 --> 00:02:39.787
&gt;&gt; I’VE NEVER LEFT MY HOMETOWN.

00:02:39.787 --> 00:02:41.421
I’M 15, AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:43.322
THIS IS MY FIRST TRIP TO TOKYO.

00:02:43.322 --> 00:02:46.391
THAT’S ME, MIKADO RYUGAMINE.

00:02:46.391 --> 00:02:47.958
[sighs]

00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.192
SO WHY AM I STANDING HERE

00:02:49.192 --> 00:02:50.926
IN FRONT OF THE TOBU-TOJO LINE,

00:02:50.926 --> 00:02:51.994
LOOKING ALL CONFUSED AND

00:02:51.994 --> 00:02:53.061
EVERYTHING?

00:02:53.061 --> 00:02:53.928
SIMPLE.

00:02:53.928 --> 00:02:55.429
IN APRIL, I START MY FIRST

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:57.029
SEMESTER AT RAIRA ACADEMY

00:02:57.029 --> 00:02:58.997
IN EAST IKEBUKURO.

00:02:58.997 --> 00:03:00.398
IT’S A GOOD SCHOOL WITH GREAT

00:03:00.398 --> 00:03:01.832
FACILITIES.

00:03:01.832 --> 00:03:03.800
THE CAMPUS IS PRETTY SWEET, TOO.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.468
BUT THE REAL REASON I’M HERE IS

00:03:05.468 --> 00:03:06.268
BECAUSE A FRIEND FROM

00:03:06.268 --> 00:03:07.869
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WANTED ME TO

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:08.836
COME.

00:03:08.836 --> 00:03:09.836
MY PARENTS WANTED ME TO STAY

00:03:09.836 --> 00:03:11.237
HOME AND GO TO SCHOOL THERE.

00:03:11.237 --> 00:03:12.205
BUT I’VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE

00:03:12.205 --> 00:03:13.105
TOKYO.

00:03:13.105 --> 00:03:14.373
&gt;&gt; MIKADO!

00:03:14.373 --> 00:03:16.140
&gt;&gt; OH!

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.175
HOW’D YOU...MASAOMI?

00:03:19.175 --> 00:03:20.876
&gt;&gt; WAS THAT A QUESTION?

00:03:20.876 --> 00:03:22.143
SOUNDED LIKE ONE.

00:03:22.143 --> 00:03:23.411
SO NOW YOU GET THREE ANSWERS

00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:24.711
TO CHOOSE FROM.

00:03:24.711 --> 00:03:27.013
ONE...MASAOMI KIDA!

00:03:27.013 --> 00:03:28.947
TWO...MASAOMI KIDA!

00:03:28.947 --> 00:03:31.115
THREE...MASAOMI KIDA!

00:03:31.115 --> 00:03:33.283
&gt;&gt; WOW, MASAOMI, NO WAY!

00:03:33.283 --> 00:03:34.450
IT’S REALLY YOU?

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.950
&gt;&gt; [sighs] I SPENT THREE YEARS

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.018
COMIN’ UP WITH THAT ONE,

00:03:37.018 --> 00:03:39.019
AND HE TOTALLY IGNORES IT.

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.953
I MISSED YA, MAN!

00:03:40.953 --> 00:03:41.921
&gt;&gt; I CAN’T BELIEVE YOU DYED

00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:42.821
YOUR HAIR.

00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:43.855
IT LOOKS COOL.

00:03:43.855 --> 00:03:44.789
YOU LOOK SO DIFFERENT,

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:46.423
I DIDN’T RECOGNIZE YOU.

00:03:46.423 --> 00:03:48.224
ALTHOUGH YOUR JOKES STILL SUCK.

00:03:48.224 --> 00:03:49.292
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

00:03:49.292 --> 00:03:50.825
IT’S BEEN FOUR YEARS.

00:03:50.825 --> 00:03:51.893
LOOK AT YOU.

00:03:51.893 --> 00:03:52.859
YOU HAVEN’T CHANGED.

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:53.894
YOU LOOK THE SAME AS YOU DID

00:03:53.894 --> 00:03:55.095
IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

00:03:55.095 --> 00:03:56.862
AND, BUDDY, MY JOKES DON’T SUCK.

00:03:56.862 --> 00:03:58.096
THEY RULE.

00:03:58.096 --> 00:03:59.063
&gt;&gt; [thinking] YUP, THAT’S

00:03:59.063 --> 00:04:01.731
MASAOMI KIDA, MY BEST FRIEND.

00:04:01.731 --> 00:04:02.932
I HAVEN’T SEEN HIM SINCE HE

00:04:02.932 --> 00:04:03.899
TRANSFERRED OUT OF OUR

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:05.233
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

00:04:05.233 --> 00:04:06.834
AND BESIDES THE HAIR, HE HASN’T

00:04:06.834 --> 00:04:07.801
CHANGED AT ALL.

00:04:07.801 --> 00:04:09.435
&gt;&gt; COME ON. LET’S GO,

00:04:09.435 --> 00:04:11.003
GET OUT FROM UNDERGROUND.

00:04:11.003 --> 00:04:12.804
I FEEL LIKE GOING WEST TODAY,

00:04:12.804 --> 00:04:13.805
YOUNG MAN.

00:04:13.805 --> 00:04:14.938
BUT WE’RE NOT TAKING THE WEST

00:04:14.938 --> 00:04:16.272
EXIT.

00:04:16.272 --> 00:04:17.273
WE’RE GONNA TAKE...

00:04:17.273 --> 00:04:18.307
&gt;&gt; MAN, HIS JOKES SUCK.

00:04:18.307 --> 00:04:20.174
BUT HE’S A GOOD GUY.

00:04:20.174 --> 00:04:21.875
WE’D BEEN CHATTING ONLINE EVERY

00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:23.410
DAY, SO I DIDN’T REALIZE

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.744
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN US

00:04:24.744 --> 00:04:25.411
OR HOW LONG IT’D BEEN.

00:04:25.411 --> 00:04:26.812
[Masaomi chattering]

00:04:26.812 --> 00:04:28.913
BUT SEEING HIM AGAIN NOW, FOUR

00:04:28.913 --> 00:04:30.280
YEARS LATER, YOU COULD TELL ME

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.947
AND HIM GREW UP IN TOTALLY

00:04:31.947 --> 00:04:32.948
DIFFERENT PLACES.

00:04:32.948 --> 00:04:33.949
&gt;&gt; MAN, IF MY JOKES WEREN’T SO

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:35.016
LAME, I WOULDN’T HAVE TO

00:04:35.016 --> 00:04:36.250
EXPLAIN ’EM ALL THE TIME...

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.283
&gt;&gt; DON’T GET ME WRONG.

00:04:37.283 --> 00:04:38.451
HE’S STILL THE SAME GUY,

00:04:38.451 --> 00:04:39.852
SAME BAD JOKES AND ALL.

00:04:39.852 --> 00:04:40.852
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO FIRST?

00:04:40.852 --> 00:04:41.753
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANNA

00:04:41.753 --> 00:04:42.753
CHECK OUT?

00:04:42.753 --> 00:04:43.787
&gt;&gt; I DON’T KNOW.

00:04:43.787 --> 00:04:45.222
HOW BOUT SUNSHINE 60?

00:04:45.222 --> 00:04:47.056
&gt;&gt; WHAT, LIKE RIGHT NOW?

00:04:47.056 --> 00:04:47.956
MAN, THAT’S WHERE YOU TAKE

00:04:47.956 --> 00:04:49.090
YOUR GIRLFRIEND, NOT YOUR BEST

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.990
FRIEND.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.891
&gt;&gt; OH, UM, WHAT ABOUT

00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:53.326

&gt;&gt; OH, I JUST THAT THOUGHT ALL

00:04:56.928 --> 00:04:58.829
THE IKEBUKURIANS CALLED IT THAT.

00:04:58.829 --> 00:05:01.096
&gt;&gt; WHAT’S AN IKEBUKURIAN?

00:05:01.096 --> 00:05:01.997
WAIT.

00:05:01.997 --> 00:05:03.197
YOU REALLY WANNA GO?

00:05:03.197 --> 00:05:05.165
&gt;&gt; HUH? WELL, I--I WAS JUST--

00:05:05.165 --> 00:05:07.133
HEY, WAIT, HOLD IT!

00:05:07.133 --> 00:05:08.834
IT’S COOL--I DON’T WANNA GO!

00:05:08.834 --> 00:05:10.368
I MEAN, IT’S DARK NOW.

00:05:10.368 --> 00:05:11.436
AND HEY, WE COULD GET KILLED

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:12.436
BY A COLOR GANG!

00:05:12.436 --> 00:05:13.903
&gt;&gt; OH, COME ON, MAN!

00:05:19.206 --> 00:05:21.007
I GUESS SOME THINGS NEVER

00:05:21.007 --> 00:05:24.043
CHANGE, HUH?

00:05:29.011 --> 00:05:30.846
&gt;&gt; HOW’S IT GOING?

00:05:30.846 --> 00:05:32.147
&gt;&gt; EVENING.

00:05:32.147 --> 00:05:33.381
&gt;&gt; HEY, SETTON!

00:05:33.381 --> 00:05:34.881
SO GUESS WHAT?

00:05:34.881 --> 00:05:35.882
STARTING TOMORROW, I’M GONNA BE

00:05:35.882 --> 00:05:37.350
LIVING IN IKEBUKURO.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.884
&gt;&gt; OH, REALLY?

00:05:38.884 --> 00:05:40.151
YOU MIGHT END UP LIVING NEAR

00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:41.052
ME, THEN.

00:05:41.052 --> 00:05:42.553
&gt;&gt; MAYBE SO.

00:05:42.553 --> 00:05:44.153
I’M STILL AT HOME NOW, BUT,

00:05:44.153 --> 00:05:45.954
YEAH, BY THIS TIME TOMORROW,

00:05:45.954 --> 00:05:46.855
I’M GONNA BE LIVING IN

00:05:46.855 --> 00:05:49.356
AN APARTMENT NEAR SUNSHINE.

00:05:49.356 --> 00:05:52.858
&gt;&gt; WELCOME TO IKEBUKURO.

00:05:52.858 --> 00:05:54.925
&gt;&gt; WOW!

00:05:54.925 --> 00:05:56.226
A WORLD THAT I’D ONLY SEEN IN

00:05:56.226 --> 00:05:58.161
MANGA AND ONLINE IS RIGHT HERE

00:05:58.161 --> 00:05:59.862
IN FRONT OF ME.

00:05:59.862 --> 00:06:01.429
IT’S COOLER THAN KAMISAKURA

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:02.930
MACHI-GINZA!

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.798
&gt;&gt; [chuckling] THEN I GUESS I

00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:06.031
GOTTA TAKE YOU TO SHIBUYA

00:06:06.031 --> 00:06:06.932
SOMETIME.

00:06:06.932 --> 00:06:07.999
BUT IF YOU’RE LOOKING FOR

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:09.000
CROWDS, THE HORSE TRACK’S

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
PROBABLY BETTER.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.001
&gt;&gt; HEH!

00:06:12.001 --> 00:06:13.235
&gt;&gt; THERE AREN’T TOO MANY COLOR

00:06:13.235 --> 00:06:14.403
GANGS ANYMORE.

00:06:14.403 --> 00:06:15.803
BUNCH OF FLASHY ONES WERE

00:06:15.803 --> 00:06:17.037
HANGING AROUND LAST YEAR,

00:06:17.037 --> 00:06:18.205
BUT THEY CLASHED WITH THE GANGS

00:06:18.205 --> 00:06:19.572
IN SAITAMA, AND MOST OF ’EM GOT

00:06:19.572 --> 00:06:20.806
BUSTED.

00:06:20.806 --> 00:06:21.974
EVER SINCE THEN, YOU DON’T SEE

00:06:21.974 --> 00:06:23.408
PEOPLE STANDING AROUND WEARING

00:06:23.408 --> 00:06:25.476
THE SAME COLOR CLOTHES ANYMORE.

00:06:25.476 --> 00:06:27.042
I GUESS EVERYONE KNOWS THAT IF

00:06:27.042 --> 00:06:27.977
THEY DO THAT, THE COPS WOULD BE

00:06:27.977 --> 00:06:29.511
AFTER THEM IN A SEC.

00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:30.879
&gt;&gt; DOES THAT MEAN IKEBUKURO’S

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:32.112
A SAFE CITY NOW?

00:06:32.112 --> 00:06:33.180
&gt;&gt; UH, YEAH, RIGHT!

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.313
I MEAN, I’M NO EXPERT OR

00:06:34.313 --> 00:06:35.981
ANYTHING, BUT I WOULDN’T REALLY

00:06:35.981 --> 00:06:37.882
CONSIDER THIS PLACE SAFE.

00:06:37.882 --> 00:06:39.049
THERE’S WORSE THINGS HERE

00:06:39.049 --> 00:06:40.584
THAN GANGS, YOU KNOW?

00:06:40.584 --> 00:06:41.517
BE CAREFUL.

00:06:41.517 --> 00:06:43.919
&gt;&gt; OH, I SEE.

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:45.953
&gt;&gt; ANYWAY, THIS IS 60 STORY

00:06:45.953 --> 00:06:47.020
STREET, AND THERE’S ANOTHER ROAD

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.021
CALLED SUNSHINE STREET.

00:06:49.021 --> 00:06:50.055
&gt;&gt; [thinking] I WONDER IF THEY

00:06:50.055 --> 00:06:51.923
MADE SUNSHINE STREET FIRST.

00:06:51.923 --> 00:06:53.224
UH! SORRY!

00:06:53.224 --> 00:06:59.060
I WASN’T PAYING ATTENTION!

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.995
&gt;&gt; both: HMM.

00:07:00.995 --> 00:07:02.228
&gt;&gt; OH, HEY, MASAOMI.

00:07:02.228 --> 00:07:04.830
&gt;&gt; OH, HEY, ERIKA, WALKER.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.031
WHAT’S NEW?

00:07:06.031 --> 00:07:07.064
&gt;&gt; HEY, HEY, MAN, IT’S BEEN

00:07:07.064 --> 00:07:07.899
A WHILE.

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:08.999
&gt;&gt; YO!

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:10.966
MASAOMI, WHAT UP?

00:07:10.966 --> 00:07:12.001
&gt;&gt; HEY, HOW’S IT GOIN’?

00:07:12.001 --> 00:07:13.334
&gt;&gt; WHO’S THIS GUY YOU’RE WITH?

00:07:13.334 --> 00:07:14.535
HE A FRIEND OF YOURS?

00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:16.036
&gt;&gt; YEAH, ME AND THIS GUY GO WAY,

00:07:16.036 --> 00:07:17.103
WAY BACK.

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:18.204
HE JUST MOVED TO IKEBUKURO

00:07:18.204 --> 00:07:19.305
TODAY.

00:07:19.305 --> 00:07:21.006
&gt;&gt; OH, COOL.

00:07:21.006 --> 00:07:23.373
&gt;&gt; THIS YOUNG LADY IS ERIKA.

00:07:23.373 --> 00:07:24.373
AND THIS UPSTANDING GUY IS

00:07:24.373 --> 00:07:26.308
WALKER.

00:07:26.308 --> 00:07:27.475
AND LURKING OVER THERE IS

00:07:27.475 --> 00:07:30.944
KYOHEI AND SABURO.

00:07:30.944 --> 00:07:32.345
&gt;&gt; SORRY.

00:07:32.345 --> 00:07:33.345
MY NAME’S MIKADO RYUGAMINE.

00:07:33.345 --> 00:07:34.346
&gt;&gt; HMM?

00:07:34.346 --> 00:07:37.881
&gt;&gt; HMMMM.

00:07:37.881 --> 00:07:38.915
&gt;&gt; [thinking] I JUST SAID

00:07:38.915 --> 00:07:40.516
SOMETHING STUPID, DIDN’T I?

00:07:40.516 --> 00:07:42.183
&gt;&gt; HMM. MAYBE IT’S A PEN NAME?

00:07:42.183 --> 00:07:42.983
&gt;&gt; OH, COME ON.

00:07:42.983 --> 00:07:44.918
WHY WOULD A KID IN HIGH SCHOOL

00:07:44.918 --> 00:07:46.052
HAVE A PEN NAME?

00:07:46.052 --> 00:07:47.220
WAIT!

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.053
HE COULD HAVE A RADIO SHOW

00:07:48.053 --> 00:07:49.087
OR A BLOG!

00:07:49.087 --> 00:07:50.387
&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY, THAT IS MY REAL

00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:51.255
NAME.

00:07:51.255 --> 00:07:52.022
&gt;&gt; both: HMM?

00:07:52.022 --> 00:07:52.989
&gt;&gt; NO WAY!

00:07:52.989 --> 00:07:54.056
THAT’S YOUR NAME?

00:07:54.056 --> 00:07:55.090
&gt;&gt; HOLY CRAP!

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.091
YOU GOT THE COOLEST NAME EVER!

00:07:57.091 --> 00:07:57.991
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT’S OUT OF

00:07:57.991 --> 00:07:59.292
A MANGA OR SOMETHING!

00:07:59.292 --> 00:08:00.160
&gt;&gt; STOP IT!

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.527
YOU’RE EMBARRASSING ME!

00:08:01.527 --> 00:08:02.928
&gt;&gt; [thinking] I’M NOT FOLLOWING.

00:08:02.928 --> 00:08:03.995
AM I SUPPOSED TO BE LAUGHING

00:08:03.995 --> 00:08:05.129
NOW?

00:08:05.129 --> 00:08:07.364
&gt;&gt; YOU GUYS GO SHOPPING?

00:08:07.364 --> 00:08:08.597
&gt;&gt; YEP.

00:08:08.597 --> 00:08:09.965

BEFORE ANYONE KNEW WHAT HIT ’EM.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.168
&gt;&gt; DENGEKI BUNKO PUTS OUT

00:08:15.168 --> 00:08:17.069
30 BOOKS A MONTH?

00:08:17.069 --> 00:08:18.102
&gt;&gt; NO WAY, IT’S NOT LIKE THAT

00:08:18.102 --> 00:08:18.937
AT ALL.

00:08:18.937 --> 00:08:20.371
THE TWO OF US EACH GET A COPY

00:08:20.371 --> 00:08:21.871
OF THE LATEST SERIES.

00:08:21.871 --> 00:08:23.105
AND THE OTHER TEN...

00:08:23.105 --> 00:08:25.506
WELL, THAT’S FOR OTHER REASONS!

00:08:25.506 --> 00:08:27.241
&gt;&gt; YEAH, OTHER REASONS!

00:08:27.241 --> 00:08:28.075
[both laughing]

00:08:28.075 --> 00:08:28.942
&gt;&gt; [thinking] WHAT OTHER

00:08:28.942 --> 00:08:29.976
REASONS?

00:08:29.976 --> 00:08:31.977
LIKE ONE COPY TO KEEP, ONE FOR

00:08:31.977 --> 00:08:32.877
WORK, ONE TO LOAN OUT TO

00:08:32.877 --> 00:08:34.045
FRIENDS?

00:08:34.045 --> 00:08:35.879
&gt;&gt; WELL, I GUESS WE BETTER BE

00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:36.912

&gt;&gt; YEAH, SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

00:08:38.914 --> 00:08:39.614
&gt;&gt; RIGHT ON.

00:08:39.614 --> 00:08:40.548
PEACE OUT.

00:08:40.548 --> 00:08:41.549
&gt;&gt; WATCH WHERE I’M GOIN’,

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:42.616

&gt;&gt; SEE YOU AROUND.

00:08:43.983 --> 00:08:45.051
&gt;&gt; HEY, YOU’RE MESSIN’ UP

00:08:45.051 --> 00:08:45.984

&gt;&gt; SORRY!

00:08:47.118 --> 00:08:48.118
&gt;&gt; SHE WAS STEERIN’!

00:08:48.118 --> 00:08:48.919
&gt;&gt; I KNOW, I KNOW.

00:08:48.919 --> 00:08:49.886
THEY’RE KINDA WEIRD.

00:08:49.886 --> 00:08:50.654
BUT IF YOU’RE COOL WITH THEM,

00:08:50.654 --> 00:08:52.155

I KNOW WHERE ALL THE COOL SHOPS

00:09:02.393 --> 00:09:03.094
ARE...

00:09:03.094 --> 00:09:04.027
&gt;&gt; [thinking] I WONDER WHAT KIND

00:09:04.027 --> 00:09:05.028
OF STUFF HE’S DONE IN THE PAST

00:09:05.028 --> 00:09:07.929
FOUR YEARS...WHILE I WAS BACK

00:09:07.929 --> 00:09:09.664
AT HOME DOING NOTHING.

00:09:09.664 --> 00:09:10.965
&gt;&gt; I MEAN, KNOWING WHERE ALL THE

00:09:10.965 --> 00:09:12.399
COOL STUFF’S AT MAKES IT EASIER

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:13.499

00:09:13.499 --> 00:09:14.400
LIKE THAT ONE.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.201
&gt;&gt; [thinking] WHAT A PERV.

00:09:17.201 --> 00:09:18.969
&gt;&gt; OKAY, SHE’S HERE.

00:09:18.969 --> 00:09:22.237
&gt;&gt; YOU SURE IT’S HER?

00:09:22.237 --> 00:09:24.172
&gt;&gt; WITHOUT A DOUBT.

00:09:24.172 --> 00:09:25.273
SHE MATCHES THE DESCRIPTION

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:26.906
WE GOT HEAD TO TOE.

00:09:26.906 --> 00:09:29.108
&gt;&gt; HEH! ROGER.

00:09:29.108 --> 00:09:29.975

00:09:31.142 --> 00:09:32.977
&gt;&gt; AND, YO, DON’T USE TOO MUCH.

00:09:32.977 --> 00:09:34.377
IF SHE DON’T WAKE UP, THEY’RE

00:09:34.377 --> 00:09:36.044
GONNA TAKE IT OUT OF OUR PAY.

00:09:36.044 --> 00:09:37.012
KEEP THAT IN MIND.

00:09:37.012 --> 00:09:38.980
&gt;&gt; I LOVE TEENAGE CHICKS!

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.147

&gt;&gt; GOOD EVENING.

00:09:55.322 --> 00:09:57.090

00:09:59.124 --> 00:10:00.157
OH.

00:10:00.157 --> 00:10:01.225
I JUST READ THAT LAST PART.

00:10:01.225 --> 00:10:02.559
YOU’RE MOVING TO TOKYO?

00:10:02.559 --> 00:10:04.394
CONGRATULATIONS!

00:10:04.394 --> 00:10:05.294

&gt;&gt; YEAH, LET’S.

00:10:08.162 --> 00:10:09.262
THAT WOULD BE FUN.

00:10:09.262 --> 00:10:10.997
&gt;&gt; TOTALLY.

00:10:10.997 --> 00:10:12.098
OH, THAT’S RIGHT.

00:10:12.098 --> 00:10:14.165
EVER HEAR ABOUT SUICIDE PACTS?

00:10:14.165 --> 00:10:15.132
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THOSE WERE POPULAR

00:10:15.132 --> 00:10:16.233
FOR A WHILE.

00:10:16.233 --> 00:10:17.567
PEOPLE MEET ONLINE, THEN COMMIT

00:10:17.567 --> 00:10:18.467
SUICIDE.

00:10:18.467 --> 00:10:20.535
&gt;&gt; HORRIBLE, ISN’T IT?

00:10:20.535 --> 00:10:21.469
YOU DON’T REALLY HEAR ABOUT

00:10:21.469 --> 00:10:22.336
THAT HAPPENING MUCH ANYMORE,

00:10:22.336 --> 00:10:23.537
DO YOU?

00:10:23.537 --> 00:10:24.570
&gt;&gt; THEY PROBABLY COULDN’T KILL

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:25.638
THEMSELVES.

00:10:25.638 --> 00:10:26.539
&gt;&gt; MAYBE THERE WERE LOTS OF

00:10:26.539 --> 00:10:28.039
SUICIDES, JUST THAT NO ONE’S

00:10:28.039 --> 00:10:30.140
FOUND OUT ABOUT THEM YET.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.241
LIKE, THEY HAVEN’T FOUND

00:10:31.241 --> 00:10:32.975
THE BODIES OR SOMETHING.

00:10:32.975 --> 00:10:34.143
&gt;&gt; UGH!

00:10:34.143 --> 00:10:35.676
&gt;&gt; DON’T BE CREEPY.

00:10:35.676 --> 00:10:37.111
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:10:37.111 --> 00:10:38.545
HAVE BEEN DISAPPEARING LATELY.

00:10:38.545 --> 00:10:40.513
&gt;&gt; HUH? YOU SERIOUS?

00:10:40.513 --> 00:10:43.114
&gt;&gt; WELL...MOSTLY IT’S ILLEGAL

00:10:43.114 --> 00:10:45.149
ALIENS, BUT NOT JUST THEM.

00:10:45.149 --> 00:10:47.550
RUNAWAY KIDS, TOO.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.118
THEY DISAPPEAR BETWEEN

00:10:49.118 --> 00:10:51.452
IKEBUKURO AND SHIBUYA.

00:10:51.452 --> 00:10:54.020
&gt;&gt; EXCUSE ME.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.054

00:10:58.123 --> 00:11:00.357
OH! ARE YOU MR. NAKURA?

00:11:00.357 --> 00:11:01.724
&gt;&gt; WONDERFUL!

00:11:01.724 --> 00:11:02.725
I KNEW IT WAS YOU WHEN I SAW

00:11:02.725 --> 00:11:03.525

&gt;&gt; WE’RE ALMOST THERE.

00:11:17.699 --> 00:11:19.500
OH, TWO OTHERS ARE WAITING FOR

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.568
US.

00:11:20.568 --> 00:11:22.202
&gt;&gt; OH.

00:11:22.202 --> 00:11:25.237
&gt;&gt; WELL, THERE IT IS.

00:11:32.041 --> 00:11:35.042
&gt;&gt; HELLO!

00:11:35.042 --> 00:11:36.143
&gt;&gt; HELLO.

&gt;&gt; WE GOOD TO GO?

00:11:37.977 --> 00:11:39.178
&gt;&gt; THE COAST COULDN’T BE

00:11:39.178 --> 00:11:40.211
CLEARER.

00:11:40.211 --> 00:11:42.112
&gt;&gt; SORRY TO TRICK YOU LIKE THIS,

00:11:42.112 --> 00:11:43.280
DOLLFACE.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.180
GET IN HERE!

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.549
&gt;&gt; AAH!

00:11:46.549 --> 00:11:50.084
[muffled shouts]

00:11:50.084 --> 00:11:52.118
[engine starts]

00:12:03.091 --> 00:12:05.192
&gt;&gt; THE COAST ISN’T EXACTLY

00:12:05.192 --> 00:12:06.292
CLEAR.

00:12:12.596 --> 00:12:13.563
&gt;&gt; [thinking] MASAOMI KEPT RIGHT

00:12:13.563 --> 00:12:15.464
ON TALKING AND TALKING,

00:12:15.464 --> 00:12:16.731
AND I WAS STARTING TO GET

00:12:16.731 --> 00:12:17.631
TIRED.

00:12:17.631 --> 00:12:19.166
I DON’T KNOW IF IT WAS ALL THE

00:12:19.166 --> 00:12:20.667
WALKING WE WERE DOING, OR ALL

00:12:20.667 --> 00:12:22.168
THE BAD JOKES HE WAS RATTLING

00:12:22.168 --> 00:12:22.634
OFF.

00:12:22.634 --> 00:12:23.669
&gt;&gt; NOW THAT WE’RE HANGING OUT...

00:12:23.669 --> 00:12:25.636
&gt;&gt; PROBABLY A LITTLE OF BOTH.

00:12:25.636 --> 00:12:26.636
&gt;&gt; IT’S WEIRD, ISN’T IT?

00:12:26.636 --> 00:12:28.204
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I GUESS SO.

00:12:28.204 --> 00:12:29.638
&gt;&gt; I MEAN, I’VE GOT, LIKE, 400

00:12:29.638 --> 00:12:31.373
THINGS TO TELL YOU ABOUT, BUT SO

00:12:31.373 --> 00:12:32.639
FAR I’VE ONLY TOLD YOU, LIKE,

00:12:32.639 --> 00:12:33.640
FIVE OF THEM.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.608
AND SO YOU KNOW, ERIKA AND

00:12:34.608 --> 00:12:36.241
THOSE GUYS ARE 4 OF THAT 400.

00:12:36.241 --> 00:12:37.176
&gt;&gt; [thinking] I WAS DEBATING THE

00:12:37.176 --> 00:12:38.777
PROS AND CONS OF PLAYING ALONG,

00:12:38.777 --> 00:12:40.178
BUT THEN I SAW...

00:12:40.178 --> 00:12:41.244
&gt;&gt; HELLO THERE, MISS!

00:20:13.488 --> 00:20:14.555
COLOR THEY ARE.

00:20:14.555 --> 00:20:15.956
WHAT’S THE POINT, RIGHT?

00:20:15.956 --> 00:20:17.557

NEVER EXPERIENCE ANYWHERE ELSE.

00:22:24.792 --> 00:22:26.827

00:22:36.765 --> 00:22:37.799
I GUESS I’M CONTRADICTING WHAT

00:22:37.799 --> 00:22:38.966
