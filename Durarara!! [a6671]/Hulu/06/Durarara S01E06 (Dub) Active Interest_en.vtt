00:08:01.347 --> 00:08:02.814
AND REALLY MEANT TO SAY THAT

00:08:02.814 --> 00:08:03.482
HE’D BEEN KIDNAPPED.

00:08:03.482 --> 00:08:05.516
&gt;&gt; [laughs] THERE’S NO WAY.

00:08:05.516 --> 00:08:07.885

&gt;&gt; YEAH, EXACTLY.

00:08:30.534 --> 00:08:32.002
JUST BECAUSE MIKA HAS GONE

00:08:32.002 --> 00:08:33.270
MISSING, IT DOESN’T MEAN SHE

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.504

00:10:15.207 --> 00:10:17.309
PLACE.

&gt;&gt; WHA--WHAT THE HELL?

00:10:25.248 --> 00:10:26.449
&gt;&gt; SO I’M GUESSING "I BROKE

00:10:26.449 --> 00:10:27.983
A PLATE" ISN’T WHAT HE REALLY

00:10:27.983 --> 00:10:29.217
MEANT TO TELL US.

00:10:29.217 --> 00:10:30.918
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:10:30.918 --> 00:10:32.186
&gt;&gt; HE MEANT A BOWL.

00:10:32.186 --> 00:10:33.320
&gt;&gt; [grunts]

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.321
&gt;&gt; DOTACHIN

00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:37.057
&gt;&gt; SIMPLE KANJI CONVERTER.

00:10:37.057 --> 00:10:39.391
&gt;&gt; WHAT HAS HE DONE NOW?

00:10:39.391 --> 00:10:40.492
[plate breaks]

00:10:40.492 --> 00:10:41.293
all: HUH?

00:10:41.293 --> 00:10:42.461
&gt;&gt; HE HAD TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY

00:10:42.461 --> 00:10:46.196
THE LOWLIFES WHO TRAFFIC HUMANS.

00:10:46.196 --> 00:10:50.066
HE’S GONE FOR GOOD NOW.

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:51.467
HOW THE HELL AM I GONNA GET BY

00:10:51.467 --> 00:10:53.368
WITHOUT KAZUTANO AROUND?

00:10:53.368 --> 00:10:54.602
HE’S THE ONLY THING IN MY LIFE

00:10:54.602 --> 00:10:58.372
THAT WAS EVER ANY GOOD!

00:10:58.372 --> 00:11:00.239
&gt;&gt; WE ALL LIKE KAZUTANO.

00:11:00.239 --> 00:11:02.508
BUT FOR SABURO, THE IDEA OF

00:11:02.508 --> 00:11:04.642
LOSING HIM WAS ESPECIALLY HARD.

00:11:04.642 --> 00:11:06.210
NO ONE CAN FILL HIS SHOES.

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.944
IT KIND OF BUMS ME OUT THAT

00:11:07.944 --> 00:11:09.446
NOT EVEN ERIKA, WALKER, OR

00:11:09.446 --> 00:11:11.281
MYSELF CAN BE THERE FOR SABURO

00:11:11.281 --> 00:11:14.949
LIKE THAT.

00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:16.217
&gt;&gt; IF HE WAS KIDNAPPED RIGHT

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:17.285
WHEN THAT EMAIL CAME, THEN IT

00:11:17.285 --> 00:11:19.252
WASN’T THAT LONG AGO.

00:11:19.252 --> 00:11:20.553
WE’RE GONNA FIND HIM BEFORE THEY

00:11:20.553 --> 00:11:22.222
DROP HIM OFF, I PROMISE YOU.

00:11:22.222 --> 00:11:23.455
AND THEN WE’LL BRING HIM BACK.

00:11:23.455 --> 00:11:25.291
&gt;&gt; BUT HOW ARE WE GONNA DO THAT?

00:11:25.291 --> 00:11:26.424
&gt;&gt; [grunts]

00:11:26.424 --> 00:11:27.258
&gt;&gt; I KNOW.

00:11:27.258 --> 00:11:29.527
all: HUH?

00:11:29.527 --> 00:11:30.694
&gt;&gt; I HID. BUT I SAW THE CAR THEY

00:11:30.694 --> 00:11:32.028
DRIVE.

00:11:32.028 --> 00:11:33.262
&gt;&gt; HASIM!

00:11:33.262 --> 00:11:34.330

BROTHER-TYPE HELPER-FAIRY

00:11:36.465 --> 00:11:37.565
CHARACTER!

00:11:42.336 --> 00:11:43.369
&gt;&gt; IT HAS BEEN RUMORED

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:44.337
THAT ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF...

00:11:44.337 --> 00:11:46.005
&gt;&gt; YEAH? YEAH, I GOT IT.

00:11:46.005 --> 00:11:47.072
IF AND WHEN SHE FINDS THESE

00:11:47.072 --> 00:11:48.340
GUYS, MAKE SURE SHE GETS THE

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.274
FOREIGNER AND KEEPS HIM OUT OF

00:11:49.274 --> 00:11:50.308
HARM’S WAY.

00:11:50.308 --> 00:11:52.343
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHEN

00:11:52.343 --> 00:11:53.443
THEY’RE SUPPOSED TO HOOK UP WITH

00:11:53.443 --> 00:11:55.645
THEIR BUYER AND DROP HIM OFF.

00:11:55.645 --> 00:11:57.079
SO WE’RE TRYING TO GET TO HIM AS

00:11:57.079 --> 00:11:58.247

00:11:58.247 --> 00:11:59.715
&gt;&gt; OKAY, IT’S A BLACK VAN,

&gt;&gt; DON’T WORRY, KID.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.028
RUSSIAN WASABI ISN’T SPICY.

00:12:19.028 --> 00:12:20.062
&gt;&gt; DON’T LIE TO THE LITTLE GUY

00:12:20.062 --> 00:12:21.196
LIKE THAT.

00:12:21.196 --> 00:12:21.997
&gt;&gt; LET’S GO.

00:12:21.997 --> 00:12:27.000

00:12:38.108 --> 00:12:39.376
&gt;&gt; THESE GUYS ARE JUST HIRED

00:12:39.376 --> 00:12:41.744
GUNS FOR SOME EVIL CORPORATION.

00:12:41.744 --> 00:12:46.348
THEY’RE BASICALLY HENCHMEN.

00:12:46.348 --> 00:12:47.715
THEY KIDNAP INDIVIDUALS WHO

00:12:47.715 --> 00:12:48.582
WON’T BE TRACKED, LIKE

00:12:48.582 --> 00:12:50.016
FOREIGNERS, AND THEN HAND THEM

00:12:50.016 --> 00:12:51.384
OVER FOR CASH.

00:12:51.384 --> 00:12:52.418
THE PEOPLE THEY TAKE ARE

00:12:52.418 --> 00:12:54.186
PROBABLY BEING USED AS SUBJECTS

00:12:54.186 --> 00:12:57.055
FOR ALL KINDS OF UGLY THINGS.

00:12:57.055 --> 00:12:58.156
&gt;&gt; IT’S NO DIFFERENT THAN

00:12:58.156 --> 00:13:00.290
CANNIBALISM.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:01.558
&gt;&gt; OUR GUYS ON THE STREET

00:13:01.558 --> 00:13:02.559
HAVEN’T TURNED MUCH IN THIS

00:13:02.559 --> 00:13:03.426
MONTH.

00:13:03.426 --> 00:13:05.261
&gt;&gt; WELL, IT SEEMS OUT SUBJECTS

00:13:05.261 --> 00:13:06.062
HAVE BECOME A LITTLE BIT

00:13:06.062 --> 00:13:06.662
CAUTIOUS OF--

00:13:06.662 --> 00:13:08.096
&gt;&gt; I DON’T WANT EXCUSES. IF OUR

00:13:08.096 --> 00:13:09.230
GUYS CAN’T PRODUCE MORE, THEY’RE

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:10.097
FIRED.

00:13:10.097 --> 00:13:11.098
&gt;&gt; BUT, CHIEF--

00:13:11.098 --> 00:13:12.599
&gt;&gt; OR PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE TO

00:13:12.599 --> 00:13:15.368
BECOME A SUBJECT.

00:13:15.368 --> 00:13:19.337
GO NOW.

00:13:19.337 --> 00:13:22.373
[door opens, closes]

00:13:26.042 --> 00:13:27.977
SEIJI.

00:13:45.355 --> 00:13:46.456
&gt;&gt; IDIOT!

00:13:46.456 --> 00:13:48.057
&gt;&gt; [singing indistinctly]

00:13:48.057 --> 00:13:51.393
[cell phone ringing, vibrating]

00:13:53.195 --> 00:13:54.361
&gt;&gt; WE LOOKED EVERYWHERE WE COULD

00:13:54.361 --> 00:13:55.696
THINK OF FOR THAT BLACK VAN AND

00:13:55.696 --> 00:13:57.364
KAZUTANO.

00:13:57.364 --> 00:13:58.364
WE THOUGHT FOR SURE WE WOULD

00:13:58.364 --> 00:14:01.233
FIND HIM AND SAVE HIM.

00:14:01.233 --> 00:14:02.367
WE PULLED OUT EVERY TRICK WE

00:14:02.367 --> 00:14:04.536
HAD, BUT AFTER ALL THAT, WE

00:14:04.536 --> 00:14:07.371
STILL CAME UP WITH NOTHING.

00:14:07.371 --> 00:14:09.239
A SENSE OF DREAD STARTED TO

00:14:09.239 --> 00:14:10.240
CREEP IN.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.541
I BEGAN TO WONDER IF I’D EVER

00:14:11.541 --> 00:14:14.242
HEAR HIS CLASSIC LINES AGAIN.

00:14:14.242 --> 00:14:15.543
I’VE HEARD HIS TIMELESS PHRASES

00:14:15.543 --> 00:14:17.212
SO OFTEN, IT ALWAYS TAKES ME

00:14:17.212 --> 00:14:19.213
BACK TO BEING A KID.
