00:08:38.657 --> 00:08:40.558
SHE DIDN’T RESPOND.

00:08:40.558 --> 00:08:42.125
THEN YOU THOUGHT, "WELL, SHE

00:08:42.125 --> 00:08:43.426
MUST BE DEPRESSED, GIVEN

00:08:43.426 --> 00:08:44.460
EVERYTHING THAT’S HAPPENED TO

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.494
HER."

00:08:46.494 --> 00:08:49.529
ALL RIGHT THEN.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:50.896
WHAT ABOUT HER CELL?

00:08:50.896 --> 00:08:52.897
DID YOU TRY THAT?

00:08:52.897 --> 00:08:55.899
&gt;&gt; SHE’S GOT IT TURNED OFF.

00:08:55.899 --> 00:08:57.899
I DON’T GET IT.

00:08:57.899 --> 00:08:59.133
WHY IS KANRA SAYING ALL THIS

00:08:59.133 --> 00:09:00.301
STUFF?

00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:03.002
ALL HE’S DOING IS SCARING HER.

00:09:03.002 --> 00:09:04.536
&gt;&gt; THIS ANRI IS SONOHARA’S

00:09:04.536 --> 00:09:07.137
DAUGHTER, RIGHT?

00:09:07.137 --> 00:09:07.637
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:09:07.637 --> 00:09:09.105
&gt;&gt; HER DAD OWNED THE ANTIQUES

00:09:09.105 --> 00:09:10.305
STORE WHERE MY FATHER SOLD

00:09:10.305 --> 00:09:11.673
SAIKA.

00:09:11.673 --> 00:09:13.607
SO, THE LEADER OF THE DOLLARS

00:09:13.607 --> 00:09:15.441
IS ONE OF HER CLASSMATES.

00:09:15.441 --> 00:09:16.541
AND SHE HAS FRIENDS IN THE

00:09:16.541 --> 00:09:18.109
YELLOW SCARVES.

00:09:18.109 --> 00:09:19.176
[tapping keys]

00:09:19.176 --> 00:09:20.543
&gt;&gt; YES, BUT ANRI HAS NO IDEA

00:09:20.543 --> 00:09:21.678
THAT MIKADO WAS THE HEAD OF THE

00:09:21.678 --> 00:09:22.678
DOLLARS.

00:09:22.678 --> 00:09:23.945
&gt;&gt; SO THEN, THE THREE OF THEM

00:09:23.945 --> 00:09:26.046
ARE CLOSE FRIENDS, BUT EACH OF

00:09:26.046 --> 00:09:27.113
THEM HAS SOME KIND OF MAJOR

00:09:27.113 --> 00:09:28.581
SECRET THAT THEY’RE KEEPING

00:09:28.581 --> 00:09:30.048
FROM ONE ANOTHER.

00:09:30.048 --> 00:09:31.548
&gt;&gt; I THINK SO.

00:09:31.548 --> 00:09:32.583
BUT SHE DIDN’T TELL ME ANY

00:09:32.583 --> 00:09:35.284
OF THE DETAILS.

00:09:35.284 --> 00:09:36.284
&gt;&gt; I’M SORRY.

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:38.919
PLEASE DON’T ASK ME TO EXPLAIN.

00:09:38.919 --> 00:09:40.953
I’M SORRY.

00:09:48.223 --> 00:09:49.591
&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE VERY DEFINITION

00:09:49.591 --> 00:09:51.658
OF CHAOS.

00:09:51.658 --> 00:09:53.092
SO THEN, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:56.194
DO ABOUT IT?

00:09:56.194 --> 00:09:57.227
&gt;&gt; IF ANRI DOESN’T WANT THEM TO

00:09:57.227 --> 00:09:59.295
KNOW ANYTHING, THEN I HAVE TO

00:09:59.295 --> 00:10:01.629
KEEP QUIET, TOO.

00:10:01.629 --> 00:10:02.963
I JUST HOPE THOSE THREE WILL BE

00:10:02.963 --> 00:10:06.031
ALL RIGHT.

00:10:06.031 --> 00:10:07.665
&gt;&gt; HEY-HOHHH!

00:10:07.665 --> 00:10:10.266
KANRA’S IN THE HOUSE!

00:10:10.266 --> 00:10:11.501
WHAT’S GOING ON?

00:10:11.501 --> 00:10:13.268
NOBODY’S HERE?

00:10:13.268 --> 00:10:15.036
OH, COME ON, GUYS.

00:10:15.036 --> 00:10:16.136
DON’T TELL ME YOU’RE OUT HAVING

00:10:16.136 --> 00:10:18.104
A GOOD TIME WITHOUT ME?

00:10:18.104 --> 00:10:19.471
WELL, FINE.

00:10:19.471 --> 00:10:20.705
BUT IT’S ALL GOOD.

00:10:20.705 --> 00:10:22.039
BECAUSE I’M HAVING ONE HECK OF A

00:10:22.039 --> 00:10:25.007
SWEET TIME ALL BY MYSELF!

00:10:25.007 --> 00:10:26.041
THE GAME IS STARTING TO GET

00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:27.041
GOOD.

00:10:27.041 --> 00:10:28.342
SO I’M OUTTA HERE.

00:10:28.342 --> 00:10:30.610
LATER, GATORS!

00:10:37.579 --> 00:10:39.647
&gt;&gt; IT’S BEEN SEVERAL DAYS...

00:10:39.647 --> 00:10:40.715
AND I HAVEN’T LOOKED AT THE

00:10:40.715 --> 00:10:44.282
DOLLARS SITE SINCE.

00:10:44.282 --> 00:10:45.650
SEEMS LIKE THINGS IN THE CITY

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:48.218
JUST KEEP GETTING WORSE.

00:10:48.218 --> 00:10:49.619
BUT IN MY LIFE...

00:10:49.619 --> 00:10:52.953
NOTHING’S CHANGED.

00:10:52.953 --> 00:10:55.588
TAKIGUCHI LEFT THE HOSPITAL.

00:10:55.588 --> 00:10:57.522
IF I DON’T DO ANYTHING, I’LL

00:10:57.522 --> 00:11:00.090
HAVE PEACE.

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:03.591
THIS IS MY NORMAL LIFE.

00:11:03.591 --> 00:11:07.393
BUT STILL...

00:11:07.393 --> 00:11:08.193
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:11:08.193 --> 00:11:10.528

00:11:47.112 --> 00:11:49.047
[grunts]

00:11:49.047 --> 00:11:50.747
&gt;&gt; [grunts]

00:11:50.747 --> 00:11:52.381
&gt;&gt; HUH? WHAT?

[groans]

00:11:56.616 --> 00:11:58.184
&gt;&gt; GO ON, RUN.

00:11:58.184 --> 00:11:59.517
YOU SHOULD GO NOW.

00:11:59.517 --> 00:12:03.453
&gt;&gt; [yelps and pants]

00:12:03.453 --> 00:12:04.987
&gt;&gt; YO, MAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:12:04.987 --> 00:12:06.155

00:12:06.155 --> 00:12:07.621
COME ON, MAN. WHAT GIVES?

00:12:07.621 --> 00:12:10.657

&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:12:17.726 --> 00:12:19.694
&gt;&gt; MOTHER ASKED US TO STOP YOU.

00:12:19.694 --> 00:12:21.662
IT WAS HER REQUEST.

00:12:31.566 --> 00:12:33.067
&gt;&gt; IF SOMEONE FROM THE YELLOW

00:12:33.067 --> 00:12:34.401

I’M COUNTING ON YOU.

00:12:46.339 --> 00:12:47.374
&gt;&gt; UGH.

00:12:47.374 --> 00:12:51.076
HUH?

00:12:51.076 --> 00:12:52.476
&gt;&gt; [panting]

00:12:52.476 --> 00:12:55.578
IT’S MY FAULT.

00:12:55.578 --> 00:12:59.145
IT’S MY FAULT THAT MASAOMI--

00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:00.146

&gt;&gt; HELLO THERE.

00:13:20.755 --> 00:13:24.191
MOVE THE QUEEN TO C-K-6.

00:13:24.191 --> 00:13:28.193
BLACK TO G-K-6.

00:13:28.193 --> 00:13:30.627
OKAY, VERY NICE.

00:13:30.627 --> 00:13:33.695
NOW IT’S GETTING GOOD.

00:13:33.695 --> 00:13:34.696
&gt;&gt; COME ON!

00:13:34.696 --> 00:13:37.697

YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT.

[groans]

00:13:41.165 --> 00:13:42.165
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THAT?

00:13:42.165 --> 00:13:43.333
I CAN’T HEAR YOU?

00:13:43.333 --> 00:13:45.567
YOU SAY YOU CAN’T REMEMBER?

00:13:45.567 --> 00:13:48.068
WELL, THAT’S CRAP!

00:13:48.068 --> 00:13:49.136
&gt;&gt; I’M TELLING YOU--

00:13:49.136 --> 00:13:50.303
&gt;&gt; [grunts] WHAT WAS THAT?

&gt;&gt; IT’S TRUE, I SWEAR!

00:13:51.304 --> 00:13:52.204
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:13:52.204 --> 00:13:53.205
SPEAK UP!

00:13:53.205 --> 00:13:54.205
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.

00:13:54.205 --> 00:13:55.205
THAT’S ENOUGH.

00:13:55.205 --> 00:13:56.239
&gt;&gt; WE NEED TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE

00:13:56.239 --> 00:13:57.507
OUT OF THIS GUY.

00:14:02.375 --> 00:14:03.575
&gt;&gt; IS THIS TRUE?

00:14:03.575 --> 00:14:05.110
YOU REALLY HAVE NO MEMORY OF

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:06.444
WHAT YOU DID?

00:14:06.444 --> 00:14:08.078
&gt;&gt; I BLACKED OUT, AND WHEN I

00:14:08.078 --> 00:14:09.278
CAME TO, YOU WERE ALL MAD AT ME.

00:14:09.278 --> 00:14:10.679
&gt;&gt; THAT’S THE TRUTH.

00:14:10.679 --> 00:14:12.279
I SWEAR IT IS.

00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:13.547
&gt;&gt; HMM...MAYBE YOU WERE

00:14:13.547 --> 00:14:16.381
HYPNOTIZED. [laughs]

00:14:16.381 --> 00:14:18.582
SUDDENLY, YOU GOT VERY SLEEPY.

00:14:18.582 --> 00:14:20.183
THAT IT?

00:14:20.183 --> 00:14:22.218
&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY, THAT KIND OF SOUNDS

00:14:22.218 --> 00:14:23.352
ABOUT RIGHT.

00:14:23.352 --> 00:14:24.352
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:14:24.352 --> 00:14:27.153
&gt;&gt; I MEAN, DOESN’T IT?

00:14:27.153 --> 00:14:28.521
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:14:28.521 --> 00:14:29.722
IF THE DOLLARS HAVE THE HEADLESS

00:14:29.722 --> 00:14:32.823
RIDER, THEN WHY NOT A HYPNOTIST?

00:14:32.823 --> 00:14:34.257
&gt;&gt; B-B-BOSS?

00:14:34.257 --> 00:14:35.290
&gt;&gt; WHAT’S UP?

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.258
&gt;&gt; UH, YEAH, WELL, SEE...JUST

THIS CHICK.

00:14:39.792 --> 00:14:40.827
&gt;&gt; WHAT CHICK?

00:14:40.827 --> 00:14:42.594
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I REMEMBER THAT.

00:14:42.594 --> 00:14:44.128
&gt;&gt; I SAW THAT, TOO.

00:14:44.128 --> 00:14:45.162
&gt;&gt; COME TO THINK OF IT, THEY

00:14:45.162 --> 00:14:46.563
STARTED ACTING ALL STRANGE RIGHT

00:14:46.563 --> 00:14:48.296
AFTER THEY TALKED TO THAT GIRL.

00:14:48.296 --> 00:14:50.231
&gt;&gt; WELL, WHO WAS SHE?

00:14:50.231 --> 00:14:51.098
&gt;&gt; I DON’T KNOW.

00:14:51.098 --> 00:14:53.699
SHE HAD ON A RAIRA UNIFORM.

00:14:53.699 --> 00:14:55.734
SHE WORE GLASSES.

00:14:55.734 --> 00:14:57.200
AND I REMEMBER, LIKE, A SERIOUS

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.701
SET OF HOOTERS ON HER.

00:14:58.701 --> 00:15:00.369
&gt;&gt; [gasps]

00:15:00.369 --> 00:15:01.336
&gt;&gt; THAT GIRL WE SAW WITH THE

00:15:01.336 --> 00:15:03.137
HEADLESS RIDER HAD GLASSES ON.

00:15:03.137 --> 00:15:05.138
&gt;&gt; NO WAY. THAT CAN’T BE.

00:15:05.138 --> 00:15:06.139
&gt;&gt; SHE HAD SOME SERIOUS

00:15:06.139 --> 00:15:07.139
BOOBAGE, TOO.

00:15:07.139 --> 00:15:08.140
&gt;&gt; REALLY?

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.373
&gt;&gt; IT’S IMPOSSIBLE.

00:15:09.373 --> 00:15:10.441
&gt;&gt; LET’S GET ON IT!

00:15:10.441 --> 00:15:11.441

00:15:26.548 --> 00:15:27.549
NOW?

00:15:27.549 --> 00:15:29.249
NO ONE DOES ANYTHING.

00:15:29.249 --> 00:15:31.183
NOT UNTIL I SAY SO.

00:15:31.183 --> 00:15:34.385
&gt;&gt; [groans]

00:15:38.754 --> 00:15:41.488
