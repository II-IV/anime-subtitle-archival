1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,980
The problem isn't if the customer is good or not,

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,310
but whether if the shop is good or not.

The rainbow colored twilight is falling
Nanairo no tasogare orite kite

The wind is kinda refreshing
Kaze ha nandaka suzushige

Saturday night is lively
Doyoubi no yoru ha nigiyaka

The only thing that'll brighten soon are your dark emotions
Kurai kimochi sae sugu ni harete

Everyone can't wait

[Blissful Shop - Before] From Volume 1 Story 1

23
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,330
It's a blissful shop
[Blissful Shop - Before] From Volume 1 Story 1

24
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:26,360
It's a blissful shop

25
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,220
If the customer can have what they desire.

26
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,630
But no matter how the shop might glitter,

27
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,290
If the customer can't have their request fulfilled

28
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,510
The shop may as well be an empty warehouse.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,940
So what has this customer been doing all this time?

30
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,820
Homework.

31
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,600
Really?

32
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,260
Can I copy? Just the math homework...

33
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,430
Wasn't math the only homework?

34
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,730
Yeah yeah, fine. Lemme in.

35
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,010
Hey, sit on the other side.

36
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,200
No way. I'll make mistakes copying upside down.

37
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,650
No you won't

38
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,000
Will too

39
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,000
The number 9 could turn into a 6

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,520
And what are you gonna do if the katakana ヨ turns into an E!

41
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,760
Maybe when the Europeans started using 'E's

42
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,690
Someone miscopied it.

43
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,380
If this theory is true,

44
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,140
It could be an earth shaking discovery!

45
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,930
They don't use katakana in other countries.

46
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,660
Fine then, copy. Make it quick.

47
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,530
Thank you.

48
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,690
A shop where I can be alone with Hotori?

49
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,980
Heaven!

50
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:42,860
Hmm?

51
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,340
Ah. Nothing.

52
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,390
Everyone wants bliss,

53
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,480
There isn't a person who doesn't want it.

54
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,410
Why? It's because finding bliss

55
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,560
Rarely happens.

56
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,910
It's a slider if they shake their head twice, poko~

Arashiyama.

59
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,340
You copied your homework, didn't you?

60
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,600
Why?

61
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,220
Your answers are mostly right.

62
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,050
What's the problem?

63
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,210
I can do my homework when I need to.

64
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:21,970
However, you wrote the number 1 in place of the letter I.

65
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,760
Even if that were just a mistake, you wrote 1=0 instead of I=0.

66
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,990
Have any idea about that?

67
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,810
Uhh, I dunno.

68
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,320
Please see me in the office after school.

69
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,370
Auugh

70
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,690
This just had to happen after I managed to

71
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,110
complete my homework for once

72
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,790
Shouldn't that be what the teacher says?

73
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,420
I'll be late for work if I get lectured.

74
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,350
Oh, you have a job?

75
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,430
Yup, at a coffee shop in the neighborhood, wearing a maid outfit.

76
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,990
Could it be a maid café?

77
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,400
Yup, it is.

78
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,470
I just started though...

79
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,420
Huh, pretty classy.

80
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,040
We can have those sort of things here now.

81
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,550
How nice!

82
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,010
I adore maid cafés!

83
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,800
And talking to cute maids while sipping tea...

84
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,920
Hey Arashiyama, would it be ok to drop by your café?

85
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,770
Come, come! We have few customers so your seats are reserved.

86
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,000
^_^

87
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,620
Though it's grandma's store...

88
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,710
so it might be a bit different from what you imagined.

89
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,350
There are two ways imaginations can be cruel.

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,400
One way is using imagined worries to scare someone.

91
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,360
Another is to betray the imagination's high expectations.

92
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,940
Maid Café Seaside

93
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,530
Looks like this has to be it...

94
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,650
Not just a bit different... it's quite different from what I imagined.

95
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,830
Ah. Welcome.

96
00:05:59,060 --> 00:05:59,980
Welcome.

97
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,440
Hotori's friends?

98
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,400
Yeah.

99
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,660
Hey you two, take a seat.

100
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,340
It's empty so take any seat you want.

101
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,740
What should we put on the menu?

102
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,610
Oh! I bought some croquettes from Murakami - wanna eat these?

103
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,620
Tatsuno?

104
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,740
This...

105
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,370
This...

106
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,160
This place...

107
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,370
isn't a maid café!

108
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,040
What's up with "Hey welcome"? This isn't a sushi joint!

109
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,020
I... said that?

110
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,630
You did!

111
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,350
Maid cafés have maid café greetings, you know.

112
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,910
Uhh...

113
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,000
Hey! Welcome to our maid café!

114
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,140
Wrong wrong wrong!

115
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,030
This is how you do it, ok?

116
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,070
Your voice doesn't come from your throat and it doesn't come from your belly.

117
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,240
It feels like it comes from here, like...

118
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,130
Welcome home, master~

119
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,650
Ooo

120
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,280
That is a maid,

121
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,160
like what I've seen on TV.

122
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,430
This is basic knowledge. Try it.

123
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,320
Whaa? I have to?

124
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,610
Don't complain! Guys fall in love with that.

125
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,920
Just a maid outfit isn't enough to be a maid.

126
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,870
A maid outfit is enough!

127
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,970
You're pretty good, aren't ya?

128
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,650
Wouldn't you like to take Hotori's place and work here?

129
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,680
Thank you, but I've already decided to join a club

130
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,340
so I don't have time for a job.

131
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,430
We joined the ping pong club.

132
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,480
In place of that, however

133
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,540
I'll train Arashiyama today!

134
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,470
I don't really need it

135
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,730
I can't let this unrefined place call itself a maid café

136
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,090
Hotori, do it for me?

137
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,460
Please listen to her.

138
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,110
But this sort of thing isn't how I am.

139
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,740
Then why are you being a maid?

140
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,390
Hm? Good timing, our prey has arrived.

141
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,900
The dry cleaner guy?

142
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,900
Anyway, it's training.

143
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,520
Quick maid course #1: Maid greeting

144
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,410
Alright! Try what I just showed you before.

145
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,800
Wha? Seriously?

146
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,940
There's no better way to learn than from the real thing!

147
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,530
Now! Good luck, Arashiyama!

148
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,520
Wha

149
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:29,530
Wel

150
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,030
"Wel"?

151
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,180
Wel...

152
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,480
W-Welcome home, master!

153
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,090
She's nervous...

154
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,960
It's alright. In fact, it's this innocence that's

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
a hit!

156
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,070
I'm home, Daisy!

157
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,110
Who's Daisy?!

158
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,100
She went for a high angle hit!

159
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,620
Guess the guys around here aren't immune to that.

160
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,560
Grandma's specialty is seven pairs.

161
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,980
Quick maid course #2: Clumsy maid!

162
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,080
Arashiyama is clumsy without any help, no?

163
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,470
Completely true.

164
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,690
Can you not say rude things so casually?

165
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:25,150
But it's the control of clumsiness that makes a true clumsy maid.

166
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,060
Commit the clumsiness to muscle memory.

167
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,230
Mind if I order?

168
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,230
A Guatemala please.

169
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,480
A hot Guatemala.

170
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,810
Alright, it's your turn, Arashiyama!

171
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,150
How am I suppose to be clumsy?

172
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,650
It's alright. Leave it to me.

173
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,290
Here.

174
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,120
Haribara... now!

175
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:46,930
Got it.

176
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:52,860
(Sneeze)

177
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,190
Hooooot!

178
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,160
Wasn't that too cruel?

179
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,350
She continued the combo herself. She's a natural born klutz!

180
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,350
What are you doing!? You...

181
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,350
That was wonderful!

182
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,850
Quick, take this bucket and run!

183
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,370
Sorry! I'll clean it right up!

184
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,900
And now,

185
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,650
trip.

186
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,520
A three hit combo!

187
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,010
She's a goddess! A goddess has come!

188
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,600
Though not a god of maids.

189
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,640
More like a god of laughs.

190
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,530
No. A god of anger. Do you guys have some sort of grudge against me?

191
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,760
Sorry, you were clumsier than expected and we got carried away.

192
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,010
Is the Guatemala ready yet?

193
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,140
What's going on? It's unusually lively inside.

194
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,470
Prey number 2 is here.

195
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,250
C'mon, practice your greeting.

196
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,650
Sanada?

197
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,570
Why are you completely wet?

198
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,200
I'm dripping wet cuz I'm a good girl.

199
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,460
Did you finish getting lectured by the teacher?

200
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,000
Oh... forgot.

201
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,290
Don't say you copied it from me. He'll get mad at me too.

202
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,340
Arashiyama, have a moment?

203
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,970
Huh? What?

204
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,760
If I'm not mistaken,

205
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,050
that was Sanada from seat number 9, wasn't it?

206
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,410
Yeah it was.

207
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,830
Though I don't know his seat number...

208
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,290
Why does he know this shop?

209
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,620
What did he come for?

210
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,790
Does he come often?

211
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,340
Sanada's from the fish market in this neighborhood.

212
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,570
He comes here quite often.

213
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,640
Why?

214
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,660
I see.

215
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,400
This place is a wonderful maid café once you take a good look at it, isn't it?

216
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,360
Head maid,

217
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,860
Huh? I'm the manager.

218
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,380
I'm Tatsuno Toshiko.

219
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,190
Please let me work as a maid.

220
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:50,790
Eh?

221
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,170
What are you going to do about the club?

222
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,300
Didn't you say we were going to join the ping pong club?

223
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,700
There is a higher calling for me!

224
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,810
With this, we'll be more maid café like.

225
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,730
But, we'll have more staff than customers.

226
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,930
Even if it is the most run down place,

227
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,410
It's a blissful shop

228
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,270
If the customer can have what they desire.

229
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,800
What happen to Arashiyama...

230
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,320
[Blissful shop -  After]  From Volume 1 Story 2

[Blissful shop -  After]  From Volume 1 Story 2

234
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,310
that comes with a hint of loneliness.

235
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,950
It's because it's a sign that the day will end soon.

236
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,330
Alright!

237
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,140
Lets see what the day brings!

238
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,730
You start your day now?

239
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,070
Oh yeah, Sanada.

240
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,260
Tatsuno is starting at our shop today.

241
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:46,940
Wha?

242
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,690
She's actually doing it?

243
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,970
I was just waiting for the maid outfit to be made.

244
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,320
Grandma spent all day sewing it.

245
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,370
Those are hand made?

246
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,090
Well, I'll be leaving first.

247
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,470
Sanada, if you don't mind,

248
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,650
why don't you come later?

249
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,580
Oh... sure.

250
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,480
Hey. You girls.

251
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,820
Are you girls working a part time job without permission from school?

252
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,110
How did he find out?

253
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,430
I dunno.

254
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,000
But today...

255
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,170
We have to escape

256
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,850
Hey! Wait!

257
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:30,900
Damn it.

258
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,260
Lost sight of them.

259
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,470
I thought they came here for sure...

260
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,860
Isn't this pushing it?

261
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,990
It's ok.

262
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,360
There's Deva king statues in temples

263
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,540
so this isn't out of place.

264
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,360
No one will notice. It's a mind trick.

265
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,000
Where did they go?!

266
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,920
It's about time to go buy toilet paper, poko~

267
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,300
Jeez, the teacher made us late!

268
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,970
I hope Sanada didn't wait

269
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,550
Sorry for being late, head maid!

270
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,930
Welcome.

271
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:04,390
Welcome? It's just us, don't be so uptight.

272
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,670
I wasn't being uptight.

273
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,010
That was for the customer behind you.

274
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,320
Ow.

275
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,130
Customer? A customer...

276
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,770
is here!

277
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,050
Trying to lose me like that annoys me.

278
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,870
According to the student handbook, page 14, line 8

279
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,560
Non-approved part time jobs are prohibited by school regulations.

280
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,380
Under school regulation number 21, in the event that a part time job is desired

281
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,020
The homeroom teacher must approve in addition to acknowledgment by a school nurse.

282
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,980
My head hurts! Brother...
The homeroom teacher must approve in addition to acknowledgment by a school nurse.

283
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,180
My head hurts! Brother...

284
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,510
Please stop! You're exceeding the maximum tolerance level for Arashiyama's brain!

285
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,150
Save me, Mr. Mikuriya!

286
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,760
Who's Mikuriya? My name's Moriaki!

287
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,080
Anyway, I won't accept a job that violates school regulations.

288
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,420
Nobody follows that rule!

289
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,040
Now that I know, I can't let it pass as a homeroom teacher.

290
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,310
You're so strict! Just what I'd expect from a math teacher.

291
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,270
I've been wondering for a while...

292
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,860
How did you know we were going to work?

293
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,950
Now that you mention it,

294
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,220
how did that fact get out?

295
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,240
Could it be that there's a spy somewhere?

296
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,860
Oh yeah, Sanada. Tatsuno is starting at our shop today.

297
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,860
That time...

298
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,100
It got leaked and overheard!

299
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,560
You mean... me?

300
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:18,500
You're an idiot, aren't you? A real idiot.

301
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,250
Now we have no choice but to get permission for our job.

302
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,450
That's right. I didn't come to stop you.

303
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:29,110
But can we really get permission to work at a maid café?

304
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,920
We have to make him accept it.

305
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,180
with maid skills.

306
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,390
Maid skills?

307
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,230
We pretend to be submissive while winning the man's heart.

308
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,220
That's what a maid skill is. It's the basic philosophy of a maid café.

309
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,010
Isn't there some ethical problem with that?

310
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:43,730
Quiet!

311
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,150
This is a battle between the straight laced teacher and the charm of maids,

312
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:51,200
in other words, light and shadow, good and evil, white and black,

313
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,150
monkey and dog.

314
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,990
Yes. We cannot lose.

315
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,590
To the teacher, this job might look like an hobby,

316
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,080
but to me, this is Sanada's hangout.

317
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,170
I've found my blissful shop.

318
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,030
Head maid!

319
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,680
Is my outfit done?

320
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,140
Yeah, it's on a hanger in the back.

321
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,910
Arashiyama! We're changing into our battle uniforms!

322
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,050
Okay

323
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,640
Salmon is really a white fish, poko~

324
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,890
It's been 22 minutes since they said that.

325
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,800
It takes time for girls to get dressed.

326
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,740
Sorry for making you wait!

327
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,490
Maid number 2, taking care of you starting today, master.

328
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,600
Ditto, maid number 1.

329
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,660
Please, ask for anything, master.

330
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,080
I've lost!

331
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,000
Arashiyama?

332
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,280
I've lost in grades, face, style...

333
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,130
And on top of that, I've been crushed in maid outfit looks.

334
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,860
Get a hold of yourself!

335
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,920
Your battle isn't with me right now!

336
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,890
What am I?

337
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:02,730
You might not realize this, Arashiyama, but

338
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,720
you have one thing that you definitely can't lose in against Tatsuno.

339
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:12,250
So if I read between the lines, does this mean

340
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,320
that the teacher has something for me?

341
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,490
Arashiyama, the thing that you're better than Tatsuno at is...

342
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,620
Eyesight.

343
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,710
Oh.

344
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,290
So cruel to hear a third party say so flatly that

345
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,350
other than eyesight,

346
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,080
I lose at everything else.

347
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,130
Arashiyama? Arashiyama!

348
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:38,010
To destroy a maid's self-respect, critical to maid skills, before she even begins...

349
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,500
is maid murder!

350
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,410
This man is strong.

351
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,260
Tatsuno.

352
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,550
Yes?

353
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,440
Can I have black tea?

354
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,250
Understood.

355
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,490
I've won.

356
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,930
He wanted to test me, but it's backfired.

357
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,770
Black tea is my finest specialty!

358
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,720
I can make a perfect black tea fitting of a maid.

359
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,020
Head maid.

360
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,020
What kind of black tea do you have?

361
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,030
None.

362
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,060
"None"? Is that a kind of tea?

363
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,530
Nope. This shop doesn't have black tea.

364
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,530
W-What? No black tea?

365
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:17,040
Black tea and cake are the staples of a maid café!

366
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,030
Even without that,

367
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,390
if you say maid, you think English,

368
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,000
and if you say English, you think gentleman,

369
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,180
and if you say gentleman, you think black tea!

370
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,180
I don't like black tea.

371
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,180
And making black tea is annoying.

372
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,920
Do you know what character is used to write "tea" in café「喫茶店」?

373
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,850
It's the character that's in black tea「紅茶」for tea!

374
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,290
But the café in maid café means coffee, right?

375
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,660
Jeez, this back and forth...

376
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,530
I don't really know black tea either.

377
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,440
It's like little grey or something, right?

378
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,810
Those are aliens!

379
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,640
You mean Earl Grey?

380
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,100
I know another one. "No-tarin" or something like that.
(Note: ノータリン/no-tarin means idiot)

381
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,830
You're a no-tarin!

382
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,830
You probably meant to say Darjeeling.

383
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,800
The teacher's leaving no openings...

384
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,930
Rather, this shop is full of openings.

385
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,360
I don't feel like we can win.

386
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,510
I see. If we do that, we could underhandedly take that opening.

387
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,530
Arashiyama, we need an original clumsy maid performance. Anything will be fine.

388
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,040
What?

389
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,670
It's an application of your last lesson.

390
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,460
It's ok. You can do it.

391
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,200
If she manages to strike a weak point with her clumsiness...

392
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,320
There's no black tea. Please bear with coffee, teacher.

393
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,950
If she manages to strike a weak point with her clumsiness,

394
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,450
we can find our opening!

395
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,450
Go ahead.

396
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,420
If so, it would be the perfect maid skill control!

397
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,440
Ack! The coffee erupted!

398
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:37,590
Oppsie! I make a mistake and brought you cola!

399
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,320
Nice! At the very least, Arashiyama,

400
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,530
I was moved by your clumsiness.

401
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:42,950
This works!

402
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,100
I'll exchange it right away. Hehe

403
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,840
Hold up, Arashiyama.

404
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,810
Coffee is made in a coffee maker with a coffee siphon and such.

405
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:56,390
Please explain what could possibly lead to mistakenly bringing cola out.

406
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,870
Huh? Uhh

407
00:19:59,470 --> 00:19:59,920
Why?

408
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:03,730
Umm... the color is similar...

409
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:04,790
Did you do it on purpose?

410
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,970
No, uh...

411
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,920
Did you do it on purpose?

412
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,080
I did it on purpose.

413
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,150
I'm sorry.

414
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,160
She's being lectured normally.

415
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,520
Clumsiness is ineffective against the teacher?

416
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,790
Sit there for a moment, Arashiyama.

417
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,930
Uh, ok.

418
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,320
I don't know why you'd do such an illogical thing

419
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,620
but your actions are truly absurd.

420
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,530
Yes.

421
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,100
Do you even know what maids do for their occupation to begin with?

422
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,400
Is there any waiter in the world who enjoys playing tricks on their customers?

423
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,500
No, there is no such waiter.

424
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,730
Getting permission for a part time job seems uncertain, doesn't it?

425
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,900
Now that the lecture's started, Arashiyama has already won, hasn't she?

426
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,170
Speaking of which, Sanada is late...

427
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,570
Why is the homeroom teacher here?

428
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,210
This isn't a joke.

429
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:59,040
My blissful shop where I could be alone with Arashiyama...

430
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,540
has changed

431
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,160
You're always like that; writing things like 1 = 0.

432
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,570
Do your realize how these things are illogical?

433
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,890
Absurd. You are really absurd.

434
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,550
Everyone wants bliss,

435
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,380
but bliss doesn't find people.

436
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,890
If you ask why, it's because

437
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:16,900
bliss never looks for people.

438
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,880
Puppy poko poko three poko poko

439
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
Together, poko poko six poko poko~

440
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,780
Even if it is the most run down place,

441
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,030
It's a blissful shop

442
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,580
If the customer can have what they desire.

443
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,870
But no matter how the shop might glitter,

444
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,560
if the customer can't have their request fulfilled

445
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,960
The shop may as well be an empty warehouse.

446
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,680
Black tea

447
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,470
Sorry to keep you waiting

448
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,220
What's going on?

449
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,540
Welcome home, master.

450
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,990
You don't like your maid, do you?

451
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,580
Once you've opened the door, you can't escape.

452
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,150
What did you say?

453
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:14,260
C'mon, to the back.

454
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,280
Welcome. This is your shop of bliss.

455
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:20,410

459
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:37,620
Listening to explosive music with my rock soul.

ロック魂携えて 一人暮らしの 爆音人生

460
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:43,590
My pufferfish cheeks
Tennen no chouchin fugu no hoppeta de
天然の 提灯河豚のほっぺたで

461
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:47,820
Pulls the town into chaos.
Machi wo kaosu ni kyou mo makikomu
町をカオスに 今日も巻き込む

462
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:54,150
As a sign of the tsundere's intelligence
Tsundere ha interijensu no akashi nari
ツンデレは インテリジェンスの証しなり

463
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:58,970
I didn't confess to him today.
Kyou mo kare ni nazeka kokurezu
今日も彼氏に なぜか告れず

464
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:04,220
I play the drums to train
Takkyuu ni inochi wo sasage ashikoshi wo
卓球に 命を捧げ足腰を

465
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,720
My body for ping pong.
Kitaeru tame ni doramu tatakou
鍛える為に ドラム叩こう

466
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,190
But this band isn't a fake!
Konna bando demo yarase ja nee
こんなバンドでもヤラセじゃねぇ

467
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:16,140
The members aren't playing rock!
Konna memba- rokku ja nee
こんなメンバーロックじゃねぇ

468
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,200
We're not trying to lead the song!
Mezashiteruno ha ondou ja nee
目指してるのは音頭じゃねぇ

469
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:22,150
We're not looking for Nirvana!
Tadoritsuku no ha nehan ja nee!
たどり着くのは涅槃じゃねぇ！

470
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,770
We're maids! Yea!

00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,590

営業中！（めいど！ありがとうございまーす！）

481
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,290
The adults in society are the worst, complaining about sexual harassment.

482
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,330
I thought of destroying them for the good of society.

483
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,430
Isn't that too much?

484
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:03,330
I tried to tempt one but he wouldn't yield at all.

485
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:06,620
I wore sexy underwear and pulled up my skirt, you see.

486
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,540
You're unexpectedly bold.

487
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,820
And then he complained about sexual harassment.

488
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,160
What did you expect?

489
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,030
Street 2  [The Sexual Harassment Trial is Popular]
