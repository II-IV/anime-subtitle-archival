you have many good things that you can't lose in against Tatsuno.

32
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,970
Trust me, I know.

33
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,320
No good!

34
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,810
My head just decided on its own to remember Mr. Moriaki!

35
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,790
And it also manipulated the memory rather conveniently!

36
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,720
It's my well earned Sunday!

37
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,000
I shouldn't think about school or teachers.

38
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,050
I'll concentrate on this novel today and finish reading it!

39
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,780
Stop right there!

40
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,540
Take a good look.

41
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,030
What you're holding is a chikuwa stuffed with mustard.

42
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,510
You wouldn't normally confuse that sort of thing with dynamite.

43
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,290
You're the only one who could be the perpetrator!

44
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,790
No!

45
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:54,060
Why did the main character have to have the teacher's face?

46
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,320
Why...

47
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,030
Ow.

48
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,090
Sis! Let's play!

49
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,680
Sis is occupied.

50
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,710
Lies. You were just zoning out.

51
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,820
Adults also treat zoning out as work.

52
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,460
Alright. You're a good girl so

53
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,880
play with your brother, ok?

54
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,050
Takeru, play with Yukiko.

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,670
Whaa.

56
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,460
C'mon, there's something you can play together, right?

57
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,800
Something that beeps and bloops.

58
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,030
Do it please.

59
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,090
Aaah!

60
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,420
What... are you doing?!

61
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,700
I didn't get to save!

62
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,350
That hurts!

63
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:44,900
It's your fault!

64
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:45,560
Ow!

65
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,510
Mom!

66
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,540
Sis is...

67
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,350
Hotori! What are you doing?!

68
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,320
Augh, enough, enough!

69
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,900
Isn't today your day off?

70
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,170
Why did you go out of your way to come here?

71
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,060
Something terrible happened to me at home.

72
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,800
Sanada might visit, so I came here.

73
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,210
Sanada?

74
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,730
So Tatsuno is at that age...

75
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,970
Compared to her, Hotori is so...

76
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,840
Anyways Tatsuno, hear me out -

77
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,530
Recently, when I think about the teacher,

78
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,350
this part of me feels funny.

79
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,480
Oh really, Hotori too?

80
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:33,930
I know. Whenever I think about math tests, my stomach hurts.

81
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,510
Ah no, I don't mean my stomach.

82
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,140
I mean, things like differentials and integrals are beyond reason, aren't they?

83
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,670
... 7-11?

84
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,910
Differentials and integrals!

85
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,530
You can talk about difficult things, but I won't understand!

86
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,350
When I was in elementary school, I stumbled on dividing fractions.

87
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,790
If I flip the top and bottom... will that work?

88
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,460
It still makes me uneasy.

89
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,980
And you've managed to make it this far.

90
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,790
Tatsuno isn't very good at listening.

91
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,980
Though it's very Hotori like to not realize

92
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,270
the topic switched from love to math.

93
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,120
It's said that people who handle dividing fractions easily

94
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,440
will also handle their lives easily.

95
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,070
Oh!

96
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,650
 I've also seen that movie.

97
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,090
Even if you can't follow logic,

98
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,110
if you're the type that can make conversation

99
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,960
then your life will move forward smoothly.

100
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,660
There are formulas for life, huh.

101
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,620
And now we've moved to theories of life.

102
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,750
Leaving logic aside, if you can make conversation well, you'll be OK.

103
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,590
You can figure out the perpetrator in anime detective shows

104
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,420
if you follow a formula, even if you can't reason it out.

105
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,170
Really?! How?

106
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:46,090
The character voiced by the best paid voice actor is the perpetrator.

107
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,250
Augh. Now I'll always know who the perp is.

108
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,640
I shouldn't have asked.

109
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,900
Hotori, if you're free, why don't you go to the grocery store and buy some potatoes and onions?

110
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,770
But... I'm a customer today.

111
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,860
Then pay for your meal and go home.

112
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,430
Tsk. I'll go then.

113
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,530
Lend me that thing

114
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,780
that goes vroom vroom.

115
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,560
♬〜Potatoes and onions, potatoes and onions

116
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,970
♬〜Potatoes...

117
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,310
HEY!

118
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,120
Potatoes!

119
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:26,540
Onio...

120
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,610
Hey, that was dangerous!

121
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,860
What is it, jeez?

122
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:46,370
What? You stopped me for nothing?

123
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,870
Seeing dangerous people like that make me think it's Spring.

124
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,110
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S DANGEROUS!

125
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,960
I didn't hit you that hard!

126
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,260
Women don't understand the seriousness of things.

127
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,380
It's your fault for suddenly standing in front of me!

128
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,820
It's your fault!

129
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,880
I told you before to not ride on the streets, didn't I?!

130
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,070
If you don't knock it off I'm going to report this incident!

131
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,540
Don't ride on the streets?! Are you saying I should ride it in the house?!

132
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,570
My mom will get pissed off!

133
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,460
This kid...

134
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,990
So you're putting the law below your mom...

135
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,610
That's why you're a minor!

136
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,160
Listen, ok? You have no license. You have no license plate!

137
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,600
You have no headlights! You have no turn signals!

138
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,690
Due to the above reasons, you're not prepared to ride on the street.

139
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,080
It's the same as a burger without the patty, cheese, lettuce, or pickles!

140
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,050
It's a depressing burger.

141
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,800
Can I just eat the buns?

142
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,560
I can't stand this anymore.

143
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:50,780
Hmph.

144
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,260
Fine fine, I'll stop riding.

145
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,070
Huh. She's obedient today.

146
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,640
Cuz I've arrived already.

147
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,780
Milk is best with bean jam bun, poko~

148
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,110
Running errands for the hag?

149
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,900
You got a problem with grandma, punk?

150
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,990
We have good carrots today! They've just been picked! Carrots! Freshly unearthed!

151
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,820
There's still mud stuck to them. Come get 'em!

152
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,530
Be quiet! I'll forget what I came here to buy!

153
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,380
Uhh... I feel like they were ingredients for curry...

154
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,740
Ah yeah, one of them was definitely potatoes and...

155
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,280
Potatoes and...

156
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,760
Carrots please!

157
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,080
Sure, thanks for your business!

158
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,130
Oh yeah, Hotori,

159
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,770
take this with you.

160
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,820
The expiration date is tomorrow so drink it all.

161
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,210
Thank you.

162
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,050
If she drinks milk she might get a bit bigger.

163
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,560
Haha, ain't that right.

164
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,720
What did you say will get bigger?

165
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:00,660
We might have a sexual harassment case depending on your answer!

166
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,690
Cop!

167
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,150
Try not to laugh with him.

168
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:05,910
Yes!

169
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,880
I want to laugh, poko~

170
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,210
Perverted old men. I'll remember this.

171
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,120
Don't ride it. Push it home,

172
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,290
please.

173
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,310
Headlights and license plate, eh?

174
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,490
And turn signal and license!

175
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,400
Don't simplify the problem. I'll confiscate your scooter!

176
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,250
You can't handle this if I floor it.

177
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,010
Wha?

178
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,070
Let's go, Tetsuo!

179
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,890
Tetsuno isn't... wait, I told you not to ride it!

180
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,760
Jeez.

181
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,260
She'll go far away as a bride someday.

182
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,340
And then it'll be as if the town has lost its fire.

183
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,370
But right now, it seems like she's starting fires.

184
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,040
I'm back.

185
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,360
Sanada really came.

186
00:09:58,850 --> 00:09:59,360
Huh?

187
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,830
She's already back.

188
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,730
You mean she's late, right?

189
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,970
The cop said he was going to arrest me or something.

190
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,490
What did you do?

191
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,790
Depressing burger.

192
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:11,970
Wha?

193
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,540
Good job. Have some coffee?

194
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,850
I'll just have a cup please. I'm having milk.

195
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,650
Oh, so you'd like to get bigger?

196
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,330
It's too late for drinking milk to help now. You've already past your growth spurt.

197
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,370
Even if you were to get a little smaller

198
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,980
it would be nothing to worry about.

199
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,990
That's just who you are.

200
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,210
Arashiyama is Arashiyama.

201
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:41,400
You bastard! You and everyone else! Just ignore my face and talk about my boobs, huh!

202
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,880
I'm going to have a sexual harassment trial.

203
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,830
No! Objection!

204
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,940
I-I was talking about your height.

205
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,150
Yeah! Sanada isn't that kind of person!

206
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,520
Members of the audience may not speak without permission.

207
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,400
I'll be Sanada's attorney. Objection!

208
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,900
Objection denied.

209
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,320
Like I was saying, height, not boobs.

210
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,990
I said potatoes and onions...

211
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,790
You have the right to remain silent.

212
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:10,410
Anything you say can be used as evidence against you.

213
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,930
That's not a court, that's an arrest!

214
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,690
Forget the boobs, do something about her brains.

215
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,690
The popular name is "Sore Machi", poko~

[The Sign Girl is Popular] From Volume 1 Story 8

224
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,240
It's the maid greeting.

225
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,810
Why does "maid" get a Vulcan sign?

226
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,190
Wrong.

227
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,880
The Vulcan one is like this

228
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,450
Maid is like this, turning into an M.

229
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,160
If we make this our shop's greeting, we'll get more customers.

230
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,240
Nonsense!

231
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,750
What makes you say we'll get more?

232
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,770
Mai... huh?

233
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,090
 I can't do it.

234
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,210
Either way, forget it.

235
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,180
Wha?

236
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,680
But if we aren't distinctive, customers won't come.

237
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,410
Meeting in session. No one may enter.

238
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,770
Head maid! I found this...

239
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,440
Customers don't come cuz you're an idiot.

240
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,400
The world reflects one's own heart.

241
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,210
When the heart is peaceful, the world is filled with affection, but

242
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,910
when the heart is in pain,

243
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,720
the angry waves of adversity start to swirl.

244
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,910
Again.

245
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,420
There's also an arrow here.

246
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,670
Here too.

247
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,720
Yo. Aren't you the dry cleaning guy?

248
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,390
What's going on with you two?

249
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,690
For some reason there are arrows posted around town.

250
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,370
Oh. I was actually walking around and following them.

251
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,230
Is this some sort of scheme?

252
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,970
Hey, look.

253
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,870
That's grandma's place, isn't it?

254
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,980
Yo.

255
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,050
Oh my. Some bad characters again.

00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,320
Welcome hom...

257
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:02,790
Maid!

258
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,050
An inconsistent shop, eh?

259
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,830
Grandma, what's with those arrows?

260
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,230
Are you doing something?

261
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,360
What, arrows? Don't know about them.

262
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,990
Nyahaha.

263
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,740
I shall explain.

264
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,360
I spent two days around town putting up arrows

265
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,550
so customers would come following them.

266
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,750
Sometimes ninja-like.

267
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,300
Sometimes shinobi-like.

268
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,040
They're both the same.

269
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,860
Hahaha, like that would make customers come.

270
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,910
Didn't you?

271
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,240
We did.

272
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,780
Might as well stay.

273
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,980
Let's have a meeting about the festival.

274
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,240
Yeah. We've already come this far.

275
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,200
Three cold waters.

276
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,270
Yes,

277
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,310
three cold waters.

278
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,080
Yes,

279
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,970
three coffees please!

280
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,620
Three katsu curries. Alright, got it.

281
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,600
You're right here, don't play telephone!

282
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,590
Excuse me...

283
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,790
Welcome.

284
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,770
Welcome hom...

285
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,160
Maid!

286
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,970
These arrows...

287
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,080
Neheheh!

288
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,100
Another person fell into my trap!

289
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,410
Let's rename this place "Café Antlion!"

290
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,080
No.

291
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,530
So it was you after all.

292
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:20,030
What did you peel them off for, you four eyed officer

293
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,920
Megapoli!

294
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,510
You can't just go and put these up.

295
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,160
There were 30 of them.

296
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,560
I worked so hard putting them up!

297
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,250
Why do you have to be my foe?

298
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,260
I didn't mean to do that.

299
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,560
Whenever I take action for the sake of the town

300
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,160
I always run into you first.

301
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,430
You're always getting in the way of my life!

302
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,760
I can say the same to you.

303
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,260
Sorry,

304
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,610
our maid is an idiot. Here, have a cold one.

305
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,890
Chew on the ice and return to your den! Leave! Leave!

306
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,860
I can't stand this anymore.

307
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,940
Didn't we tell you not to be

308
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,610
rude to the customer?!

309
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,390
Alright?

310
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,260
Next time I don't know what'll happen.

311
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,160
I'll shoot.

312
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,600
What a stupid fool.

313
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,870
Whoa, trying to imitate Beat Takeshi.

314
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,140
Bad impression.

315
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,880
What? Try saying that again!

316
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,950
Wait! Tell me your names!

317
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:45,910
Oh? So you spent over 30 minutes chasing middle schoolers?

318
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,740
Head maid, what should we do with her?

319
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,900
There are no special considerations.

320
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,960
I'm cutting thirty minutes of pay.

321
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,020
Why? I did it very seriously.

322
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,700
If you seriously chase middle schoolers, catch them.

323
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,720
I mean before that! The original greeting and the arrows.

324
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,650
That was for the sake of getting new customers,

325
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,570
look at these never changing faces.

326
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,600
What? Do you have a complaint about your customers?

327
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,310
Aren't we helping you out by eating katsu curry at such a weird hour?

328
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,430
I won't be able to eat dinner now.

329
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,910
Why are you giving this to me? I like eating with my family.

330
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,900
Men with families are so...

331
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,550
But I kinda understand what Arashiyama is saying.

332
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,360
We've been numbed to it recently but

333
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,880
the maid café's usual customers are all from the shopping district.

334
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,630
I'd like more guys to come who enjoy maids.

335
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,170
Why do the customers have to be pleasant to the staff?

336
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,030
But Arashiyama's battle plan completely missed the mark.

337
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,990
That greeting is especially terrible.

338
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,240
Wha? Well at least we should make this place stand out more.

339
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:58,020
That's true. The sign looks like an impromptu thing.

340
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:02,320
How about putting in an order for a new sign?

341
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,610
Agreed!

342
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,380
Hotori was a crybaby, as cute as a grandchild.

343
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,420
But now she can talk about my management...

344
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,330
Oh? What's the matter, Hotori?

345
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,340
I see, I see.

346
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,620
C'mon, have some curry.

347
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,360
I couldn't give him the chocolate after all.

348
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,980
I'm such a wimp...

349
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,500
I see, I see.

350
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,950
C'mon, have some curry.

351
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:35,860
I'm crying cuz I lost my wallet.

352
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,480
I see, I see.

353
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,200
C'mon, have some curry.

354
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,430
Grandma?! What's with that outfit?!

355
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,820
What revolution is this?

356
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,690
Maid cafés seem profitable.

357
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,400
C'mon, have some curry.

358
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,900
Ate it, didn't ya Hotori. You ate it.

359
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,140
I have something to discuss.

360
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,460
Since you've eaten curry free for the past 10 years

361
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,790
you'll have to work here to pay it off your debt.

362
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,860
What?!

363
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:14,530
Hotori was a crybaby, as cute as a grandchild...

364
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,550
I agree that we should do something about the sign

365
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,310
to make our shop stand out.

366
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,260
Why don't we try something?

367
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,010
Really?

368
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,850
But what are we going to do?

369
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,260
Well, there's a giant piece of cloth on the second floor, so

370
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,530
can you make me a showy banner?

371
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,800
Things have gotten interesting!

372
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,220
You better take it seriously.

373
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,310
It's over here.

374
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,250
And there's also paint.

375
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,980
What are we gonna write?

376
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:55,760
I'll write "Maid Café Seaside" really big!

377
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,940
Do you even know how to write the characters for café?

378
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,240
I do!

379
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:01,770
Ok!

380
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,250
You talk big... but the results taper off like a tail.

381
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,280
The characters are like you.

382
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,460
Give me some paint. I'll write "Popular" in the empty space.

383
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,480
(JARO - Japan Advertisement Review Organization)
Won't JARO complain?

384
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:27,120
It'll be fine. We'll be popular after the sign goes up.

385
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:28,660
Ok!

386
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,370
Yes!

387
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:34,300
Note: She just thought of a nickname for Tatsuno when she spoke.

388
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,890
Nice Tatsun!
Note: She just thought of a nickname for Tatsuno when she spoke.

389
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,320
Sauce katsudon in milk, poko~.

390
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,640
A bit over there. Pin it down.

391
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,900
Finished!

392
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,650
Grandma, come look!

393
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,000
We worked hard on it

394
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,440
I see. Looking forward to it.

395
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,270
Note: The ない next to the sign turns popular into immature.

396
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,110
Immature...
Note: The ない next to the sign turns popular into immature.

397
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,180
Note: The ない next to the sign turns popular into immature.

398
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,840
That bastard dentist Naitou!

399
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:15,070
Seems like no matter what I do today, the world gets in my way.

400
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,490
Damn world!

401
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,110
The world reflects one's own heart.

402
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,790
When the heart is peaceful, the world is filled with affection, but

403
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:31,000
when the heart is in pain, the angry waves of adversity start to swirl.

404
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,300
I'll take this down!

405
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,520
I'll cut this down and defeat the world!

406
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,990
Arashiyama, please do that sort of thing at night.

407
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,430
This is what you need to be ninja and shinobi like for.

408
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,800
What do you mean, ninja like?

409
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,090
What are you doing to my sign?

410
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,320
Sorry.

411
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,200
I did a very immature thing...

412
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,680
If you guys were to put on shows every day

413
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,470
you might get more customers, eh?

414
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,180
In other words, when you returned to the shop

415
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,780
the victim was already collapsed here, right?

416
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,980
Suspect A: The beautiful owner of a boutique.

417
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,950
Suspect B: The taxi driver that drove her.

418
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:24,310
Suspect C: The president of an IT company who invested in the boutique.

419
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,970
The voice of the boutique owner is kinda cute and probably popular.

420
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,990
The poor looking taxi driver's voice actor has an austere voice.

421
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,580
The president definitely has a relationship with the boutique owner.

422
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,530
Err I mean, that voice seems popular too... it's a handsome voice.

423
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:45,020
Who's voiced by the best paid voice actor?

424
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:50,710
You couldn't possibly be suspecting Sachiko?

425
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,430
He's the perp!

426
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,860
Wha? How did you know?

427
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,980
He only played dead.

428
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,830
But he hasn't said anything yet. How do you know?

429
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,830
This is a rerun.

430
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,380
Mom! Sis is...

431
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,750
Hotori! What are you doing?!

432
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,350
Augh, enough, enough!

462
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,960
Now that I think about it, there's no year of the cat in the Chinese Zodiac.

463
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,220
There's also no cat constellation in the sky.

464
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,500
Why not? It's such a familiar animal.

465
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,430
Though there are cat mounds and cat promontories.

466
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,170
(Tatsu = dragon)
We have Tatsuno even though there are no dragons!

467
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:05,190
We have Tatsuno even though there are no dragons!

468
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,500
Did you forget that I'm here right now?

469
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,150
This smells like a conspiracy.

470
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:13,680
There must be a hidden truth behind why there's no cat year!

471
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:13,890
Street 3  [Cat Boy]
