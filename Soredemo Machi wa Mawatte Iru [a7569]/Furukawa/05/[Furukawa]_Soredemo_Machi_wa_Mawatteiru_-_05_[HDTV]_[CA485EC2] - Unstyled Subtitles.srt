Tatsuno Toshiko is Really Odd
Street Number 5

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,270
Even if you were to gaze at the sky at the same place,

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,640
the clouds you once saw will never be seen again.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,370
Each passing day is unavoidably engraved into the past.

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:23,260
Whoo! Tickets to the movie preview!

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,590
I think I just acted like Arashiyama.

7
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,430
Is she infecting my behavior?

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,870
Crap. I'll have to watch out.

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,110
Anyway, this will get my foot in the door!

10
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,650
Sanada and I will be together!

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:54,530
The rainbow colored twilight is falling
七色の黄昏おりてきて
Nanairo no tasogare orite kite

12
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:59,990
The wind is kinda refreshing
風はなんだか涼しげ

Saturday night is lively

The only thing that'll brighten soon are your dark emotions
暗い気持さえすぐに晴れて
Kurai kimochi sae sugu ni harete

00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,470
Everyone can't wait

Can't wait.

00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:33,200
[Tatsuno Toshiko is Unbreakable]  From Volume 1 Story 6

29
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,490
What is that?
[Tatsuno Toshiko is Unbreakable]  From Volume 1 Story 6

30
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,300
Whaa! I want to see that movie!
[Tatsuno Toshiko is Unbreakable]  From Volume 1 Story 6

31
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,020
Whaa! I want to see that movie!

32
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,860
Battles with evil syndicates!

33
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,180
Sorry, but I'm going to invite Sanada.

34
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,360
Oh?

35
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,370
But, I'm going to be so nervous when I invite him.

36
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,490
Whoa! Bittersweet, isn't it, Haribara!

37
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,320
Yup! It's adolescence, Arashiyama!

38
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,380
*sniff sniff* Refreshing!

39
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,510
Stop it.

40
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,150
But instead of a preview, why don't you just invite him to a normal movie.

41
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,880
Yeah. To a more emotional movie.

42
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,360
It doesn't matter what the movie is about.

43
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,140
If he decides to go when I invite him, I'll get my chance with him.

44
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,640
I get it.

45
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,110
When you say, "Let's go sometime," the "sometime" isn't ambiguous, is it?

46
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,660
So, she's saying because it's a preview, the date is already set?

47
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,560
Yup. That's why I picked a giveaway for an unpopular looking movie.

48
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,730
But I wanted to see it...

49
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,410
It's hard to say no to a rare event like a movie preview.

50
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,170
Just as I'd expect from Tatsuno.

51
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:32,240
You Girls

52
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,310
What are you eating during my class?
You Girls

53
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,710
What are you eating during my class?

54
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,600
Teacher, why don't you have one too?

55
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,320
Ahh! That's mean!

56
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,110
Arashiyama, I'm going to grade your work-in-progress, so show me.

57
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,170
Hey, hey, ho.

58
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,010
Oh? It's pretty good.

59
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,350
Do you get it?

60
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:03,380
It's very abstract, but the lively horse cutting through the wind comes through very clearly.

61
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,830
It's a sketch of a stretching dog...

62
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:08,990
Dog?

63
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,490
A dog.

64
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,480
Next up, Ebisu.

65
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:18,250
Huh? You don't follow? C'mon, follow me!

66
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,320
7 days left until the screening

67
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,050
Today, I'll invite him! Today, when Sanada comes to the shop,

68
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,430
I'll invite him!

69
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,970
So hot...

70
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,360
What kind of getup is that?!

71
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,380
How are you a maid?!

72
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,900
You have no shame in front of others!

73
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,440
Why are you freaking out all of a sudden?!

74
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,680
Try and see what you can do, poko~

75
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,300
It's because these clothes are so stuffy.

76
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,250
Grandma, make us some summer outfits.

77
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,700
Summer outfits, huh?

78
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,370
Well, if I spend all night I might be able to sew one outfit...

79
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,060
Oh, then... tomorrow, the day after...

80
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,640
We'll have three outfits for everyone three days from now!

81
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,550
If you make the Head Maid work overnight for three days you'll kill her!

82
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,760
No way!

83
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,790
3 days left until the screening

84
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,500
Al--right

85
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,980
Damn, pretty good hit.

86
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,410
If I could just get him going with an Arashiyama-like smile...

87
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,970
Wait, I only have three more days! I have to do it today. Today...

88
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,280
If I don't invite him today...

89
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,410
Hey! Did you ask him on a date yet?

90
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,020
I'm gonna do it right now. Watch me.

91
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,630
A personality like yours is something special, isn't it?

92
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,510
You'd be like that towards someone you like too.

93
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,990
I'm taking you to the movies!

94
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,580
You'd say something like that.

95
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,300
Let's go! This is it!

96
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,340
Sanada?

97
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,410
A movie...

98
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,890
Um, movie...

99
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,820
Movi... mov...

100
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,040
Get moving and finish cleaning or you'll be sorry.

101
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,860
Yes! A sorry girl!

102
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,770
Sanada is going home... is that ok?

103
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,480
You can catch up if you run.

104
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,110
Wan-na go see a mo-vie ?

105
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,810
It would've been just eight characters even with a question mark, so why couldn't I say it?

106
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,020
Want me to ask for you?

107
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,410
No. I'll go.

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,340
How could I be happy that someone would go in my place, even for a moment?

109
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,430
I'm going to...

110
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,850
jump these...

111
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,590
six steps!

112
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,470
Ack! Kameda from Western History!

113
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,860

119
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:23,980
This is bad.

120
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,210

124
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,960
Once he starts lecturing,

125
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,140
Western History Teacher Kameda just doesn't stop.

126
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,380
Note: Kame = Turtle. Apparently softshell turtles can be very aggressive.
His nickname is "Softshell Kameda."

127
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,790
Y-You!

128
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,020
If it were Arashiyama in a situation where she'd pissed someone off...

129
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,570
she'd absentmindedly escape.

130
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,920
What would Arashiyama say?

131
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,870
What would Arashiyama do?

132
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,210
How would she escape this?

133
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,230
No! No! No!

134
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,980
What would "I" do?

135
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,190
I'd...

136
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,730
Apologies, Mr. Kameda.

137
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,540
I slipped on the stairs...

138
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,950
but I'll be alright.

139
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,320
O-Oh I see. Be careful.

140
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:22,760
I will.

141
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,450
Excuse me.

142
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,110
The day of the screening

143
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:33,720
Huh? Weren't you going to the movies with the kid from the fish market today?

144
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,840
Rather than doing more work,

145
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,710
doing less work is more effective.

146
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,970
That's the sort of tactic I'm using.

147
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,980
Huh? What are you talking about?

148
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,480
Ah. That's what you mean.

149
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,050
Well, I'll leave things to you.

150
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,460
Huh? What about the shop?

151
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:05,480
I'm going to play Pachinko, so I'll leave you in the care of the maid today.

152
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,100
In order to succeed,

153
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,500
one must first exert some effort towards getting the reward.

154
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,340
Welcome.

155
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,270
However, very rarely...

156
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,580
Whoo! Free movie ticket!

157
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,990
doing nothing at all

158
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,640
results in great success for those lucky individuals.

159
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,690
Sneezes show a person's true nature, poko~

160
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:39,840
You see, detectives require sharp observational and investigative skills.

161
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,930
In Japan, a detective's profession...

162
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:47,700
is about being hired to watch the target's movements and discreetly sleuth around for their secrets.

163
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,840
The ones who are truly talented can find work.

164
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,810
I'm going to observe and investigate you, sis!

165
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,360
Alright, alright, renowned detective Yukiko.

166
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,220
Try finding the <i>truth</i> about me.

167
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,820
Ay, ay, sir!

168
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,710
Huh?

169
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,710
No chest or narrow waist.

170
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,760
It's a <i>truth</i> about sis.

171
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:20,510
Looks like you have a pretty good eye for observations.

172
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,390
You can eat pill-bugs, poko~

173
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,910
But they taste terrible, poko~

179
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,580
Four damage.

180
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,520
Zombie detective defeated.

181
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,580
However, when the zombie detective dies,

182
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,000
an enemy of the same or lower level goes with him.

183
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,560
O-Oh no! Fairy defeated!

184
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,320
And now, I'll make a direct attack on Maki!

185
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,570
I'll protect myself with a turtle knight!

186
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,740
Pointless.

187
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,530
I have a spear so it'll pass a single monster guard.

188
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,440
Damn.

189
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,000
Remaining hit points: Zero. I'm dead.

190
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,300
I've lost.

191
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,850
Takeru is good!

192
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,090
Super good!

193
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,000
Ridiculously good even though your cards are shabby.

194
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,550
You could win against Yamamoto in class 4.

195
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,520
Let's go play him at recess.

196
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,110
Excuse me, boys.

197
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,130
Is it alright for you to bring that to school?

198
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,390
Yeah!

199
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,190
Shut up, Isei Ebi.

200
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,470

00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,630
I'll tell them about this at next week's student council meeting.

205

Let's go, Ebi.

206
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,310
You're getting more and more annoying, Isei Ebi.

207
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,980
Girls are annoying.

208
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,240
At this point, why did Hans suddenly escape?

209
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,600
Do we understand what he felt at that time?

210
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,940
Is there anyone who knows?

211
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,950
Ebi

Can I come hang out at
 your place on Saturday?

212
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,750
It'll be on the test.

Huh?

216
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,140
No way.

217
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,420
She won't actually come, right?

218
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,490
No way she'd come.

219
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,630
Oh, sorry. The bathroom is open now.

220
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,420
Nah, I'm not waiting for the bathroom.

221
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,280
Excuse me!

222
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,090
Ehh?

223
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,990
Iseisaki.

224
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,410
Hello.

225
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,030
Oh my, well, good day.

226
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,970
So you were waiting for your friend.

227
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,450
I wasn't waiting and she isn't my friend!

Huh... you really came.

230
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,470
Iseisaki, what did you come here for?

231
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,420
I said to hang out, didn't I?

232
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,090
Oh, right.

233
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,480

Hol... Hold on.

Sure.

Wait,

266
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,740
 why are you calling me by my first name?

267
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,090
You always call me Arashiyama-kun.

Wha?

269
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,700
 That's my own business.

270
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,850
Takeru-kun, you should also call me by my first name.

271
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,760
Oh yeah, Iseisaki-san, what was your first name?

272
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:24,020
Huh?

273
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,090
What? Sorry! I just forgot.

274
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,540
I'll remember it right now.

What?

00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:36,490
ERI!

Eh?

Eeeh! No, no, no!

285
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,580
I can't even read the first names of girls in mangas without being embarrassed.

286
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,100
This is impossible.

287
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,990
Can I call you Ebi-chan instead?

288
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,040
That's how I call girls.

289
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,850
Well, okay.

290
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,090
Hey, want ice cream?

291
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,240
Eh, I'm fine. And it's cold.

292
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,680
I want to eat it! Buy some!

293
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,710
Note: Boku and Ore both mean "I" (first person pronoun). Ore is a more masculine version.
Also, I hate the word "Boku." Say "Ore."

294
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,310
So arbitrary...

295
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,180
What flavor do you want?

296
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,030
Vanilla.

297
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,690
Uhh...

298
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,720
nothing.

299
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,630
What flavors are there?

300
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,880
There's everything but vanilla.

301
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,010
Then, strawberry.

302
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,980
Sorry, there wasn't any.

303
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,840
Also, I feel like I'm going to freeze to death.

304
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,470
Well, pick something you like, Takeru-kun.

305
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,280
You got me a chocolate melon!

306
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,020
Y-Yeah.

307
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,630
It was at the top.

308
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,790
Thanks.

309
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:54,910
Yo, Takeru.

310
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,440
What's this? A date?

311
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,120
Hey, hey, hey, you're doin' pretty well.

312
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,460
You got it wrong. Wrong.

313
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,300
Um...

314
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:05,950
Oh.

315
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,980
This is one of sis's friends.

316
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,490
Hello.

317
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,070
Hello.

318
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,660
Ain't she a cutie?

319
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,890
Good luck!

320
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,350
Like I said, good luck with what?

321
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,470
Sorry for interrupting.

322
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:20,810
 See ya.

323
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,000
She's pretty.

324
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,550
Y-Yeah.

325
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,100
I thought the guys found me.

326
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,910
The chances of an encounter in the shopping district are too high.

327
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,590
I need to find some place to hide.

328
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,320
Iseisaki-san,

329
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,210
(boku)
Ebi-chan, I...

330
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,740
(ore)
Want to visit the store I usually go to?

331
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,360
Oh? What is it? I'll go.

332
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,340
So I get punched if I say the forbidden words...

333
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,450
Isn't this oppression of free speech?

334
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,810
Welcome.

335
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,210
Hello.

336
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,850
My, Takeru! A date?

337
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,390
And I guess this is what they call a false accusation.

338
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,320
Wow!

339
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,830
This is the first time I've been in a place like this.

340
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,140
I've always wanted to visit a cheap sweets shop.

341
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,560
Ah, this.

342
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,830
The cards that boys gather around. {tl'd literally}

343
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,740
I'll have this, please.

344
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,550
That's 1,500,000 yen,

345
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,550
but you can have it for 150 yen.

346
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,980
Uh. Thank you.

347
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,380
Augh. I got the worst. Crap.

348
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,890
Want to buy cards?

349
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,020
I'll just buy one.

350
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,100
Worst case scenario!

351
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,010
I didn't know they still had something left from their monthly allowance.

352
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,880
No place to run. No possible excuse.

353
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,850
My elementary school life is over.

354
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,860
Oh, those guys!

355
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,110
Takeru, hide in the VIP room.

356
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:05,890
Can I?

357
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:12,270
Elementary schoolers usually can't enter.
A place for eating monjayaki.
The refreshing candy shop VIP room...

358
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,370
Mamo, did you see Takeru?

359
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:14,850
Hm?

360
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:15,700
Yikes!

361
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,430
We checked out his house but he wasn't there.

362
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,950
Takeru might have entered the adult world.

363
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,950
Huh? Where?

364
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,840
Let's check out the temple.

365
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,120
That close call was like something out of a movie.

366
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,770
If I don't give up, then I just might survive.

367
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,370
Takeru-kun,

368
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,060
have this.

369
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,850
Eh? Can I?

370
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:44,860
Yeah.
Eh? Can I?

371
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,550
Yeah.

372
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,590
Open it.

373
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,050
Ok.

374
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,990
A-A little close.

375
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,240
Any strong ones in there?

376
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,310
There's nothing but worthless cards in here.

377
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,860
So are they strong?

378
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,180
Yeah, depending on how you use them.

379
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,910
Makki wanted this one.

380
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,200
If I trade this with a Kabayan...

381
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,380
Takeru-kun,

382
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,900
treasure those, okay?

383
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,840
Ah, sure.

384
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,650
Don't trade them or anything.

385
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:17,440
Sure.

386
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,710
She's pretty different than at school.

387
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,380
What?

388
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,560
(boku)
I, err

389
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,400
I won't use these cards.
(ore)

390
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,700
Why?! Aren't they strong?

391
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,900
I won't know which ones these are if I mix them with the others.

392
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,720
Takeru is doing pretty well.

393
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,730
C'mon, grab on.

394
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,320
Good, good!

395
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,640
I'm gonna let go.

396
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,350
No, you can't let go yet!

397
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:55,030
Kids these days, making out and missin' lunch.

398
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,490
Oh, but I like that girl.

399
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,450
She can greet people properly.

400
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,700
I wasn't saying anything bad about anyone...

401
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,170
Tell those two outside that it's lunchtime.

402
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,490
Okay.

403
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,680
By the way, what about my lunch?

404
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,660
Eat with the kids.

405
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,250
You'll fit right in with grade schoolers.

406
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,040
What do you mean by that?

407
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,000
But, Hotori is going to eat with the kids anyway.

408
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,460
Lunch.

409
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,780
The next morning

410
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,810
Hey, Takeru.

411
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:28,860
Morning.

412
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,230
Where did you go yesterday, Takeru?

413
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,120
Uhh, I dropped by a relative's place.

414
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,380
Makita, look.

415
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,720
At what?

416
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,190
Whoa, that's awesome.

417
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,180
Morning, Ebi-chan.

418
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,160
Don't call me Ebi-chan, okay?

419
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:01,290
Huh?

420
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,070
(ore)
(boku)
I, err, did I do something?

421
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,360
Cozy, cozy!

422
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,990
Sorry, sorry, were you watching?

423
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,580
Look, it's not over yet.

424
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,110
I wanna see the transformation!

425
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,300
They transform every week.

426
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,130
Woman are...

427
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,820
incomprehensible.

428
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,630
Wahahaha! Takeru just said something hilarious!

429
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,470
Memo! Memo...

00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,980

432
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:55,700
The Japanese detective has the occupation of uncovering illegal conduct in civil affairs.

433
00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:00,880
In such cases, punishment by law is determined by the police.

434
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:04,330
Alright. Have you discovered the <i>truth</i> about me?

435
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,840
Yes. I've discovered the <i>truth</i>.

436
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,230
Right here!

00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,740
This is full of things no one knows...

440
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,810
You win, you win! Excellent job, renowned detective.

Next episode

471
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,740
There's an old story about Pandora's box.

472
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,070
I know that one. It's the box that you shouldn't open, right?

473
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,780
If opened, a lot of bad things come flying out.

474
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:01,480
But the very last thing that came out was <i>hope</i>.

475
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,010
But really, <i>hope</i> is just a trap.

476
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,270
If there were no <i>hope</i>, you'd just give up

477
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,550
instead of reaching for the stars and telling yourself you'll win next time.

478
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,690
