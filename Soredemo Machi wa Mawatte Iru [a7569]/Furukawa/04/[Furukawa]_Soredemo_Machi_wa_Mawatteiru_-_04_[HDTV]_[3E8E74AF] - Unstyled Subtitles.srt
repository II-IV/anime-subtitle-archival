1
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,780
Alright, all done.

2
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,820
Looks a bit cleaner now.

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,200
What's the occasion? Are you expecting someone?

4
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,440
I'm not expecting anyone, but someone might come!

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,720
Someone like Mr. Moriaki...

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:22,620
Oh yeah?

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,220
But it's hopeless. Still haven't given up?

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,460
Well, I was watching the horoscopes on TV this morning,

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,870
and on the weekly love forecast,

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,420
it said that my true love will soon come by!

11
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,450
On channel 6.

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,220
Channel 6?

13
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,860
I was channel surfing and looking at various horoscopes.

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,700
And the last one I saw was my true fortune!

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,120
Just the other day,

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,610
I saw my first fortune, but it was kinda lame...

17
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,520
so I checked out another channel,

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,570
and it kept scrolling down till it got to the very last one, the 13th zodiac sign.

19
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,280
The 13th zodiac sign is still around?

20
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,020
This "Ophiuchus" sign is kinda sketchy, you know?

21
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,340
As a Sagittarius, I'd be a romantic and a reliable hard worker.

22
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,300
But as an Ophiuchi, I'd have the energy to do things,

23
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,980
but then I'd also say a lot of rude things.

24
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,820
She's an Ophiuchi!

25
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,640
Jeez, you always look so happy every day.

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,490
Is that what I look like?

27
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,830
Maybe this whole deal about meeting the one I'm destined to be with is about Mr. Moriaki?

28
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,220
Couldn't your destined person be anybody?

29
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,320
Like a sworn enemy, or a rival, or a natural born enemy... {Find another word for Natural Enemy} {tl: predator prey relationship}

30
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,980
Why would a love fortune talk about my natural born enemy?! {same here}

31
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,220
Oh, you're gonna be close to Mr. Moriaki!

32
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,130
Extra lessons?!

33
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,450
Isn't it great?

34
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,580
The fortune was right.

35
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:04,500
The rainbow colored twilight is falling
七色の黄昏おりてきて
Nanairo no tasogare orite kite

36
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,960
The wind is kinda refreshing
風はなんだか涼しげ
Kaze ha nandaka suzushige

37
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,590
Saturday night is lively

40

Can't wait.

50
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,940
Equations.

51
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:40,420
Just by giving variables specific values, the value of each side can be determined.

52
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,640
These specific values are the keys to the equation.

53
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,560
Right now, before my eyes...

54
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,710
lies my second natural born enemy.

55
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,370
Now that I think about it, my first natural born enemy was in 2nd grade,

56
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,910
the homeroom teacher.

57
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,130
When people read a book,

58
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,210
each person has a different impression of it.

59
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:12,480
Literature is interesting because there are as many opinions as there are people.

60
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,300
On the other hand,

61
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,800
every math problem has only one right answer.

62
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,150
That's what makes math interesting.

63
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,780
I get it! So I guess I like math.

64
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,460
Huh?

65
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,750
We were just in the middle of dividing,

66
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,060
but now we can't divide any further.

67
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,350
What are we going to do now?

68
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,670
She's right! What's gonna happen now?

69
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,320
We can't do anything about the remainder,

70
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,780
so we write the remaining 5 over here.

71
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,090
Teacher!

72
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,070
What is it, Moriaki?

73
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,810
Umm, I mean... stopping in the middle like that...

74
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,310
is that really ok?

75
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,820
Well... it's annoying, isn't it?

76
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,540
However, there's nothing we can do.

77
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,550
What would you do, Moriaki?

78
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,770
I don't know.

79
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,840
But teacher,

80
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,220
you said that we shouldn't leave leftovers at lunch,

81
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,600
so why should we leave leftovers while dividing?

82
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,620
Yeah.

83
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,150
Moriaki's right.

84
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:22,280
Yes. It was hard to say, but everyone agrees with me!

85
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,970
You're right that stopping before we've finished is bad,

86
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,360
but when you get a persimmon for lunch, don't you leave the seeds?

87
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,120
The remainder from dividing is just like those seeds.

88
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,130
Sit down already!

89
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,480
You're so stupid. Do you eat persimmon seeds?

90
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,190
Who's the idiot here?

91
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,900
This incident left a huge impression on the rest of my life.

92
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,250
As a result...

93
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,510
I became a math teacher.

94
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:00,640
That homeroom teacher was my very first natural born enemy.

95
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:01,750
And now,

96
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,000
before me,

97
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,500
sits my second natural born enemy.

98
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,990
Umm, I'm not sure,

99
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,430
but am I the only one getting extra lessons?

100
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,180
The only one who got zeros on both the main exam,

101
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,830
and the retake was you, Arashiyama Hotori.

102
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,170
Oh yeah? Oh yeah.

103
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,160
Well, whatever!

104
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,570
Since it's just the two of us, I'll just think of it as a date!

105
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,450
My stomach is starting to hurt even sooner than I expected.

106
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,770
Arashiyama Hotori,

107
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,150
as a teacher, I think it's important to have morals.

108
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,120
I like to have some level of
consideration toward my students,

109
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,500
so instead of saying what I'd like to say to you now...

110
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,260
I will be very grateful if you could guess what I want to say.

111
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,470
For some reason, I just made a pretty good guess.

112
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,390
Very well. Please listen then.

113
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,240
This is about when I was grading these tests.

114
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,260
And next up is...

115
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,920
Arashiyama?!

116
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,730
It happens every time.

117
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,360
When it's Arashiyama's turn, I get a sinking feeling in my stomach.

118
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,560
She blatantly gives up while answering the question,

119
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,930
and just writes some answer without the work.

120
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,270
Naturally, the answer is wrong.

121
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,230
Every time I see it, I get sharp pains in my stomach.

122
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:37,910
But then when I saw all the mistakes that the answers were derived from, my head started pounding.

123
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,870
And then...

124
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,800
If you don't get it just leave the space blank!

125
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,700
Finally, on the answer sheet, just when I thought I found something marked correct...

126
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,460
it turned out to be the zero.

127
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,060
Arashiyama's answer sheet was, without a doubt, an attempt on my life.

128
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:11,940
This was clearly a plan to commit murder!

129
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,820
No!

130
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,720
You love dramatic things like this, don't you?

131
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,010
What's most unforgivable, is that your grades in other subjects haven't changed.

132
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,360
Given that, you must have an ulterior motive.

133
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:33,100
That's because math has nothing to do with detectives, right?

134
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,360
Detectives?

135
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,130
I'm just an ordinary high school girl right now,

136
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,870
but one day,

137
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,640
I'll be a high school detective girl!

138
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,260
One day? How long do you intend on being a high schooler?

139
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,580
More importantly,

140
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,910
at this rate you're going to be held back,

141
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,630
so your dream might just come true.

142
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:57,010
There's no reason why we couldn't have a 20+ year old high school detective girl.

143
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,390
Let's have some lessons to avoid that.

144
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,600
Now, solve the problem.

145
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,360
Good.

146
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,110
Teacher!

147
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,840
What? That was quick.

148
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,980
What's this?

149
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,650
Do you know how this iron ball got into the house?

150
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,290
This has all the necessary information, right?

151
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,960
Absolutely!

152
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,650
The diameter of the ball is fixed at all angles.

153
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,270
Next to it, the sides of the rectangle are also all fixed in length.

154
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,690
Given this, the ball shouldn't be able to pass through the narrow door.

155
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,060
This is impossible.

156
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,890
You see, the answer is...

157
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,940
the ball wasn't put through the door,

158
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,070
but rather the house was built around the iron ball!

159
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,380
It's important to think outside of the box like this in real life.

160
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:05,830
It lets you find the answer faster than math...

161
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,050
Corn is delicious, poko~

162
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,240
What's going on, Hotori? You're reading your textbook.

163
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,800
How rare. It'd be more believable if you got struck by lightning.

164
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,070
I've already been struck by lightning.

165
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,700
At this rate, I'm gonna be a high school girl for the rest of my life.

166
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,390
I'm jealous.

167
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,900
Moriaki got pissed at me.

168
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,400
Of course he'd be pissed if you showed him this brain teaser.

169
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,150
He's super square.

170
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,700
If you want to know how square he is,

171
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,660
I heard a story about him from another teacher.

172
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:47,410
Once, there was a high school girl who loved Mr. Moriaki.

173
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,540
She was said to be pure, innocent maiden.

174
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,790
That girl sounds just like me!

175
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,730
Every bit about pure and innocent!

176
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,320
What?

177
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,980
One day she put everything she felt into a love letter,

178
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,270
and handed it to Mr. Moriaki.

179
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,060
The next day, she received a reply letter.

180
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,110
W-What did it say?

181
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,940
I want to know! Ahh, but I'm scared too.

182
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,360
My maiden heart is shaking nervously. Trembling.

183
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,980
There was just one equation written.

184
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,420
It was an equation that meant love cannot happen...

185
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,330
given the moral values between teacher and student.

186
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,390
The high school girl was so heartbroken,

187
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,260
that the principal came to know about it.

188
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,920
Now that sounds like you.

189
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,760
However, the principal...

190
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,080
We've had nothing but shameless teachers till yesterday...

191
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,940
Mr. Moriaki is a true model of a teacher!

192
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:53,420
He was so moved that the letter still hangs in the principal's office to this day.

193
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,400
And everyone lived happily ever after.

194
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,520
That wasn't happy at all!

195
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,400
The laws are very strict about this.

196
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,860
If you don't study properly you're really gonna be held back.

197
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,350
She's just like her.

198
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,210
My two natural born enemies have the same personalities.

199
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,270
They deceive me by talking about things unrelated to math.

200
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,960
And for some reason, I think they had the same face.

201
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,710
Could it be? Did a grown up Hotori

202
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,600
timeslip into the past and become my homeroom teacher?

203
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:27,850
No.

204
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,090
No way.

205
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,960
I don't believe in Sci-Fi or the occult.

206
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,050
I'm a math teacher.

207
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,820
Hmm... Oh,

208
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,620
I got it!

209
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,040
Show me. I'll check your answers.

210
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,610
What the heck?

211
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,840
It disproves the other equation.

212
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,000
I'll use it at the next after-school lesson.

213
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,000
You're really going to stay back a year.

214
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,870
Equations.

215
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,370
The variables in these equalities are the keys to finding the answer.

216
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,420
But sometimes, the right answer is to say there is no answer.

217
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,610
Mr. Moriaki, here's your coffee.

218
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,520
Thank you very much.

219
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,580
One for you too, Mr. Kameda.

220
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,070
Thanks for the coffee.

221
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,880
A long time ago, it was said that if you put milk in your coffee,

222
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,830
you'd see the initials of the person you're thinking of on the surface.

223
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,680
You're more of a romantic than you look, Mr. Kameda.

224
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:35,840
More than I look?
You're more of a romantic than you look, Mr. Kameda.

225
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,280
More than I look?

226
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,590
Hmmm, if I try, I think I can see "N. M."

227
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,110
"N. M." in Natsuhiko Moriaki, that is.

228
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,090
I see.

229
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,980
I can see Pi in mine.

230
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,140
Whoa. He ignored what I said about "N. M."

231
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,780
That's not an initial at all.

232
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,450
Maybe it means I love Pi.

233
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,800
Well, I do like it.

234
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,500
What do you see, Mr. Kameda?

235
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,190
If I don't get God's initials, things are going to be pretty bad.

236
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,320
Curse?!

237
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:13,330
What? The chair just abruptly fell.

238
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,700
The height adjustment lever is broken.

239
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,360
Oh well.

240
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,680
It sinks if I put my weight into it.

241
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,000
The desk next to me is unused.

242
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,370
Why don't you swap with this chair?

243
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,130
Let me do that.

244
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,260
Been unlucky all morning, huh?

245
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,510
Guess that "curse" initial was...

246
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,840
Don't say that, Ms. Nishi.

247
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,600
 It's not even an initial.

248
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,730
Hey honey, something's wrong.

249
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,700
Hotori is putting something on her face!

250
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,430
The weather's getting dry, so I told her to put some lotion on.

251
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,930
Oh? She's getting a bit more feminine.

252
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,100
I don't know about that.

253
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,980
She doesn't put on any lipstick. Not quite feminine yet.

254
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,200
What! What's wrong?!

255
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,220
My eyes... my eyes... my face burns.

256
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,840
And now it's chilly.

257
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,380
What did you put on?

258
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,680
The bottle shapes look similar, so you used the wrong one...

259
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,260
You're a jerk, Dad!

260
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,380
Why do we have hair growth tonic when you're not even bald?

261
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,380
Fool! I'm not bald because I have hair growth tonic!

262
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,670
It stings... I can't go to school today since I can't open my eyes.

263
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,740
Don't say stupid things like that!

264
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,920
...and that's why I'm here so late.

265
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,260
Very well.

266
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,020
But you just have one reason after another for being late.

267
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,010
The truth is stranger than fiction, as they say.

268
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,700
Having to put stinging stuff on their heads...

269
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,260
must be rough for men, you know?

270
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,980
Teacher, is your hair doing alright?

271
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,260
Yes, but no thanks to you.

272
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,210
If I start losing my hair to stress though, it'll be your fault.

273
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,600
Blaming someone else?!

274
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,940
You don't look sorry at all.

275
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,120
Class is starting so take a seat.

276
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,720
We'll continue this conversation later.

277
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,550
Please stay after school.

278
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,160
Hmm... well, I've done something like that.

279
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,160
I've tried brushing my teeth with face wash cream before.

280
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,990
Nehehe! You're such a ditz!

281
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,520
Who are you to say that?!

282
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
She snapped.

283
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,210
I was just continuing the conversation. Why would you call me a ditz?

284
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:34,510
Well, once you put something that nasty in your mouth, you won't make the same mistake again.

285
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,280
So you've made that mistake before.

286
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,380
What the heck?

287
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,270
Being summoned for being late? Are you a middle schooler?

288
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,020
So he was serious about me staying after school.

289
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,130
Because, Moriaki is a strict math teacher, you know.

290
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,500
If you want to know how square he is...

291
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,480
The story about the love letter?

292
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,450
I heard it from Tatsun before.

293
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:01,660
Love can't happen given the moral values between teacher and student.

294
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,000
I know how that story continues.

295
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:04,790
There's more?

296
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,730
About five or six years passed, and that high school girl

297
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,210
managed to become a teacher at this school.

298
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,200
However, it seems like they didn't fall in love.

299
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,300
You have to know when to give up, poko~

300
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,180
Wow, the weather's great today.

301
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,610
Let's get home before it gets dark. Go, go.

302
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:37,720
I was going to act all natural and escape,

303
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,410
but I couldn't fool you...

304
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,820
I remembered because that was completely unnatural.

305
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,560
I have to go to work, so make it quick please.

306
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,400
That's your problem.

307
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,780
As a teacher,

308
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,890
I just thought of something unbecoming of me.

309
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:01,320
I can get some refreshing revenge on Arashiyama for stressing me out all day.

310
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,540
If I can get her to sit on the broken chair...

311
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,040
it'll startle her a bit.

312
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,710
What am I talking about?

313
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,800
I didn't know I had such a sense of humor.

314
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,630
What's going on, Ms. Nishi?

315
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,280
Sorry, I spilled some coffee.

316
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,750
But it's all cleaned up now.

317
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,950
Oh, I see.

318
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,730
I don't know which chair is the broken one!

319
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:42,340
Regrettably, I'll have to give up on my plan to scare Arashiyama.

320
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,370
Wait, but that means...

321
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,500
I don't know which chair I should sit on!

322
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,310
Light offense style.

323
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,270
Moderate offense style.

324
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,930
Severe offense style.

325
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,770
No matter what style,

326
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,140
I have to sit on a chair.

327
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,280
If the chair breaks while Arashiyama is looking...

328
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,960
Undoubtedly, my dignity will break too.

329
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,840
Which chair is the broken one?

330
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,080
Pushing down them with my hands won't be enough.

331
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,180
If I had known, I would've marked the chair this morning.

332
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,180
Give up on lecturing her today!

333
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,530
Are you going to run from teaching her?

334
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,790
Okay, I'm going to sit.

335
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,550
Right. Go ahead.

336
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,200
Damn! She doesn't get what I'm feeling.

337
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:47,010
But I just realized, Pi "π" looks like Death "死"...

338
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,700
How ominous.

339
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:53,370
Get a hold of yourself! There's no such thing as an omen or destiny.

340
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:59,130
The only certainty is the 33.3333 percent chance that the chair will sink.

341
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,340
What are you doing?

342
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,030
N-Nothing.

343
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,850
Okay, Arashiyama. I'm going to sit.

344
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,230
So you're going to sit too.

345
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,180
Uh, okay.

346
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,990
No hard feelings.

347
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,850
Huh?

348
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,790
Teacher, you're acting weird.

349
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,780
You're mumbling stuff like 33 percent or something.

350
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,670
Ah, uhh...

351
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,300
I mean, within the span of a month,

352
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,140
you've been late 33 percent of the time.

353
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,180
Yeah.

354
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,800
That's not true! It's been twice per week, at most.

355
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,910
So Arashiyama is bad at both math and arithmetic.

356
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,540
Huh? So there's six days of school per week...

357
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,380
and I'm late on two of them, so...

358
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,240
Jeez, weren't we talking about being late?

359
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,070
Why are we talking about math problems now?

360
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,990
She's putting my class on the same level as basic arithmetic.

361
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,370
No! I managed to escape the sinking chair,

362
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,240
so I can't sink into depression now.

363
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,900
For Arashiyama's sake too, I'll say it clearly.

364
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,880
As a teacher, I'm going to sternly...

365
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,880
After this, preserving the teacher's dignity...

366
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,110
will be 100% impossible.

367
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:42,780
It's not pasta, it's spaghetti, poko~

368
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,760
Sis, you still look at fortunes?

369
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,010
Quiet!

370
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,550
<i>Watch out for love troubles.</i>

371
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:51,600
Lame.
<i>Watch out for love troubles.</i>

372
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,580
Lame.

373
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:57,370
<i>Today's Taurus fortune: Your academic luck is low.</i>

374
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,380
<i>Don't fall asleep during the exam!</i>

375
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,670
Also lame.

376
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,880
<i>Today's 13 fortunes!</i>

377
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,320
<i>Today's Aries fortune: Terrible financial luck.</i>

378
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,190
No, no, this is no good.

379
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,060
...and that's why I'm late.

380
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,520
Incomprehensible...

381
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:19,910

382
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:20,350

387

Living alone is boring,

388

I didn't confess to him today.
Kyou mo kare ni nazeka kokurezu

393
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,160
卓球に 命を捧げ足腰を

410
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,860
Hey, don't you think Tatsun is odd?

411
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,110
She's definitely a bit odd.

412
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,400
I don't know how to put it, but... isn't it odd?

413
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,380
Whether she's odd or odd isn't that odd,

414
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,110
but oddly, she has odd things about her.

415
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,150
They're all odd, aren't they?

416
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,120
What's odd about me?!

417
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,990
You can't put it into words?

418
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,840
Not really.

419
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,590
Next time: Street number 5 "Tatsuno Toshiko is really odd"

420
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,190
We're all over sometimes, poko~
