only innocence.

One will learn eventually.

00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,530

23
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,960
How did you know?

24
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,070
You've taken a step back with a hand over your agape mouth.

25
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,440
So detailed!

26
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,680
The Guardian Spirit told me.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,120
Shizuka, when did you get such powers?!

28
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,380
Just kidding.

29
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,730
A mirror.

30
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,710
You were looking through the glass.

31
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,540
Such an elementary trick... but you couldn't see through it.

32
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,740
You couldn't even be my assistant.

33
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,190
I came today to get a present for Tatsun's birthday.

34
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,620
To a second hand goods shop...

35
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,340
Huh?

36
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,590
This scale...

37
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,410
I have the perfect amount of sugar for this coffee.

38
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,770
This could work!

39
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,350
Note: 6500 yen is currently about $78.85.

40
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,640
But it's expensive.
Note: 6500 yen is currently about $78.85.

41
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:15,670
Note: 6500 yen is currently about $78.85.

42
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,530
Shizuka, is this good?

43
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,390
What a vague question.

44
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,520
Well, it's certainly...

45
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:32,000
The ranchu goldfish is the pride of Japan, poko~

46
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,470
So, buying it?

47
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,240
No discount?!

48
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:38,980
Oh yeah.

49
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,430
Changing the topic...

50
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,330
I visited Africa a few days ago.

51
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,810
Oh. So that's why you're wearing those weird clothes.

52
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,890
It comes out of the walls, poko~

53
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,290
Here. Your souvenir.

54
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,820
Yay! I'm so happy!

55
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,000
What the hell is this?!

56
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,110
Repugnant! Revolting! Repulsive! The three 'R's!

57
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,920
Those three 'R's...

58
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,050
Really just mean the same thing, right?

59
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,760
Somehow...

60
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,940
A wealthy local tried to get me to marry him,

61
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,740
and gave me his family's heirloom mask.

62
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,600
Anyway, with the mask's power

63
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,640
you can find out where you should be.

64
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,140
Ahhh, I don't want it...

65
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,720
Now, now.

66
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,120
Think of it as a matchmaking charm.

67
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,490
Stop it...

68
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,360
I just thought of a present for Tacchan!

69
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,640
It's Tatsun.

70
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,460
It's something romantic.

71
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,480
See ya!

72
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,700
I feel like I've been used to get rid of some trash.

73
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,230
What is that?!

74
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,170
Mice actually hate cheese, poko~

75
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,970
It's two days early, but...

76
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,540
Happy Birthday!

77
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,530
Thanks. I haven't had a birthday party like this since elementary school.

78
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,170
This is a little something from my place.

79
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,350
It's a dish called Fresh Sea Salad.

80
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,640
Thank you! I'll take good care of it!

81
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,870
No, you should eat it right away.

82
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,400
In other words,

83
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,550
this is a Sanada Sakana Salad?

84
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,000
You're rhyming too much.

85
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,570
I didn't think anyone would make that complaint.

two vouchers for free cleaning from the dry cleaning place,

and various bottled drinks from the 100 yen store.

92
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,760
I bought you a cake.

93
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,780
Be grateful.

94
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,070
Th-Thanks.

95
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,410
And now, with the party in full swing,

96
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,080
here's today's main event!

97
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,000
The party just started.

98
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,240
The main event was Tatsuno's birthday.

99
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,090
You're a terrible host.

100
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,060
D-Don't give up!

101
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,600
Okay!

102
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,010
This is my present for Tatsuno.

103
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,270
Thanks.

104
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,850
A worn box?

105
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,910
There's something inside.

106
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,790
I see!

107
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,140
I'll open this box in two days on my birthday.

108
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,000
Sorry, but that wish can't be fulfilled, Tatsun.

109
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,920
Huh?

110
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,410
There's no key.

111
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,590
When Kameido from the second hand goods shop got it,

112
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,020
the key was lost and the box left unopenable.

113
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,430
It's kinda romantic because you can't open it.

114
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,030
Try pondering about the contents of the box on long Autumn nights?

115
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,180
...and she said it'd be okay if I said that.

116
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,200
Huh? No way, that's creepy.

117
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,170
Josephine Joe Star Jojo. Just wanted to try to say it, poko~

118
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,830
Ah, but isn't it nice?

119
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,910
Let's have a birthday party again sometime.

120
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,690
It's not like anyone comes to this cafe anyway.

121
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,420
Sanada, when's your birthday?

122
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,420
February.

123
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,370
That's so far off! You're useless!

124
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,880
Grandma, when's yours?

125
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:07,850
April.

126
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,920
Senpai?

127
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,970
Don't worry about me.

128
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,130
Huuh? Why? Don't be shy!

129
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:18,500
We'll give it our best here at Seaside to celebrate it.

130
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,540
When's yours anyway?

131
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,190
Mine's in May.

132
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,600
Girls born in May are wise!

133
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,700
"Wise" is a bit much.

134
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,380
So, when's your birthday?

135
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,560
Speaking of May...

136
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,000
The topic's changed, you know.

137
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:38,030
Score. I found your student handbook.

138
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,820
Stop it! It's gonna be really bad if you open it!

139
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,550
Alright. September 8th.

140
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,160
That's today.

141
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,760
You didn't want to say it.

142
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,740
What the hell did you do?

143
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,490
What are you gonna do about this awkwardness?

144
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,050
Do something.

145
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,540
Co-Congrats!

146
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,020
Ha. Ha...

147
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,030
Happy birthday to you...
Ha. Ha...

148
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,940
Happy birthday to you...

149
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,630
Right! A present! I'll go to the cheap sweets shop!

150
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,780
I don't need your cheap sympathy!

151
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,740
It'll be taken away if you play too much, poko~

152
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:41,890
The only thing I have left for a present is a matchmaking charm...

153
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,230
Oh? I'd rather have that,

154
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,620
than this Pandora's Box.

155
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,430
Then, the romantic box goes to Kon,

156
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,600
and the matchmaking thing goes to Tatsun.

157
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,770
Mmm.

158
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,970
Looks like everything will be fine.

159
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,990
You'll have to settle things now before that happens.

160
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,880
Senpai, we'll celebrate your birthday right next year.

161
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,500
I'll remember your birthday,

162
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,380
September 8th, Kon Futaba, Birthday

163
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,880
Hateful September memory, Kon Futaba.

164
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,880
No one could forget this!

165
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,680
Stop screwing with me!

166
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,880
Cup ramen is best cooked 45 seconds less, poko~

167
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,910
— Next Day —

168
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,580
Ah. It opened.

169
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,780
No way! Crazy. You could be a phantom thief...

170
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,280
and then I'd catch you.

171
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,140
But your sidekick would be senile, and not care about catching me.

172
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,390
And now, what's in the box?

173
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,620
A charm?

174
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,340
What? Boring.

175
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,830
This is a matchmaking charm.

176
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,820
That Tatsuno. I think this charm would've been more useful.

177
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,360
It's just an empty box if you open it.

178
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,720
Pandora's Box just turned into an old box.

179
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,170
How is this a matchmaking charm?

180
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,690
I'll just end up married to a wealthy African.

181
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,710
Excuse me!

182
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:22,740
Ah. You're Hotori's friend, Tacchan, right?

183
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,130
Tatsun. I mean, Tatsuno.

184
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,120
I heard you'll buy old things off me.

185
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,320
Yup. Show me what's in the box.

Hey, does "upload" mean up a road on a hill?

192

No, jeez.

193
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,990
Can't you just be a little bit helpful?

194
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:56,050
I'll put in the tags. Can you get materials?

195
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,730
Thanks Suzuki.

196
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,260
I should've been in Suzuki's group!

197
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,680
Why did I pick a jock for a partner...

198
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,750
I'm good at weightlifting and that's about all.

199
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,990
You don't have to try so hard.

200
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,090
Just copy some page and change it a little.

201
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,160
I've finally typed up the title.

206
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,230
This is the illustration you asked for.

207
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:36,680
Wow, thanks! It's perfect!

208
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,440
Alright, here's the Tatsun maid pictures I promised.

209
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,940
Marvelous!

210
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,170
If we make a big deal with the illustration..

211
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,590
You're going to get busted for fraud.

212
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:53,480
You just told me to copy some page before.

213
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,630
Guess I can't be a hypocrite.

214
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,670
Alright, this will be due in two weeks.

215
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,690
I didn't get anywhere today!

216
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,600
Thanks for waiting.

217
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,650
Uhh, the curry was...

218
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,850
Who was it for?

219
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,170
Well, whatever.

220
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,870
Share the curry!

221
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,710
So cruel! You're worse than any normal waitress!

Store

224
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,980
And you just had to write the one word I didn't want to think of while playing hooky.

225
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,850
You're turning out like grandma.

226
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,870
Alright. You're all taking responsibility for that so you're gonna get salad and coffee.

227
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,600
You dumbass! Look what you did!

228
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,840
Don't hurt the maid's feelings!

229
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,630
Hey, Tatsuntsun.

230
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,110
The nicknames are getting worse.

231
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,110
Do you have a computer at your place?

232
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,630
Yeah. My little brother usually plays games on it though.

233
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,700
Let's work on our assignment after this is over.

234
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,770
Ahh,

235
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,770
but today it sounds like Kon stayed home with a fever.

236
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,800
She lives by herself,

237
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,460
so I thought I'd go over and take care of her.

238
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,290
No way. They say idiots don't catch colds.

239
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,720
Bad timing.

240
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,520
Colds? I don't really catch them.

241
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,520
Last time I got sick was... in middle school, I think.

242
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,990
You liar. When you were in middle school

243
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,090
you were bragging about how you were never absent.

244
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,210
So you got the perfect attendance award.

245
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,320
You guys don't catch colds either, eh?

246
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,720
Hey, so is Sanada home right now?

247
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,570
Hiroyuki? He's home.

248
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,330
Good.

249
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,160
And with that said,

250
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:29,030
Plan B - can I go to Sanada's place to do my homework?

251
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,470
What are you talking about? You're in the middle of work.

252
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,670
It's also advertising for this place!

253
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,770
Well, no one is here anyway. Go ahead.

254
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,510
Yay!

255
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,700
Your customers are right here!

256
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,610
Ah. You're here everyday so I thought you were part of the seats.

257
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,280
Cruel! Grandma is a hundred times more cruel!

258
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,380
She cuts differently.

259
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,710
Her words are sharper than the tip of a knife!

260
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,390
Hold on! You going to Sanada's place?

261
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,250
Because he also has a computer.

262
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,630
You go too.

263
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,350
Hey, wait up!

264
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,790
Huh? Weren't you going to go see Kon?

265
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,140
Let's do that after.

266
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,570
Oh, PC?

267
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,280
Sure. When?

268
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,940
Now?!

269
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,690
We're going to get you something.

270
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,550
How about a potato croquette?

271
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,920
We're at the butcher's after all.

272
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,930
The butcher?

273
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,690
Even if they buy a croquette it'll be only a few minutes before they arrive!

274
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,910
And isn't the potato croquette the cheapest thing?!

275
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,470
Get me a cream puff from "Romando".

276
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,240
What? Guess I have to.

277
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,270
When did you get so fancy?

278
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,400
You're just taking advantage of me.

279
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,200
Good. I bought myself 20 minutes.

280
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,110
Ah! Shit!

281
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,380
There's a ton of porn under the desk!

282
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,270
We're coming in!

283
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,000
Made it.

284
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:02,800
Ahh!

285
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,010
The computer they're going to use

286
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:07,030
has my internet porn collection...
The computer they're going to use

287
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,960

288
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,210
What's this folder?

289
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,030
Sanada's a pervert!

290
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,070
It could happen!

291
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,840
So the only option is to delete it all.

292
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,320
It's no contest.

293
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,100
We're here.

294
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,030
Yo.

295
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,480
Sanada, are you tired?

296
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,490
I feel like I've conquered the dark side to become a Jedi.

297
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,010
What are you saying?

298
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,750
Here, your cream puff.

299
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,720
Sanada, sorry for coming so suddenly.

300
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,030
No, it's completely fine.

301
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,710
I want to put this picture on our website's splash screen.

302
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,270
I can't do it - don't have a scanner.

303
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,950
Note: Scanners is a movie. "Scanners" in the movie are people with telekinetic powers.
Scanners?

304
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:52,150
Note: Scanners is a movie. "Scanners" in the movie are people with telekinetic powers.

305
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,460
Didn't you say you wanted to be a Jedi?
Note: Scanners is a movie. "Scanners" in the movie are people with telekinetic powers.

306
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,420
Wait, that's not what we were talking about.

307
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:01,240
A "scanner" is a machine you connect to a computer to scan pictures.

308
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,610
I thought you could do anything with a computer?

309
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,200
You're like an ancient woman from a bygone age.

310
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,920
What a waste of time!

311
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,820
We're going back, four eyes!

312
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,060
Four eyes?

313
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,280
I deleted everything for no reason?

314
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,590
Huh? Isn't that the book I lent you?

315
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,380
Can't believe you stuck it there. I'm taking it back.

316
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,880
Nooo! You can't go there!

317
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,920
Guess you can't polish a turd.

318
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,860
He's the worst! From now on I'm going to call Sanada "perv-yuki."

319
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,980
At this point, guys without any porn

320
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,730
are the creepy ones.

321
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,960
C'mon, let's get to Kon's place and then go home.

322
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,000
"Yo no naka ne, kao ka, okane ka nano yo" is a palindrome, poko~

323
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,660
Huh? Kon Densuke?!

324
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,950
So she was a guy after all!

325
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,070
Guys are dangerous! Guys are pervs!

326
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,520
She's living by herself,

327
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,940
so her dad's name is on the plate.

328
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,930
Wonder if she's sleeping.

329
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,460
It's open.

330
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,590
How careless.

331
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,940
Senpai! We're coming in!

332
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,180
Careless. Careless.

333
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,290
Care...Less less le-less less.

334
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,350
Let's go!

335
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,690
Tatsun's cool!

336
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,680
Quiet! We're in a sick person's room!

337
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,650
But you started it...

338
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,060
Strong fever.

339
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,390
Senpai, you alright?

340
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,080
Her cold is worse than I expected.

341
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,570
Cover her up.

342
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,970
I'm going to make a water pillow.

343
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:57,520
Ok.

344
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:01,500
Everyone in Arai Kazutoyo's family looks the same, poko~

345
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,150
She's kinda cute when she's sleeping quietly like this.

346
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,640
It hurts. I'll die, mama.

347
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,110
Mama?

348
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,050
Senpai! You have to sleep!

349
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,080
Now I'll have to kill you.

350
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,560
Calm down!

351
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,460
Yikes!

352
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,640
You were mumbling in your sleep,

353
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,930
but we don't know what you were saying!

354
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,450
Really?

355
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,700
Really!

356
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,170
I see.

357
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,690
Senpai, please go lay down.

358
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,320
Ah, sorry.

359
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,200
I'll be fine if I just sleep through it.

360
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,200
Yeah, yeah.

361
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,090
Hotori has also fallen off her desk, poko~

362
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,950
The fever has gone down a bit from the sweating.

363
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,960
I'll make something to eat so sit still.

364
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,460
What are you making?

365
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,390
Spring onion and egg rice porridge.

366
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,970
Sounds so good.

367
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,500
It's not for you.

368
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:15,840
Fine then. I'll have the cream puff from before.

369
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,950
H-Huh? Gone?

370
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,210
What are you talking about? You gave it to Sanada.

371
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,840
Crap! So I gave it to perv-yuki for free.

372
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:32,980
The day both girls discovered the porn magazines was a day to remember.

373
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,030
Today's cream puff is bitter.

374
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,120
There's enough CDs here to open a store.

375
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,780
She really loves music.

376
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,920
A guitar!

377
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,070
But the strings are thick and I think there's not enough strings...

378
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,460
Is this a newbie guitar?

379
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,160
It's a bass.

380
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,990
Every bassist in the world will want to punch you for that.

381
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,280
Ho-ho. So this is a bass.

382
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,950
Huh? Sound's not coming out.

383
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,850
Augh, you're so annoying.

384
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,860
It's because the amp isn't turned on.

385
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,820
The sound comes out of the huge speaker?

386
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,380
Wh-wh-what?

387
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,590
Nothing at all.

388
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,930
Alright, let's go to sleep.

389
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,370
But you flipped the switch!

390
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,270
We're back.

391
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,670
Sorry for being late.

392
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,650
Hey, welcome back.

393
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,540
Yo.

394
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:45,900
Hold on!

395
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,510
You're still playing hooky from work?

396
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,770
Don't you feel weird being here till it closes?

397
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,640
I left and came back again.

398
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,120
Hiroyuki got really depressed.

399
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,910
Did something happen?

400
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:02,370
Your perv-yuki is unhealthy, isn't he?

401
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,870
Damn kid! Did he do something to you?

402
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,640
Like I'd let him!

403
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,890
(Cough) Huh?

404
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,780
We're done for today, poko~

405
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,040
Next Morning

406
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,020
Tatsun is staying home today.

407
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,900
I wonder if she caught Kon's cold.

408
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,590
Now that you mention it, my dad wasn't looking too well last night.

409
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,340
The cold's getting around.

410
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,600
I'm also kinda tired all of a sudden so I'll be going home.

411
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,570
Huh?

412
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,700
What's wrong, grandma?

413
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,460
Oh, it's Hotori.

414
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,350
It's been a while since I caught a cold.

415
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,560
It's not a big deal.

416
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,340
I don't want you to catch it so go home.

417
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,240
The cold is quickly spreading.

418
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,730
I'd better watch out.

419
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,740
Idiots don't catch colds.

420
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,950
Huh? Do I have a cold?

421
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,990
I'm way too healthy!

422
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,790
What should I do?!

423
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:19,870

Next episode

453
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:54,090
And then the two eloped to a faraway place no one knew.

454
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,910
Ahh, soaring away from everything is so romantic.

455
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:00,520
Sounds like he was a delinquent when he was young.

456
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,000
That guy wasn't a delinquent.

457
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,360
When you decide to get away by air, it's called flying away.

458
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,570
Really? Then what would you call getting away by sea?

459
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,700
Swimming away?

460
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,720
Like you'd elope by swimming away.

461
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,000
