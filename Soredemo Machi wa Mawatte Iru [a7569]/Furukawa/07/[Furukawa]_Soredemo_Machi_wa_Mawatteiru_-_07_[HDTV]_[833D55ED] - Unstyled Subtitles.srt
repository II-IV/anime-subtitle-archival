Lover's escape
Street Number 7

2
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,070
If love were a western dish...

3
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,220
Love would be a Napolitan.

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:15,570
It's full of ordinary things,

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,140

00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,320
but each ingredient brings something special.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,730
Love is like a omurice.

9
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,540
One is occupied by the beautiful surface of the egg,

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,270
but the chicken rice within must also be appreciated.

11
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,740
Love is like curry.

12
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,240
With time, the flavor develops and deepens.

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,000
What a disgusting picture.

14
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:52,580
The rainbow colored twilight is falling
七色の黄昏おりてきて
Nanairo no tasogare orite kite

15
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:58,040
The wind is kinda refreshing
風はなんだか涼しげ
Kaze ha nandaka suzushige

16
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,670
Saturday night is lively
土曜日の夜はにぎやか
Doyoubi no yoru ha nigiyaka

17
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:12,490
The only thing that'll brighten soon are your dark emotions
暗い気持さえすぐに晴れて
Kurai kimochi sae sugu ni harete

18
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,520
Everyone can't wait
みんなウキウキ

Traveling far may draw you closer to your crush.

34
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,680
Where am I suppose to go on a weekday?

35
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,200
See ya later.

36
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,880
I saw you talking to the TV all morning.

37
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,180
You're going crazy.

38
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,160
Who asked you, baldie.

39
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,250
How can you call your parent "baldie"?!

40
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,960
Also, crab for breakfast? Gimme a break.

41
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,590
Shouldn't you be thrilled to have crab in the morning?

42
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,800
How am I suppose to be happy having crab as a side dish to my bread?

43
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,110
Note: Crab bread = Kanipan, which is apparently a crab shaped cracker.
This is real crab bread.

44
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,370
Hotori?! Why do you look so terrible?

45
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,790
Morning.

46
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,730
You're usually just barely on time. Why are you so early today?

47
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,030
I missed homeroom by a hair yesterday.

48
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,640
Wah! The damn bus stopped at every red light!

49
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,740
I.. I'm gonna be late!

50
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,190
Obviously!
I.. I'm gonna be late!

51
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,930
Maybe I should give up.

52
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,600
Arashiyama, don't give up! Run!

53
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,210
Wajima?

54
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,720
Misawa?

55
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,350
Here.

56
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,850
Mori?

57
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,350
Here.

58
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,720
Yamato?

59
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,400
Heere.

60
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,240
Wajima?

61
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,660
Here!

62
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,390
Sit down.

63
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,320
Safe.

64
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,970
You're late, Arashiyama.

65
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,950
Go stand in the hallway until homeroom's over.

66
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,450
So unfair!

67
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,350
Wajima made it since her name's at the end.

68
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:07,350
Your attendance list order is the difference between heaven and hell!

69
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,980
If I were "Warashiyama" I would've been called last and made it.

70
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,680
Wah Wah.

71
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,270
Wah.. wahbit?

72
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,020
Teehee.

73
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,430
You'll be marked absent if you really keep standing there.

74
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:29,030
So that's why you're early today. Good thinking.

75
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,170
Not really.

76
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,020
I stayed up all night reading this.

77
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,370
Another mystery novel?

78
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,000
Take it.

79
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,590
Hmm. So who's the perp?

80
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,410
The girl named Misuzu.

81
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,960
You can have it back.

82
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,670
It doesn't matter who the perp is - just read it!

83
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,920
It's interesting!

84
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,800
She's like a bad drunk.

85
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,720
Thank you God! {Would just leave it "Oh god!"}

86
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,060
Thank you!

87
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,470
Thank you so much!

88
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,990
Next stop: Oya Highschool

89
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,170
So cruel!

90
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,430
There's no God or Buddha in this world!

91
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,990
Such a delirious joy...

92
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,680
Having to end this delirious happiness with my own hands

93
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,570
is just too cruel.

94
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,800
Blood type fortune: First up today is Type A!

95
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,990
Type A... Type A...

96
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:07,070
Traveling far may draw you closer to your crush.

97
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,880
I'm no man if I get off now!

98
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,880
We'll just have a rendezvous with destiny!

99
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,980
Where am I?

100
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,890
The last stop.

101
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,890
Gained two kilos in a day, poko~

102
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,270
No way... First period's started already.

103
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,790
Sorry. I mean,

104
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,360
I.. also fell asleep.

105
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,010
Doesn't the bus keep going around in a loop?

106
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,990
That's what I thought too.

107
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,120
Seems like it doesn't.

108
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,620
The world is full of mysteries.

109
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,880
The return bus comes in about 20 minutes.

110
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,920
Then we can't make it any sooner than the middle of second period.

111
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,440
Nice weather, huh?

112
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,940
Wonder if there's any gym today?

113
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,280
Would be a waste to spend all day in class.

114
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,590
At this rate, we should just skip school.

115
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,050
Just kidding.

116
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,260
Really?

117
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,480
Having ramen after yakiniku sits heavy on the stomach, poko~

118
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,750
Wow! I've never been in this town.

119
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,010
She recovers fast.

120
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:03,950
I mean... people living in places you normally never see...

121
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,010
It's a strange sort of relieving,

122
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,540
yet somewhat vexing feeling.

123
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,500
Isn't it?

124
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,760
Yeah.

125
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,620
Okay! Sanada, let's go explore!

126
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,310
You look happy.

127
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,190
Huh?

128
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:44,570
Ah, sorry. I have younger siblings so

129
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,200
I've got a habit of holding hands. Don't want to?

130
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,040
That's not it at all!

131
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,010
I don't mind it even a tiny bit,

132
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,010
but...

133
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,990
not caring whose hand you hold...

134
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,350
isn't so good for a high school girl, I think.

135
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,350
No, it's fine cuz I picked you.

136
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,990
I, Sanada Hiroyuki, have been selected!

137
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,960
I'm truly thankful for all your warm support!

138
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,580
After 5 minutes

139
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,330
After 20 minutes

140
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,080
After 35 minutes

141
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,350
I'm losing my mind!

142
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,080
I must be completely spending the rest of my life's happiness!

143
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,360
Oh! A river!

144
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,350
The Tamagawa!

145
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,730
I wonder if we can get home walking along the river?

146
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,630
If we walk far enough that our legs turn into sticks.

147
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,580
Shoot... we skipped school.

148
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,010
Who cares now.

149
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,670
Can't hurt every now and then.

150
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,790
Yeah. There are important things besides studying, right?

151
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,590
Ahh, but what am I gonna do if I get called down to the office tomorrow?

152
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,720
We're both guilty. If you get called down,

153
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,590
I'll be going down with you.

154
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,180
Yeah.

155
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,600
Wonder how many years it's been since we've played together.

156
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,350
We played a lot when we were little.

157
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,280
I wonder why did we stopped hanging out...

158
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,190
Huh?! You don't remember?!

159
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,680
You...

160
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,110
Why would I play with a girl? Moron!

161
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,580
Let's go.

162
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,290
... is what you said!

163
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,010
I might've said it.

164
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,980
I'm so sorry.

165
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,700
It's fine.

166
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,050
I thought you were going to say that some day.

167
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,560
I'm home.

168
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,980
I better not forget how I felt today.

169
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,880
Let's start a journal.

170
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,040
Umm, today... today...

171
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,990
Today I skipped school with Arashiyama and hung out.

172
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,490
Huh? Was that all?

173
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,620
Guess I should read this novel to improve my writing skills.

174
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,970
Even though I know the perp already.

175
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,890
Book title: "1/4th Murderous Intent"

176
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,000
If love were a drink...

177
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,610
Love would be a delicious coffee.

178
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,230
The bitter flavor gives a the sleepless night

179
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,080
in exchange for dependence and peace of mind.

180
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,560
Arashiyama - cold one.

181
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,440
Huh?

182
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,190
But if there's a mistake, it becomes a misunderstanding.

183
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,270
What the heck? Who's a cold one?

184
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,590
Did you forget the name of your childhood friend?!

185
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,440
Huh?

186
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,330
Calm down! Arashiyama, "cold one" is...

187
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,080
What?! Who's a cold one?

188
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,700
Sanada, you use pretty old words don't you.

189
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,410
Wha?

190
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,340
Get out!!

191
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:29,670
I also used to be a bit bad, poko~

192
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:37,480
[Night Walker] From Volume 2 Story 16

193
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,930
I can't sleep.

194
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,050
It must be because of that.

195
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,610
A little early, but let's pee and go to sleep.

196
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,610
It's out!

197
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,040
Not screaming when you're scared so you don't disturb others...

198
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,460
Very impressive.

199
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,370
Oh it's Takeru.

200
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,750
What are you doing at this hour?

201
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,170
You're a kid - go to sleep at 9 and wake up at 6.

202
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,020
But I can't sleep.

203
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,860
If I could fall asleep I would not have come to a room like yours.

204
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,260
What do you mean like mine?!

205
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,900
It's sorta your fault.

206
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,110
4 hours ago

207
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,050
Hey, have a bottle about this big?

208
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,400
I'm building something.

209
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,090
Here!

210
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,650
An energy drink for when you're tired! Napotamin C!

211
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,320
But I need an empty bottle...

212
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,750
It had a really strong taste, but I didn't want to waste it so I drank it all.

213
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,720
And now I can't sleep at all.

214
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,720
Half a bottle keeps me up, but you drunk it all.

215
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,010
But thanks to that, my castle is complete!

216
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,790
Guess I gotta do something.

217
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,300
Want to burn off that extra energy and go for a 30 minute walk?

218
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,040
Is it okay?! It's not, isn't it? It's not!

219
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,640
You're ridiculously happy looking.

220
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,720
Well, it's late night to a kid,

221
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,360
but the evening's just started for me.

222
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,330
I'll lend you a hand, poko~

223
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,380
Why are we leaving through the back door?

224
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:27,040
The front door makes a racket. Mom would find out.

225
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,420
What's with the bag?

226
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,640
Travel preparations.

227
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,100
The enemies at night are strong.

228
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,620
What are you talking about? A game?

229
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,400
We're in a ordinary peaceful town.

230
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:47,040
Huh? Seaside is still lit. Is it still open?

231
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,890
Hold up, don't get too close at night.

232
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,190
Look.

233
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,950
It's becomes a hangout for delinquent middle aged men.

234
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:57,490
Try not to be like that when you grow up.

235
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,950
But... it looks fun.

236
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,930
I'm going to be a defense attorney when I grow up and defend you.

237
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,620
Mom said...

238
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,250
That's enough!

239
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,220
Carbonation comes from carbon dioxide, poko~

240
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:17,310
Whoa. The shopping district is completely closed!

241
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,010
Alright, where should we go?

242
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,730
Huh, he's still awake.

243
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,770
Guess I'll call him down to be my bodyguard.

244
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,070
Crap. Forgot my cell phone.

245
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,480
Sis.

246
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,700
What?

247
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,490
Oh! You got something useful?

248
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,820
It's full of junk.

249
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:40,990
SS.

250
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,280
"S. S."?

251
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,060
Here.

252
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,210
What do you want me to do with this?

253
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,150
That's not it?

254
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,390
There's nothing else that counts as SS...

255
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,710
Augh. I'll get it out myself.

256
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,370
SS is an abbreviation for slingshot!

257
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,250
Like I'd know! Just call it a slingshot, you idiot.

258
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:05,720
But I only have two DD left for this season.

259
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,230
Note: DD -> Donguri Dan -> Acorn Bullet
"DD"? Acorn Bullets?

260
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,140
I figured it out this time.

261
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,310
Elementary school kids are retards.

262
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,540
It missed!

263
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,550
My precious acorn...

264
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,620
You mean "DD"?

265
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,740
Huh?

266
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,410
You'll break it if you pull that hard!

267
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,710
Who's been talking outside...

268
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,360
Who are you, you bastard?!

269
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,290
I'll fucking kill you!

270
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:44,690
Crap. My ally is now my enemy.

271
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,760
I think he'll forgive you if you apologize.

272
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:53,140
I really doubt he'd listen to me.

273
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,150
I mean, Sanada probably likes...

274
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,890
Eh, whatever.

275
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,550
What?

276
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,400
Nah, it's nothing.

277
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,380
I'll apologize to him in a year.

278
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,280
Takeru, are you hungry?

279
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,000
Hmm. Now that you mention it, I might be.

280
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,420
In front of the train station... er, that might be a little too bad to show him.

281
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,180
There's a ramen stand in front of the station.

282
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,390
Really? We can do that at night?

283
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,720
It's that happy look again.

284
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,770
I'm sleepy and my eyes are rolling, poko~

285
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,980
Now that I'm here, I wonder if I'll get fat...

286
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,990
Should be fine if I just have half.

287
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,750
Oh, it's Hotori.

288
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,660
What are you doing at this hour?

289
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,090
Are you talking nonsense?!

290
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,050
Are you, man?

291
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,590
Shhh!

292
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,390
I didn't say anything! Nothing!

293
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,390
I said I'm going to boil some bamboo tips at this hour.

294
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,220
Here.

295
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,380
"I'm boiling some bamboo tips"

296
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,380
"What are you doing, Hotori?"

297
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,890
Isn't that pushing it?!

298
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,300
Just my imagination, huh. Good. Thought I had to discipline some kids there.

299
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,770
Why is the cop eating ramen here?

300
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:26,070
I'm gonna pull a Naruto move on him and chase him away!

301
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,760
You won't be caught until the day I arrest you!

302
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,720
Any reactions?

303
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,000
Am I suppose to be Lupin?

304
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,880
Sis looks mortified.

305
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,040
I don't hear anything. Looks like she's not here.

306
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,720
I feel like I really have to catch you one day.

307
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,740
Head poko~, poko~!

308
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,230
Takeru, guess you'll have to be my attorney after all.

309
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,780
Guess we'll have to turn to

310
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,980
the always open, machine-like convenience store.

311
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,990
It's a favorite hangout for kids.

312
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,200
It's completely dark outside the store!

313
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Surprised by another ordinary thing.

314
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,800
Though it's true you've never been out after eating dinner.

315
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,670
Yamamura will be announcing midnight.

316
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,420
Takeru.

317
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,800
It's now just past 0 AM, May 1st.

318
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,560
Night Head Radio.

319
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:39,380
Your DJ is now handing it off to your amigo Kirihara.

320
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,760
"0 o'clock".. Zero o'clock?

321
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,190
Yup, that's right.

322
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,000
0 o'clock? 0 o'clock?!

323
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,730
Zero is nothing, yet there's a zero o'clock.

324
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,730
I'm scared.

325
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,640
It was April 30th just a moment ago, but

326
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,160
now it's May 1st.

327
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:04,000
You've crossed the border between yesterday and today.

328
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,040
Whaa?

329
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,180
Tomorrow's turned into today?

330
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,010
And today's turned into yesterday?

331
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,030
Yup.

332
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:21,020
You've just witnessed the world at work.

333
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,230
I wonder when I first saw this happen.

334
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,820
Wish I remembered.

335
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:44,020
They'll find out if you don't put your shoes back at the entrance.

336
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,380
Oh, right.

337
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,390
It was colder outside than I thought.

338
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,800
Let's take a bath to warm up before bed.

339
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,090
Cover it with a towel...

340
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,770
Feeling sleepy?

341
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,140
Probably.

342
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,430
Sis.

343
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,130
Yea?

344
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,290
You go out at night sometimes, don't you?

345
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,040
Eh? Why?

346
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,280
You're too good at not getting caught.

347
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,290
Today wasn't the first time, right?

348
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:29,790
You're probably better off as a prosecutor than a defense attorney.

349
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,440
Uh, I know who did it, poko~

350
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,730
But... poko~

351
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,970
If love were a snack...

352
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:44,350
Ha! I've just thought of a trick for a perfect crime.

353
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,020
Love is like a banana.

354
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:52,860
It provides a source of nourishment and a sense of closeness everyday.

355
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,720
If you kill the victim with a frozen banana...

356
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,320
And then eat the banana after...

357
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:03,750
Yes. The only thing left would be the banana skin. The murder weapon can't be found.

358
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,380
You simply saw the victim slip on the banana.

359
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,720
It becomes your camouflage! Not even the police will know.

360
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,050
I wouldn't want to eat a banana that was used to murder.

361
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,260
Ah! I wouldn't want to either!

362
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,390
Wah!

363
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:19,880

364
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,320

{shift line}

369
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,400
退屈や
Living alone is boring,
Taikutsu ya

370
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:37,530
ロック魂携えて 一人暮らしの 爆音人生
Listening to explosive music with my rock soul.
Rokku tamashii tazusaete hitori gurashi no bakuon jinsei

371
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,500

My pufferfish cheeks
Tennen no chouchin fugu no hoppeta de

372
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,730
町をカオスに 今日も巻き込む
Pulls the town into chaos.
Machi wo kaosu ni kyou mo makikomu

373
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:54,060
ツンデレは インテリジェンスの証しなり
As a sign of the tsundere's intelligence
Tsundere ha interijensu no akashi nari

374
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:58,880
今日も彼氏に なぜか告れず
I didn't confess to him today.
Kyou mo kare ni nazeka kokurezu

375
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:04,130
卓球に 命を捧げ足腰を
I play the drums to train
Takkyuu ni inochi wo sasage ashikoshi wo

376
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,630
鍛える為に ドラム叩こう
My body for ping pong.
Kitaeru tame ni doramu tatakou

377
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:13,100
こんなバンドでもヤラセじゃねぇ
But this band isn't a fake!
Konna bando demo yarase ja nee

378
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,050
こんなメンバーロックじゃねぇ
The members aren't playing rock!
Konna memba- rokku ja nee

379
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:19,110
目指してるのは音頭じゃねぇ
We're not trying to lead the song!
Mezashiteruno ha ondou ja nee

380
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,060
たどり着くのは涅槃じゃねぇ！
We're not looking for Nirvana!
Tadoritsuku no ha nehan ja nee!

381
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,680
我らはメイドっ！（イエー！）
We're maids! Yea!
Warera ha meido! (Yea!)

382
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,500
メイド姿で参上！参上！
Visiting in maid outfits! Visiting!
Meido sugata de sanjyou! Sanjyou!

383
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,000
アチョー！

384
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,620
ここらはメイド！（イエー！）
They're maids! Yea!

385
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,530

390
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:45,030

Kiyoku - Tadashiku - Isagiyoku Shi-saido ha (zessan!)

391

Eigyouchuu! (Meido! Arigatou gozaima-su!)

392
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,350
The time is the 21th century.

393
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,010
Suddenly,

394
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,520
convenient machines like washers and dryers were invented.

395
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,730
Even forgetting to dry your clothing after washing,

396
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,490
they don't end up smelling like washcloths.

397
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,610
It's like something from the world of dreams.

398
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,820
But! However!

399
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,620
There is no machine to fold the laundry and put it into the drawers!

400
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,910
We're still far from calling this

401
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,210
true automation.

402
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:13,260
Next time, Street number 8, "Automatic Band."

403
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,760
Street Number 8 [Automatic Band]
Next time, Street number 8, "Automatic Band."

404
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,180
Street Number 8 [Automatic Band]

405
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,720
We'll be nihilistic all over, poko~
Street Number 8 [Automatic Band]
