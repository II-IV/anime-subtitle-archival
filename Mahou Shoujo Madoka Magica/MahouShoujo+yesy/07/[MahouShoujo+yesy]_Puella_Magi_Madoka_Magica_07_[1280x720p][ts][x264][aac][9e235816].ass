Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.74,0:00:19.00,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You deceived us, didn't you?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.65,0:00:23.83,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I merely asked if you wanted to be a magical girl.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.23,0:00:28.25,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I just didn't explain some aspects of being one.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.76,0:00:34.84,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Why didn't you tell us?!
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.84,0:00:36.84,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You didn't ask.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.84,0:00:40.85,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,If you never found out, it wouldn't have bothered you a bit.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:40.85,0:00:44.27,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Mami, for example, never did.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.84,0:00:51.36,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Besides, you humans don't even realize you have souls in the first place.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.87,0:00:58.89,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Your body's nothing more than a collection of neurons and a centralized cardiovascular system.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.62,0:01:04.95,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,So when a human body can no longer maintain life, its soul vanishes along with it.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.37,0:01:11.96,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I gave your soul a physical form to prevent that from happening—a form you can pick up with your own hands and protect.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.49,0:01:15.97,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,That way you can battle witches a little more safely.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.52,0:01:19.49,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Nobody asked you to do that!
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.74,0:01:23.31,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You're taking fighting far too lightly.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.20,0:01:30.99,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,For example, how much do you think it would stimulate your pain receptors if your stomach were to be impaled by a spear?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.49,0:01:44.66,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,This is how it would actually feel.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.83,0:01:47.66,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You can't even move, and that's how it would feel with only one strike.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.34,0:01:58.51,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,The only reason you were able to remain standing during your fight with Kyouko was that anything too painful was limited.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.74,0:02:02.72,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It was only possible because your consciousness isn't directly linked with your body.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.95,0:02:06.43,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You survived your fight because of it.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.92,0:02:17.45,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,If you got used to it, you could learn to completely cut off all pain.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.92,0:02:22.45,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,But since your reaction times would slow, I don't suggest it.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.26,0:02:24.45,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Why...
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.45,0:02:26.84,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Why did you do this to us?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.84,0:02:31.46,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You had a wish so important that you agreed to a fate of combat, am I correct?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.93,0:02:34.45,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,And your wish came true, didn't it?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.04,0:04:24.24,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Stand.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.90,0:04:26.54,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Bow.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.82,0:04:50.38,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Homura-chan, did you know about that?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.41,0:04:54.86,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Why didn't you tell us?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.86,0:04:59.74,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,No one has believed me thus far, even when I warned them in advance.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.67,0:05:03.39,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Why does Kyubey do something so cruel?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.69,0:05:05.90,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,He doesn't think it's cruel.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.23,0:05:09.62,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,He's a creature that doesn't understand human values.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.06,0:05:14.29,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,He'll just say it was an appropriate payment for bringing about a miracle.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.66,0:05:17.54,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,That's not fair at all!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.95,0:05:24.55,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,He did that to her, and all Sayaka-chan wanted to do was heal someone she loved!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.59,0:05:29.55,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It was still a miracle.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.89,0:05:32.81,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,He made the impossible possible.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.23,0:05:36.71,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Even if Miki Sayaka spent her entire life tending to him,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.71,0:05:40.31,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,he would never have been able to play the violin again.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.31,0:05:45.45,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Normally a miracle costs far more than a human life,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.32,0:05:48.57,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,but Kyubey goes around selling them for that price.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.32,0:05:53.58,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Sayaka-chan won't be able to go back to her normal life?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.89,0:05:58.08,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I've said this already, have I not? Give up on Miki Sayaka.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.08,0:06:00.84,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Sayaka-chan saved me!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.59,0:06:08.09,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,If Sayaka-chan wasn't a magical girl at the time, Hitomi-chan and I would have died!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.70,0:06:11.10,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You mustn't confuse gratitude and responsibility.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.30,0:06:15.91,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,There is no way for you to save her.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.58,0:06:22.44,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You want to repay her so you don't feel inferior, but it's not your place and you need to stop thinking that way.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.45,0:06:28.46,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Homura-chan, why are you always so cold?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.13,0:06:34.37,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I suppose I am. It might be because I'm no longer human.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.30,0:06:45.24,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,How can I visit Kyousuke after being turned into this thing?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.63,0:06:48.47,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Just how long are you going to lie there and mope, dummy?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.51,0:07:01.07,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Come out for a bit.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.07,0:07:02.02,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,We need to talk.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.19,0:07:14.20,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You're beginning to regret what was done to your body, aren't you?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.36,0:07:20.50,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm kind of just going with it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.50,0:07:24.71,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I mean, I can do whatever I want with the power I got out of the deal.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.71,0:07:27.71,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It's not really something to regret at the end of the day.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.10,0:07:30.22,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You just got what you deserved.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.52,0:07:33.72,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,That's a good idea. You can think of it that way.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.18,0:07:37.72,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,If you live only for yourself, everything you do is your own fault.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.08,0:07:41.69,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You have no reason to resent others, and there's no way you'll have any regrets.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.86,0:07:45.73,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You can get through just about anything if you think that way.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.53,0:08:08.05,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Why did you bring me all the way out here?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.35,0:08:11.63,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It'll be kind of a long talk.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.62,0:08:17.43,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Want one?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:27.56,0:08:29.78,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Don't waste food.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.28,0:08:31.32,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I'll kill you.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.08,0:08:56.47,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,This was my dad's church.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:57.49,0:09:00.47,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,He was extremely honest and way too kind.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:00.91,0:09:07.04,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Every day when he read the newspaper in the morning, he'd start to tear up and seriously worry about things—he was that type of guy.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:08.17,0:09:15.03,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,My dad always said that in order to save a new era, you'd need a new type of religion.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.53,0:09:20.45,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,That's why sometimes he'd preach things that weren't part of the doctrine.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.98,0:09:23.95,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,As a result, everyone stopped coming, of course.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:24.50,0:09:26.30,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,He was even excommunicated.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:27.08,0:09:30.53,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,No one would listen to what he had to say.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.80,0:09:33.34,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I mean, it makes sense.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.34,0:09:36.34,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It would seem like some sort of sketchy cult if you knew nothing about it.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.87,0:09:43.12,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,But it wouldn't matter if he was talking about doing what was right, or what was obvious—he was an outcast in the eyes of society.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.70,0:09:49.14,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Our whole family was left with nothing, not even food to eat.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:49.96,0:09:51.15,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I couldn't accept it.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.62,0:09:58.16,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,My dad wasn't saying anything wrong. He was just saying things that differed from the norm.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:58.92,0:10:06.08,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,If anyone would lend him their ear for just five minutes, they'd realize that what he was saying was right.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:07.41,0:10:11.38,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,But no one listened to him in the end.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:12.80,0:10:14.13,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I couldn't stand it.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:14.13,0:10:15.25,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I couldn't forgive what was happening.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:15.51,0:10:20.18,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I couldn't bear the fact that no one understood what he was saying.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:21.98,0:10:28.77,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,That's why I asked Kyubey to make it so people would seriously listen to what he was saying.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:31.77,0:10:35.90,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,The next morning, my dad's church was filled with people.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:36.43,0:10:40.16,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,The number of believers multiplied at a frightening rate each day,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:40.98,0:10:44.55,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,and I became yet another magical girl.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:45.76,0:10:51.50,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,No matter how good my dad's sermons were, it wouldn't help in killing any of the witches.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:51.50,0:10:56.40,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I thought that was where I came in, so I got all hyped up about it like an idiot.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:57.25,0:11:02.09,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I thought that my dad and I would save the world—he publicly, and me from the shadows.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:04.83,0:11:07.81,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,But one day my dad found out what was going on.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:09.44,0:11:16.98,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,My dad completely flipped out once he found out most of his followers were there not because of his sermons, but because of magic.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:17.40,0:11:21.99,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,He called me, his daughter, a witch that swayed people's hearts.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:22.70,0:11:28.54,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Pretty funny, huh? I had been fighting real witches every night and that's what he had to say.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:29.41,0:11:31.17,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,And then my dad snapped.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:32.59,0:11:34.54,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,He was pitiful in the end.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:35.47,0:11:38.26,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,He drowned himself in alcohol and went crazy.
