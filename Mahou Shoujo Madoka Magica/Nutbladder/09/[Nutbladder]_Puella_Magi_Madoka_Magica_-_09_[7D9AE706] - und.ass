Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.15,0:06:55.95,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Madoka, have you ever heard the term "entropy"?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.07,0:07:03.80,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,To put it simply, the energy produced by burning a log is less than that expended in growing a tree.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.22,0:07:11.45,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Changing forms of energy creates losses, and the amount of energy in the universe gradually diminishes.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.82,0:07:38.89,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Unfortunately, our race lacks emotion.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.89,0:07:44.69,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Thus, we studied many races throughout the stars, before finally settling on humanity.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.73,0:07:53.55,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Taking into account humanity's vast population and short generations, the emotional energy generated
Dialogue: 0,0:07:53.55,0:07:58.37,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,by a single human is far in excess of what is necessary for their birth and maturation.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.82,0:08:03.92,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Thus, your souls suffice as a method to reverse entropy.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.97,0:08:20.06,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,a massive burst of energy is released.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.06,0:08:24.52,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,And our role as Incubators is to harvest it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.45,0:08:28.62,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,We're nothing but raw materials? {lit. consumable goods, but even 'raw materials' is pushing madoka's vocab.}
Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.15,0:08:32.40,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,And you expect us to die for you...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.82,0:08:39.61,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Do you realize how much energy is consumed every moment in this universe crowded with life?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.61,0:08:44.92,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Someday humanity, too, shall awaken from its Earthen cradle and join our ranks.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:44.92,0:08:49.87,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,And we certainly can't leave you a withered, dead universe, can we?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.87,0:08:54.88,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Viewed over the long term, this is a profitable exchange for you as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.43,0:08:57.96,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,That doesn't make any sense!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.31,0:09:02.59,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Are you telling me Mami died for that kind of incomprehensible reason?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.59,0:09:04.90,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,And that's why Sayaka ended up how she did?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:05.64,0:09:08.98,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I can't stand it! That's just too cruel!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:10.16,0:09:14.62,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,But we always form contracts with your consent.

Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.24,0:09:24.31,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,We do not understand the concept of deception.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:24.31,0:09:31.00,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Why do humans abhor others for their own lapses in judgment stemming from limited understanding?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.63,0:09:35.03,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I don't even understand what you're trying to say.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:35.52,0:09:37.81,madoka-dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I can't comprehend it at all.
