Comment: 0,0:08:19.06,0:08:19.06,Takuto,,0,0,0,Note,This exchange features a wordplay between pakuri (gaping mouth, chomp/bite off) and pakuru (steal, rip off). The original afk lines tried to represent this literally and failed to make any sense at all.
Comment: 0,0:11:11.98,0:11:15.11,Mitsuki,,0,0,0,Note,Note: || in these comments means that the original afk subs went to a new subtitle at that point, while the rewritten line has joined together.
Comment: 0,0:15:36.20,0:15:36.20,Mitsuki,,0,0,0,Note,Admittedly, above line is a bit liberal. The word here is konrinzai, which according to JWPce = 金輪際 【こんりんざい】 (adv,n) "the deepest bottom of the earth, never, not .. at all, on no account, for all the world, till doomsday" But I think it works.
Comment: 0,0:17:08.59,0:17:10.59,Default (Plain),,0,0,0,Note,afk: Leaving it to an amateur...  ...did you really think that I'd do that? // More awkward lines caused by trying to rigidly follow the Japanese sentence structure. Plus, the second line was wrong anyway; he's clearly asking if she can take sole responsibility. I spiced these up by adding the "got burned" / "take the heat" metaphor. Additionally, it creates something of an extra joke when T&M spill coffee on him in the next scene.
