1
00:00:05,633 --> 00:00:08,400
Production for Full Moon's next single
has finally been put into motion!

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,233
She has decided to sing
a song her father wrote.

3
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:16,133
The only thing left to do was
to ask Mr. Takasu to produce it!

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,500
Unfortunately, Madoka Wakamatsu has
already tapped him

5
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:20,366
to produce the same song!

6
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:24,300
So who're we gonna ask to be
the producer for Full Moon?!

7
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,833
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

8
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:33,633
Got that?

9
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:34,666
Yes.

10
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:13,500
<i>Dr. Nakamura of Internal Medicine.</i>
<i>Please come to the pharmacy.</i>

11
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:17,400
<i>Dr. Nakamura of Internal Medicine.</i>
<i>Please come to the pharmacy.</i>

12
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:19,400
– Hey...
– O-Okay.

13
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,933
Why? Aren't you gonna knock?

14
00:02:26,566 --> 00:02:29,233
Huh? What's the matter, Mitsuki?
What are you doing here?

15
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,033
Umm... I was in the neighborhood so...

16
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,166
Well... See you!

17
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:39,033
Huh?

18
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,300
<i>I see. It was difficult to</i>
<i>raise the subject, huh?</i>

19
00:02:49,866 --> 00:02:51,833
<i>In that case,</i>
<i>I'll speak with him directly.</i>

20
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:53,200
<i>Mitsuki, you stay there.</i>

21
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,066
Okay. I'm sorry.

22
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:01,700
Gimme a break.
I'm the one who wants to sigh.

23
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,833
Why couldn't you just
come out with it?

24
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:06,700
I mean... How can I put it?

25
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,933
It felt like trying to involve
Dr. Wakaoji in some childish stuff

26
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:11,700
and I just couldn't go forward with it.

27
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,033
It isn't childish!

28
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,600
You're so concerned about others.

29
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,500
That's not very childlike, you know?

30
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,066
Y-You really think so?

31
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:24,000
You don't think I'm...childlike?

32
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:26,200
And that Takuto,

33
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:30,033
I invited him to come along,
but he said "I'll refrain!"

34
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:31,466
What the heck is he thinking?!

35
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:33,900
Takuto's "I'll refrain" is...

36
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:35,100
That's not a lie.

37
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,133
What do you mean?

38
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:41,100
He thinks that Dr. Wakaoji doesn't
think too highly of him.

39
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:42,333
What's that about?

40
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:50,800
<i>I'd like Dr. Wakaoji and Takuto to</i>
<i>get along,</i>

41
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,366
<i>but maybe that won't work after all.</i>

42
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,333
<i>Them being a doctor and</i>
<i>a Death Spirit and all.</i>

43
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:18,400
So what I'm saying is that if you,
Doctor, as a former member of Route L,

44
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:21,600
would agree to be the producer,
not only would it be a news hook but

45
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,833
we would also be able to target
the housewife demographic

46
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:26,366
that used to be Route L fans.

47
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,433
Something like this.

48
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:33,366
Wow, it feels like a power game
between two adults.

49
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:34,500
Yeah, yeah.

50
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:39,066
I will have to decline.

51
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,766
Huh?

52
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,866
C-Could you tell me
the reason why?

53
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:46,100
To tell you the truth...

54
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,466
If you don't agree to do it, Doctor,
this plan will just blow over.

55
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:55,033
Please, just agree to do it
for Mitsuki's sake.

56
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,466
I have to decline.

57
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,633
Why?

58
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,300
Just because.

59
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,600
– I can't believe this! I mean...
– That's what I thought.

60
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,733
– You are the only person we can turn to!
– It won't do, will it?

61
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:07,766
– While we're doing this, the other side...
– I know we're asking a lot, but...

62
00:05:57,266 --> 00:05:59,666
This is our concept for this project.

63
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,666
Th-That's pretty daring.

64
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:03,933
It's kind of mismatched.

65
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,300
That's what I was aiming for...
mismatching.

66
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:08,133
Huh?

67
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,766
In order to call attention to
Madoka Wakamatsu's primitive rawness,

68
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:15,900
I intentionally juxtaposed that against
the inorganic antithesis. Get it?

69
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:17,400
H-Huh?

70
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:20,566
All right then, I want each
of you to start working

71
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,233
from the base of this conceptual image.

72
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:23,866
Are there any questions?

73
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:31,766
<i>Kohei Takasu... He certainly isn't</i>
<i>called a hit maker for nothing.</i>

74
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,933
<i>I'm certain that he will...</i>

75
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:35,966
<i>Madoka, turn this way!</i>

76
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:37,300
<i>Okay!</i>

77
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,966
<i>Make me into a superstar.</i>

78
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,833
Oh my gosh!

79
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:48,233
– Huh?
– Huh?

80
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:54,433
I'm sorry. I messed up on
that strategy a little.

81
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,933
We need to turn over a new leaf.

82
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,933
But I wonder what strategy
we should go with.

83
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:00,666
Hmm...

84
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:04,800
Umm... Ms. Oshige... It might be
bothering the doctor too much.

85
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:06,966
Hey, come on,
don't say things like that!

86
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,500
It's your song, you know?!

87
00:07:08,766 --> 00:07:09,400
Yes.

88
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:13,166
Mitsuki, why are you holding a pillow?

89
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,066
Huh? Huh?

90
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:17,000
Huh?!

91
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:28,166
What's that?!

92
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,366
PRODUCER'S CHAIR

93
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:33,966
Goodness gracious.

94
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:42,666
Meroko is asking you too.

95
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:53,400
Please return that to me.

96
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,633
If I return it, will you
agree to my request?

97
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,400
Hey!

98
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,166
Please!

99
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,366
Here! Here! Here! Here!
Here! Here!

100
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,333
Please! Please!

101
00:08:13,366 --> 00:08:15,266
Please, please, please, please...

102
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,066
Please!

103
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,733
Please, please, please,
please, please...

104
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:23,733
Please!

105
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:25,533
You're in the way!

106
00:08:26,466 --> 00:08:29,300
Gimme a break!
What is up with that doctor?!

107
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,433
Taking that attitude when he knows
she doesn't have much time left.

108
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:35,100
He said something before
like he wouldn't "allow it."

109
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:37,633
Right. In other words,
the length of her life.

110
00:08:37,966 --> 00:08:40,000
It's not that I don't understand
what he says

111
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:41,000
from the point of view
of a doctor, but...

112
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:43,066
He's totally inflexible!

113
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,333
Huh?

114
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:48,500
Hey, hey, what have you been
doing all this time?

115
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,900
Yes... Well...

116
00:08:51,766 --> 00:08:53,033
Umm...

117
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,700
FORGET IT
ASK FOR IT

118
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:00,600
Huh?!

119
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,000
What is she doing?

120
00:09:09,366 --> 00:09:10,666
She's drawing fortunes.

121
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:15,600
It happened again.

122
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,966
What are you doing?!

123
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,000
It's the same, no matter
how many times you do that.

124
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,933
You won't be content,
no matter which way it goes, right?

125
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,033
First of all,

126
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:30,366
I don't think much of trying
to decide by drawing fortunes!

127
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:33,933
I guess you're right.

128
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,233
I think the doctor is aware of
the fact that

129
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,633
your feelings about this
are still wavering.

130
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:43,433
Makes sense!
That's why he didn't give his okay!

131
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,033
First of all, you have
to make up your mind.

132
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:47,900
I agree!

133
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,500
I couldn't...

134
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,966
give up music...

135
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,333
but Dr. Wakaoji was able to
give up music.

136
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,400
Something he loved so much.

137
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:05,666
To do that must have taken
a great deal of resolve.

138
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,033
Much more than it would take me.

139
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:10,166
You may be right.

140
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:13,166
But you're not about to say
you're gonna give up

141
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,533
singing "Eternal Snow"
because of that, are you?

142
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:18,066
No, I won't give that up.

143
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:22,133
I see...
If so, I guess it's okay.

144
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,133
What's our next class again?

145
00:10:30,266 --> 00:10:31,966
The movment of constellations
and the moon.

146
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,200
Huh? They bought you a computer?

147
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:38,433
Yeah.

148
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:39,866
I'm so jealous.

149
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:44,600
My father's nice, so he agrees
to anything I ask him!

150
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:48,133
I wouldn't call that nice,
I'd call it being soft.

151
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:49,200
That's awful.

152
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,166
<i>Dr. Wakaoji, this is Mitsuki's request.</i>

153
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,200
<i>Please be my producer!</i>

154
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:02,333
<i>If it's something you're requesting,</i>
<i>Mitsuki, I can't turn you down.</i>

155
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:07,400
<i>Yippee! I'm so happy!</i>
<i>I love you, Dr. Wakaoji!</i>

156
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,900
But it's not a request
of that level, is it?

157
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,933
We want to go with "Eternal Snow,"
no matter what.

158
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:19,100
Why are you so insistent
about it?

159
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:21,566
Because you're telling me to
change the song, Department Manager!

160
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,500
But realistically, it's impossible to go
with "Eternal Snow," right?

161
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,633
'Cause no producer will
agree to handle it.

162
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,733
There's someone
I'm negotiating with right now!

163
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,100
Well, I sure hope Seed Records
will agree to that person.

164
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,533
I believe that they will agree.

165
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:37,133
I don't want to say this,
but if things continue this way

166
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,966
you might be transferred to
a different department.

167
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:43,066
Are you saying that
they'll switch managers?

168
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,500
To be totally honest, that's exactly it.

169
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,900
That's...

170
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,566
This is Cassiopeia at 7:00.

171
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:20,166
Two hours later, at 9:00.

172
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,533
The shape is the same,
but the position is like this.

173
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,433
I see. Thank you.
Please return to your seat.

174
00:12:31,766 --> 00:12:33,700
What's the matter?
You don't seem to have any pep.

175
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,666
Oh, it's nothing. I'm fine.

176
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,966
<i>I can't consult Tomoe</i>
<i>about something like this.</i>

177
00:12:42,766 --> 00:12:44,533
As Tomoe explained,

178
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,600
the shape of constellations
do not change even if the time changes.

179
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,566
But the position changes
as the time changes.

180
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,200
All right. Next, let's look
at the relationship

181
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:54,933
between the moon and the earth.

182
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:59,900
As you all know, the moon does
not emit light.

183
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:00,766
<i>Huh?</i>

184
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,233
So what makes it appear bright is...

185
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,633
Do you know why, Hasegawa?

186
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:10,166
<i>See, Mitsuki, the moon</i>
<i>doesn't shine on its own.</i>

187
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,000
<i>Then why does it shine?</i>

188
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:14,066
<i>That's because...</i>

189
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:16,966
<i>With the sun at the center...</i>

190
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,933
<i>It's because the earth and</i>
<i>the moon are revolving around it...</i>

191
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:24,500
<i>Because it reflects the sun's light</i>
<i>just like a mirror</i>

192
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:26,033
<i>which makes it look</i>
<i>like it's shining.</i>

193
00:13:26,366 --> 00:13:30,266
<i>So if there weren't a sun,</i>
<i>the moon wouldn't shine?</i>

194
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,500
<i>That's right.</i>

195
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,100
<i>In that case...</i>

196
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:34,566
<i>In that case?</i>

197
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,333
<i>You're my sun, aren't you, Eichi?</i>

198
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,300
<i>Not just me.</i>

199
00:13:41,466 --> 00:13:45,133
<i>The people at the facility,</i>
<i>the teachers at school and your friends.</i>

200
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:48,900
<i>And also your late father</i>
<i>and mother, Mitsuki.</i>

201
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,333
<i>I think they're all</i>
<i>making you shine, Mitsuki.</i>

202
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,000
<i>Yeah.</i>

203
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:59,400
<i>So you should just be true</i>
<i>to yourself, Mitsuki,</i>

204
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:02,433
<i>because we'll all make you shine.</i>

205
00:14:03,766 --> 00:14:05,966
<i>Eichi, I'll...</i>

206
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,900
I'll ask him, after all!

207
00:14:15,933 --> 00:14:17,266
M-Mitsuki?

208
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,766
Can I ask something too?

209
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,066
I sure would like you
to take your seat.

210
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,766
Huh?

211
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,866
Mitsuki, you are blushing.

212
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,400
And, what is it?

213
00:14:36,733 --> 00:14:38,933
Please, Dr. Wakaoji!

214
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,066
Please agree to be
the producer!

215
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,366
That again?

216
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:48,033
Even if you ask me, Mitsuki,

217
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,666
there are things I can
and cannot do.

218
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:52,666
I understand that.

219
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,466
But, I want to ask you to do it,
Dr. Wakaoji, by any means.

220
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,600
I want to ask you, Dr. Wakaoji,
to produce "Eternal Snow."

221
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:02,966
That's impossible, Mitsuki.

222
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:06,066
I'm happy that you feel
that way but...

223
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:07,333
I see.

224
00:15:08,466 --> 00:15:09,733
Maybe he still has lingering regrets.

225
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:11,500
Huh? What did you just say?

226
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:14,266
I said, maybe he still
has lingering regrets.

227
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:16,000
W-What do you mean?

228
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,566
Mitsuki, who are you talking to?

229
00:15:18,566 --> 00:15:19,533
Don't tell me it's those two?!

230
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,733
It looks like she isn't able
to say this to you,

231
00:15:23,766 --> 00:15:25,266
so I'll say it to you directly.

232
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:28,033
Don't you still have lingering regrets
about music?

233
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:31,100
Not at all.

234
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,266
I'm envious.

235
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,733
What do you mean?

236
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:40,233
In my work as a Death Spirit,
I've seen a lot of different people.

237
00:15:40,866 --> 00:15:42,500
Despite it all, when it
comes time for them to die

238
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:47,366
they all say "I wish I had done this,"
"I wish I had done that."

239
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,433
S-Stop it, Takuto!

240
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:51,166
It may be strange coming from me,

241
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,033
you can only do things
you like while you're alive.

242
00:15:55,566 --> 00:15:57,533
And therefore, you
should live to the fullest!

243
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,566
I don't want a Death Spirit to
tell me something like that.

244
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:03,366
That may be true.

245
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,666
And moreover, the words of
a stuffed animal like me don't carry

246
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,800
the least bit of weight
to convince you.

247
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,100
But, as I said earlier,

248
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:14,333
you can only do things
you like while you're alive.

249
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:16,600
And this girl here is working hard
to do exactly that.

250
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,333
Putting her short life on the line,
and with that petite body.

251
00:16:21,033 --> 00:16:23,900
There may be difficult
and sad times,

252
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:26,700
but it's nothing compared to
singing the songs that she loves!

253
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:31,100
I'm...I'm sorry, Dr. Wakaoji.

254
00:16:31,466 --> 00:16:32,933
I'm sorry to have troubled you.

255
00:16:33,566 --> 00:16:34,433
Goodbye!

256
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,500
You darn brat!

257
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,300
<i>At that time,</i>

258
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,333
<i>when it was completely decided</i>
<i>that Route L would break up</i>

259
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,200
<i>I cast aside music.</i>

260
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:57,400
<i>I decided to walk another</i>
<i>path in life</i>

261
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,633
<i>that was unrelated to music.</i>

262
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:03,500
<i>I chose the path of medicine.</i>

263
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,200
<i>I don't have any regrets</i>
<i>about that decision.</i>

264
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,666
<i>The work of a doctor has many rewards.</i>

265
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,166
<i>However...</i>

266
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,000
<i>My heart ached every time</i>
<i>I heard music.</i>

267
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,533
<i>As if it were touching an old wound.</i>

268
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:25,066
<i>Are those lingering regrets?</i>

269
00:17:25,966 --> 00:17:27,666
<i>In that is the case, I...</i>

270
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,733
<i>Compared to me, Mitsuki is...</i>

271
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:40,200
<i>Why do I like you so much?</i>

272
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:47,500
<i>Your voice echoes and</i>
<i>it sounds almost sad.</i>

273
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:53,366
Only while one is alive, huh?

274
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,966
I can't believe you,
you idiot, Takuto!

275
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,233
Why did you say something
like that to Dr. Wakaoji?

276
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:04,566
Because I couldn't hold back
from saying that!

277
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:12,700
Hey, hey... Did something happen?

278
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,800
Darn him! That blockhead!

279
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:18,933
Hey! Am I gonna be
the only one left out?

280
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,433
She's late.

281
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:29,766
Yeah... I wonder what's the matter.

282
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:31,733
Mitsuki...

283
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,466
Ms. Oshige...

284
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,100
Sorry I'm late.

285
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,100
W-What's the matter?
You look pale.

286
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,366
Yeah, I drank too much last night.

287
00:18:42,566 --> 00:18:43,333
A broken heart?

288
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,333
No, I was so angry.

289
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:46,200
About what?

290
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:47,566
The department manager...

291
00:18:48,266 --> 00:18:50,666
That has nothing to do with you!

292
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,866
Okay, we're going to work!

293
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:57,966
Ms. Oshige, be careful!

294
00:19:09,266 --> 00:19:10,100
All right, thank you.

295
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:11,700
Thank you very much.

296
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:13,366
Hey! She's done!

297
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:17,800
Is your hangover better?

298
00:19:18,966 --> 00:19:20,000
A little.

299
00:19:21,266 --> 00:19:23,566
D-Dr. Wakaoji.

300
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,366
Huh?

301
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,500
Oh...

302
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,100
The matter we discussed other day...

303
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,233
I have given it
careful thought.

304
00:19:30,766 --> 00:19:32,500
Doctor, I'm so sorry.

305
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:34,000
– I won't bother you again like that.
– On certain conditions...

306
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:37,566
I will agree to be Mitsuki's producer.

307
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:38,466
– Huh?!
– What?!

308
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:39,666
– Huh?!
– Huh?!

309
00:19:39,866 --> 00:19:42,400
U-Under conditions?
If you're talking about your fee...

310
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:44,933
I don't care about the money.

311
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,133
Because I'll be able
to play music again.

312
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,066
Th-Then what are your conditions?

313
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:56,266
Are they something we can do?

314
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,733
My conditions are...

315
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,700
Mitsuki...

316
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:00,666
Y-Yes?

317
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,533
First, that you'll undergo
regular checkups for your throat.

318
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:06,933
And second,
when push comes to shove,

319
00:20:06,966 --> 00:20:10,600
you will follow my instructions,
including undergoing surgery, okay?

320
00:20:10,966 --> 00:20:12,766
S-Surgery?

321
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,333
That's...

322
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:16,866
Of course, I will do the surgery
when the time comes.

323
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:20,733
Although, I'm not full-time now,
only part-time.

324
00:20:20,766 --> 00:20:21,566
Huh?

325
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:25,300
<i>Are you serious, Dr. Wakaoji?</i>

326
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,000
<i>I had already decided on you</i>
<i>for the next hospital director.</i>

327
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,666
<i>I need some time.</i>

328
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:34,100
I apologize for my selfishness,
but I ask for your understanding.

329
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,666
Doctor...

330
00:20:37,533 --> 00:20:39,200
It's also for myself.

331
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,300
I haven't been able to
forget music, after all.

332
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,700
I actually wanted to be cool
and hand in my resignation,

333
00:20:46,066 --> 00:20:50,000
but there's one thing besides
music that I still have to do.

334
00:20:52,433 --> 00:20:54,866
And that is to mend
your throat, Mitsuki.

335
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,200
Doctor...

336
00:20:57,066 --> 00:21:00,566
I would love to hear you sing
"Eternal Snow" too, Mitsuki.

337
00:21:01,933 --> 00:21:06,866
I would like your father and mother
to listen to it up in heaven.

338
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,966
I believe in you, Dr. Wakaoji!

339
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:14,766
You, if anybody, will make me
shine more than ever!

340
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,300
That's my intention too.

341
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:20,900
I want you to shine more and more
so that Eichi will take notice, okay?

342
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,900
Okay!

343
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,066
And also, this...

344
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:27,800
It was on the floor of
the hospital room.

345
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,866
I asked everyone
but nobody knew who it belonged to.

346
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,200
So I thought it might be yours, Mitsuki.

347
00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:36,833
Thank you, Dr. Wakaoji.

348
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,600
I look forward to working with you.

349
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:41,833
I look forward to working
with you too, Mitsuki.

350
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,866
Rather... Full Moon!

351
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:44,766
Yes!

352
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,933
Why the long face, Meroko?

353
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:26,366
It's fine that we asked Dr. Wakaoji
to produce her record,

354
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:29,133
but he won't let her rehearse
her song at all!

355
00:23:29,566 --> 00:23:33,533
And he's asking her what she
wants to do in the song!

356
00:23:33,766 --> 00:23:36,033
At this rate,
we can't record!

357
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:39,100
Don't worry.
I'm sure she'll find the answer.

358
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:43,800
Next time on Full Moon:
"My Message"

359
00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:45,300
– Look forward to it!
– Look forward to it!
