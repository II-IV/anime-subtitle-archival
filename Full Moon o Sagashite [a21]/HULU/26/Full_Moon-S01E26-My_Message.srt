1
00:00:05,566 --> 00:00:08,566
We asked Dr. Wakaoji to
be Full Moon's producer,

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,566
but for some reason,
he wouldn't accept.

3
00:00:10,633 --> 00:00:13,333
I tried different tactics,
but none of them worked.

4
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:16,366
Just when I thought,
"Dr. Wakaoji won't do it,"

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,966
all of a sudden, he said that
he would produce Full Moon's recording.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,700
It seems like something that
Takuto said made him decide.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,100
But I wonder what Takuto said to him.

8
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,833
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

9
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:33,600
Got that?

10
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:34,733
Yes.

11
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:17,700
SHI-CHAN's Music Power!

12
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,900
Hello, It's SHI-CHAN,
also known as Shizue Oda.

13
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:22,000
How has everybody been?

14
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:25,066
Well then! Let's start with
this week's top news!

15
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:30,300
<i>It seems Oji from Route L</i>
<i>is going to make a comeback</i>

16
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:33,066
<i>to the music scene by</i>
<i>producing Full Moon.</i>

17
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,266
<i>You do pretty well there, Oshige.</i>

18
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:38,766
<i>Who'd a thought you'd get Wakaoji?</i>

19
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:42,666
<i>Well then, let's both do our best!</i>

20
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,333
Yes!

21
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:49,566
<i>Anyway, the song is a phantom song</i>
<i>by Route L, called "Eternal Snow."</i>

22
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,066
<i>And on a different note,</i>

23
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,200
<i>the same song will be produced</i>
<i>by Kohei Takasu</i>

24
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:55,466
<i>for another newcomer,</i>
<i>Madoka Wakamatsu!</i>

25
00:02:56,666 --> 00:03:00,800
<i>It seems that Kohei Takasu</i>
<i>has a new rival on the scene.</i>

26
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,300
<i>In the 60's, it was common</i>
<i>for two different singers</i>

27
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:08,700
<i>to sing the same song,</i>
<i>as a sort of battle,</i>

28
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:10,633
<i>but nowadays, that's quite rare.</i>

29
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,933
<i>It's going to attract a lot of attention!</i>

30
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:18,400
He's late.

31
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,566
Oh, he's here!

32
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,000
Dr. Wakaoji!

33
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,766
Oh!

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,100
Dr. Wakaoji! You're...

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,766
What? It doesn't look good on me?

36
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,500
I thought I had to change my feelings,
so I thought maybe I'd change my look.

37
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:42,700
No! You look really good!

38
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:44,033
R-Really?

39
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,633
Really!

40
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,933
It's Takasu... So how is it?

41
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,666
Okay, okay.
Keep at it like that.

42
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,900
Yeah, okay...later.

43
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,500
Umm... It will be all right, won't it?

44
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:09,700
You mean... Will you win?

45
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,800
Yes.

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,433
You called me in because
you wanna win, right?

47
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,633
Y-Yes!

48
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:22,300
Then don't make that face
and believe in me!

49
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,933
Okay!

50
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,100
There's the face, that's the true face
of Madoka Wakamatsu.

51
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:28,933
Yes!

52
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:35,800
Yes? Already? You're fast!

53
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:40,866
No, it's not bad.
Just send it my way.

54
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:44,033
What? You sent it already?
You're fast!

55
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:47,833
<i>I will not lose. I can't lose.</i>

56
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,566
I-It's not yet been decided?

57
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,966
Yes.

58
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,500
Isn't that bad?
We're already behind them.

59
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,633
Being first or second isn't the issue.

60
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,066
We have to make something
we are satisfied with.

61
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,000
That's our job.

62
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:09,166
Even so...
What about the schedule?!

63
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:12,966
So you're saying you want
to compromise the quality of the song

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,733
in order to meet the deadline?

65
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:17,866
Compromise? I was just...

66
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:20,466
We can do something
about the schedule,

67
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,500
but we have to decide on
the concept, right?

68
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,766
That's right!

69
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:27,600
If we don't know the concept,
we don't know who to ask to arrange it.

70
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,333
Without that we can't do anything here.

71
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,533
So please decide as soon as possible!

72
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:35,933
Full Moon?

73
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:37,166
Y-Yes?

74
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,066
What is the message you want to
convey to your fans with the song?

75
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,600
My fans? Umm...

76
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:53,100
Well...

77
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,133
Just a general idea is fine.

78
00:05:55,933 --> 00:06:00,133
Yes... Well... That's...

79
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:03,900
It's okay. You don't have to
give me an answer right away.

80
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:07,433
You can take your time
and think about it.

81
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,400
O-Okay.

82
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,900
We're finished for today then.

83
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:13,333
Be seeing you.

84
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,466
Will we make it?

85
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:20,766
I'm worried about this.

86
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:23,700
It's certain he has the talent, but...

87
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:32,033
Don't worry.
Just trust that doctor.

88
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:32,600
Huh?

89
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:36,500
Umm... Well, you seemed concerned
about something so I thought...

90
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:38,466
Oh. I was just thinking.

91
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,733
Up to now, I just thought about
what I wanted to convey to Eichi,

92
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,600
but I realized just now...

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,866
What do I really want to
say with this song?

94
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,833
Oh, that thing...

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,433
Hmm... "Your message," huh?

96
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:01,100
CHILDREN'S DICTIONARY

97
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:02,233
Let's see...

98
00:07:02,966 --> 00:07:05,366
Eternal... Eternal...

99
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:07,033
Eda...mame?

100
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,800
That's not it!

101
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:13,600
What that doctor was trying to
tell you is something much simpler

102
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,166
than understanding the lyrics.

103
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:15,933
What?

104
00:07:16,366 --> 00:07:20,200
For example, when people
hear your "Eternal Snow..."

105
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,933
Will they be unable to stop their tears?

106
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:25,766
Will they feel courageous?

107
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,133
Will they be unable to stop
themselves from smiling?

108
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,933
Or will they be unable
to stop laughing?

109
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:36,100
Hey! That's going too far there.

110
00:07:37,566 --> 00:07:38,466
Oh, I'm sorry.

111
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,133
That's what he meant.

112
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,300
– Oh...
– Oh...

113
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:43,133
So, what do you think?

114
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,700
What? Well...

115
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,566
Well, think about it for a while.

116
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:27,766
Huh?

117
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,566
Did you find your answer?

118
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,833
No.

119
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,833
Don't tell me that you
didn't sleep again.

120
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,366
I did sleep,

121
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,033
but I couldn't stop thinking
about it and I woke up.

122
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:43,966
What were you thinking about?

123
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:49,833
I was wondering what Dad was
thinking when he wrote this song.

124
00:08:49,866 --> 00:08:50,633
Huh?

125
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:54,200
Speaking of which,
what was your dad like?

126
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,900
I don't know, not just my dad,
but my mom too.

127
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,766
Even though they're your parents?

128
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,500
Yeah.

129
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:05,333
According to the teacher
from the orphanage...

130
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:11,366
My mom died right after
she gave birth to me,

131
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,733
and they told me when I was a year old,
my dad became a star in the sky.

132
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,133
Then I heard that my dad was a musician,

133
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:24,466
and that's when I started to listen
to the songs my dad wrote.

134
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:29,600
And two years ago...

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,733
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

136
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:35,433
<i>My name is Mitsuki!</i>

137
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,333
When my grandma took me in,
I tried asking her about that, but...

138
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,066
<i>There is nothing to talk about!</i>

139
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,566
It seemed like Grandma didn't like
being asked about my mom and dad,

140
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,200
and it's been like that
until this very day.

141
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:57,000
Then let's ask that doctor.

142
00:09:57,133 --> 00:09:57,833
What?

143
00:09:58,366 --> 00:10:01,766
Wasn't he in the same band
with your dad?

144
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,300
Yeah, that's a good idea!
You should do that Mitsuki!

145
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,200
You might be able to
find out something.

146
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,933
Yeah!

147
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:16,300
Well, I only knew them
while I was in the band, but...

148
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:22,766
your mother, Hazuki,
used to help out just like that.

149
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:29,633
She was younger than me,
but she was mature like an older sister.

150
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,000
She was a very kind person.

151
00:10:37,366 --> 00:10:41,066
And then one day, they found out
that Hazuki was pregnant.

152
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,033
<i>You're going to elope?!</i>

153
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:45,133
<i>W-Wait a minute!</i>

154
00:10:45,366 --> 00:10:48,500
<i>We're supposed to go on tour,</i>
<i>and if you, the leader, aren't here...</i>

155
00:10:48,866 --> 00:10:49,966
<i>Hello?</i>

156
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:50,966
<i>Hello!</i>

157
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,166
<i>Aoi!</i>

158
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:54,966
She was pregnant with me.

159
00:10:55,566 --> 00:11:00,800
Yeah, but your grandmother
opposed their marriage.

160
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:08,633
Your father, the leader of the band,
left and Route L disbanded.

161
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,966
After that, nobody knew where
your mother and father went to.

162
00:11:13,866 --> 00:11:15,366
But two years ago...

163
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,433
<i>Now, Mitsuki.</i>

164
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:23,733
<i>H-Hello. My name is Mitsuki Koyama.</i>
<i>It's nice to meet you!</i>

165
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:29,766
I thought you looked like her,
and it turned out it really was you.

166
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,733
I kept quiet because of
your grandmother.

167
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,333
Dad, Mom...

168
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,333
So, did that help at all?

169
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,800
Oh, yes.

170
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,333
Umm...

171
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:54,566
Could it be?
Dad wrote that song for Mom?

172
00:11:54,766 --> 00:11:55,866
Could be.

173
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,300
I want to find out more
about my mom and dad.

174
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,600
I wonder if there's anything
that belonged to them.

175
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:04,800
Let's look around.

176
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,000
Yeah. If we look around the house
we might be able to find something.

177
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:09,100
Is there anything?

178
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,833
This is your grandmother
we're talking about.

179
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:12,833
She's probably thrown everything away.

180
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:15,600
You don't know that until you try looking!

181
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,700
But where?

182
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:18,733
Oh! If there is anything,
it should be there!

183
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:19,633
– Huh?
– Huh?

184
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,466
Inside the storage warehouse!

185
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:45,066
<i>I'm unable to come to</i>
<i>the phone right now.</i>

186
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,300
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

187
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:51,633
<i>Hey, Madoka?</i>

188
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:54,766
<i>It's me!</i>
<i>I haven't seen you much lately!</i>

189
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:58,933
<i>Let's go out again like we used to.</i>

190
00:12:59,133 --> 00:13:02,933
<i>It's not like you to get all serious.</i>

191
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:26,133
Full Moon...
I'm not going to lose to you!

192
00:13:38,766 --> 00:13:40,833
Maybe I'm here too early.

193
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:44,633
Good mor—

194
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,166
Mr. Takasu!

195
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,833
Mr. Takasu!

196
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,900
Mr. Takasu...

197
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,900
<i>He's been working all night.</i>

198
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,766
<i>Until now, everybody in this</i>
<i>world was so cold to me.</i>

199
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,433
<i>And for the first time...</i>

200
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:28,766
<i>Mr. Takasu...</i>

201
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:33,900
<i>I'm going to do my best to</i>
<i>meet your expectations!</i>

202
00:14:51,966 --> 00:14:52,600
Oh?

203
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:55,500
Oh, this!

204
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,833
Wow! It's an old RIBBON magazine!

205
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
Mom read RIBBON too!

206
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,500
That's so great!

207
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,633
Let me see.

208
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,833
– Look, Meroko!
– This is so funny!

209
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:11,166
Hey! Are we supposed to
fool around right now?

210
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:12,700
Oh, you're right.

211
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:14,966
Cripes!

212
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:24,033
Huh?

213
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:31,566
A rat! A rat!

214
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,033
I hate rats!

215
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,100
– This looks newer than the other things.
– Oh, I hate rats!

216
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:38,666
No!

217
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,266
Takuto!

218
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,033
Watch out!

219
00:15:44,066 --> 00:15:44,733
Huh?

220
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,333
This...

221
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,066
That box seems relatively new
compared to the others.

222
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,600
Open it.

223
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:01,433
Yeah.

224
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:03,766
Oh! That was close.

225
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,033
But...

226
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:07,733
I was really shocked!

227
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:08,900
This again?

228
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:15,733
Me?

229
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,533
What is it?

230
00:16:20,933 --> 00:16:23,500
No... It's not me.

231
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:24,300
– Huh?
– Huh?

232
00:16:24,866 --> 00:16:26,866
That's my mom.

233
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:32,666
Oh! You look exactly like her.

234
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:33,433
Yeah.

235
00:16:33,533 --> 00:16:34,333
Oh?

236
00:16:37,766 --> 00:16:40,666
Oh? A musical jewelry box?

237
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,433
What?

238
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,400
Is it broken?

239
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:52,133
Oh?

240
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:56,800
H-Hey.

241
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,966
Look at this.

242
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:02,533
"To Hazuki with Love."

243
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:03,800
Hmm?

244
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,633
For Hazuki with all his love.

245
00:17:05,966 --> 00:17:08,200
What? Then, Dad gave this to her?

246
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:09,733
Probably.

247
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,900
A music box that Dad gave to Mom.

248
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,800
It's inside here.

249
00:17:37,533 --> 00:17:41,033
Dad's feelings for Mom.

250
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,800
You're right.

251
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,100
I want to hear.

252
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,900
Dad's feelings...

253
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:05,166
Wow!

254
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,500
It's a nice song.

255
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:24,333
Yeah!

256
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,066
What do you think?

257
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:47,966
It's warm.

258
00:18:48,066 --> 00:18:48,833
– Huh?
– Huh?

259
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:54,633
It's warm...this feeling,
I don't know how else to describe it.

260
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:58,333
Oh! I wish I could express
it in better in words!

261
00:19:02,633 --> 00:19:04,000
Hey, it's a phone call.

262
00:19:04,133 --> 00:19:05,166
Y-Yeah.

263
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:07,633
Oh! Mitsuki?

264
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,400
We got a job just now!
Can you come out now?!

265
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:11,300
<i>Y-Yes.</i>

266
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,033
Then I'll see you outside the fence.

267
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:14,033
<i>Okay!</i>

268
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:16,066
I have a job right now!

269
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,000
What?!

270
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,500
Hurry! I'll stay here for you!

271
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,100
Yeah!

272
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:44,133
Huh?!

273
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,233
What?!

274
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:46,666
D-Did she find us?!

275
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:47,933
Here!

276
00:19:57,066 --> 00:19:59,033
– Did she...
– ...figure it out?

277
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,766
Hazuki...

278
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,600
Huh?

279
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,333
Hazuki...

280
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:17,933
<i>Hazuki! Where are you going?!</i>

281
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:20,266
<i>I'm pregnant with his baby.</i>

282
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:23,233
<i>What?! That man's child?!</i>

283
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:27,366
<i>I'm going to leave this house</i>
<i>if you can't accept him.</i>

284
00:20:27,966 --> 00:20:28,833
<i>Hazuki!</i>

285
00:20:30,066 --> 00:20:33,633
<i>If you have a child with</i>
<i>your weak body...</i>

286
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,000
<i>Hazuki!</i>

287
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,600
Music...

288
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,200
I hate music.

289
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,233
It always takes away
what's precious to me.

290
00:21:17,566 --> 00:21:19,066
Where did you get that?

291
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:22,366
It was a present from
my dad to my mom.

292
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,966
Ms. Oshige, I figured out my message.

293
00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:29,200
What is it?

294
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:33,733
I want to warm people's hearts with music.

295
00:21:34,366 --> 00:21:36,566
Even those who hate music.

296
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,766
I want them to like music.

297
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:45,033
<i>Isn't that right, Mom? Dad?</i>

298
00:23:18,433 --> 00:23:19,866
Oh no, Takuto!
It's in the tabloids...

299
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:24,766
"Full Moon and Doctor Wakaoji
are madly in love!"

300
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,366
Huh? That's impossible.

301
00:23:27,466 --> 00:23:29,133
How could that happen?

302
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:32,166
Seems like Madoka is
up to no good again.

303
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,966
That girl just doesn't give up!

304
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:37,133
Just when we thought we got away,
here comes more trouble!

305
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,666
At this rate, how are we going
to do the recording.

306
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:41,500
What do we do?

307
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:45,466
Next time on Full Moon:
"I Won't Lose"

308
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,166
– Look forward to it!
– Look forward to it!
