1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,133
This is Mitsuki Koyama,
12 years old.

2
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:12,766
She's made it to her debut day,
but at her first performance,

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,900
she got nervous and doubted her ability
to even sing in front of people!

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,500
Well, she is in grade school...
Who can blame her?

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,333
But...with everyone's support,

6
00:00:20,366 --> 00:00:21,766
she was able
to give a great performance!

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,866
Up next is MY Full Moon Meroko Debut!

8
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:27,833
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

9
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:33,633
Got that?

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,633
Yes.

11
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:14,966
<i>Why do I like you so much?</i>

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,166
<i>Your voice echoes
and it sounds almost sad.</i>

13
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,200
<i>Up to now who was supporting me?</i>

14
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:35,033
<i>I realize, now that I'm far away,
what was supporting me.</i>

15
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,900
<i>"Myself" By Full Moon
IN STORES NOW</i>

16
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:41,833
It's so pretty...

17
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,300
Was that really me?

18
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:47,900
You're the new face that
Seed Records is really pushing,

19
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:50,800
so we went a little bit further with
the promotional video.

20
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:53,766
But I wonder if everyone will buy it.

21
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,966
It's no good to lose your confidence
after it goes on sale.

22
00:02:57,533 --> 00:02:59,500
There is no doubt that it's a good song,

23
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:02,033
and from now on it's going
to sell like hotcakes!

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,366
Jeez, that's annoying!

25
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,433
Stay still for a minute!

26
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:19,433
I can't calm down until I hear from
Ms. Oshige about the CD sales.

27
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,966
C'mon, spare me!

28
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:24,700
Hurry up and call, Manager!

29
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,100
It's her!

30
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:29,666
Hello?

31
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,133
Yes... Really?
I understand.

32
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:38,533
- How...
- Was it?

33
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,500
Well... Uh...

34
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,633
Don't get so depressed
if it didn't sell.

35
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,866
It's just went
on sale yesterday, right?

36
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:49,666
The battle has just begun, right?

37
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,433
I did it!

38
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:53,666
It's selling like crazy!

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,933
They were bombarded with orders!
She said it's going to keep selling!

40
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:00,400
What was that?

41
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:02,000
How could you make us worry?!

42
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:06,600
This means that a lot of people
are gonna listen to my song!

43
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:10,300
My intuition tells me
it's going to keep selling and selling.

44
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,200
It will definitely sell a million copies!

45
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,666
I'm so happy!

46
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:17,166
That's great.

47
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,733
Yeah!

48
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,633
Today, everyone at your school will be
talking all about Full Moon, right?

49
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:23,866
I know!

50
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,633
Take a CD to school today.

51
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:27,733
What?

52
00:04:28,366 --> 00:04:31,400
You can brag and say
"I have a Full Moon CD."

53
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:32,200
I can?

54
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:33,933
That would be good if I really can.

55
00:04:34,033 --> 00:04:35,900
I'm looking forward to
everyone's response.

56
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:38,533
Ah, that's right. If we do that,
we need to practice our autograph.

57
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,200
Hey!

58
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,566
It's not you, it's Full Moon who's—

59
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,566
Hey!

60
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:47,666
Wouldn't it be cute
if I wore a ribbon?

61
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:50,933
Meroko, quit it already!

62
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,333
Speaking in such a loud voice,
it's disgraceful.

63
00:04:57,633 --> 00:04:58,833
Good morning.

64
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,366
Good morning!

65
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:15,566
What's wrong?

66
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,733
I get excited and nervous when
I think about what everyone is saying.

67
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,433
Are they really listening to "Myself"?

68
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,666
Everything's fine.
After all, it's selling like crazy, isn't it?

69
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,433
Have confidence.
I know. Try taking a deep breath.

70
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,166
Right.

71
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:36,966
I've calmed down a little bit.

72
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,100
Well good!

73
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,800
Yeah!

74
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,066
Good morning.

75
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:42,666
Oh, Mitsuki!

76
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,500
Good morning.

77
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:44,166
Morning.

78
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:48,700
Morning, Kumi.

79
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:51,633
You're super early today, Kumi.

80
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:52,633
Isn't that okay?

81
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,733
But more importantly, hey!

82
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:56,366
Did you hear that new song
that went on sale yesterday?

83
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:57,266
Huh?

84
00:05:57,533 --> 00:06:00,466
I heard it.
The vocals are the best, aren't they?

85
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:05,100
- It's by Fu...Fu...
- Fu...Fu...

86
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:05,800
<i>Full Moon!</i>

87
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,233
- It's Full Moon.
- It's Full Moon.

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,733
Furuta?

89
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:11,833
Of the Guitar Fighters?

90
00:06:11,866 --> 00:06:12,933
Yeah, that's it!

91
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:15,066
Tomoe, that's just what I'd expect from
a member of the broadcast club.

92
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:18,866
Naturally! I'm on top of
all the new releases.

93
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:19,800
Well then...

94
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,033
What is she doing?

95
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:22,733
She should get into the conversation.

96
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:23,533
That's right.

97
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,100
Hey, yesterday on TV...

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,100
I was surprised.
She was so pretty.

99
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:33,466
Oh, that. The thing that was
on the entertainment news?

100
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:35,933
Norika Matsushima's Commissioner
for a Day !

101
00:06:42,566 --> 00:06:44,233
What happened, Koyama?

102
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:46,300
Are you not feeling well again?

103
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,766
I-It's nothing.

104
00:06:49,766 --> 00:06:50,666
Thank you.

105
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:51,733
Really?

106
00:06:51,766 --> 00:06:53,366
I guess that's good then.

107
00:07:06,266 --> 00:07:08,600
Nobody was talking about it.

108
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,966
If you're so concerned about it,
don't worry so much about gossip.

109
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:17,333
You should just ask them.

110
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,333
Yeah, but...

111
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:22,233
Is it possible that
you don't have any friends?

112
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,633
There's no reason for that!

113
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:27,966
It's been two years since
she changed schools.

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,700
Yeah...

115
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:30,733
Takuto is right...

116
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:34,366
I was absent for a long time
because I was sick.

117
00:07:35,766 --> 00:07:38,333
When it comes to Gym,
I have to sit out and watch

118
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:40,900
and I'm not allowed to watch a lot of TV.

119
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:45,333
It's hard to make close friends,
with nothing to talk about.

120
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,500
I see... I'm sorry.

121
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:50,366
That's okay!

122
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,400
I was told that it's selling,

123
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:56,100
it was wrong to think that
everyone should have heard it.

124
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:58,800
I'm sorry too,
that I made you worry.

125
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:21,366
We HAVE to do this!

126
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,400
What is it, all of a sudden?

127
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:24,300
Look!

128
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,300
School lunchtime program.
Now accepting requests?

129
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,366
What's that?

130
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,000
During lunch break,

131
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:35,133
a member of the broadcast club is
a DJ who plays songs and chats.

132
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:37,666
It's pretty popular.

133
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,366
- That's why!
- Oh, I get it!

134
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:40,266
Huh?

135
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:42,300
You're so dull.

136
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:46,200
If nobody's heard it,
we'll make them listen to it.

137
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,333
What?

138
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:50,066
Do it.

139
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:53,400
You should take your CD
to the broadcast room.

140
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,166
Yes, but...

141
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,800
But...

142
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh c'mon!
You're so frustrating!

143
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:02,200
If you hesitate too much,
you'll turn into a fly.

144
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,400
It's easy to give up,

145
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:06,633
but before you do
you should try a little bit harder.

146
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:07,866
That's right!

147
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,900
You worked so hard
for your debut, didn't you?

148
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,700
You're right.
I'll give it a try.

149
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:19,433
No, not "I'll give it a try."
Just go for it!

150
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,633
W-Wait a minute!

151
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:25,133
I'm still in the middle of thinking about
whether I should request it or not.

152
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:26,800
Are you saying those things again?

153
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,333
Aw, if it's come to this.

154
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:35,200
Mero-Mero Magic!

155
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,900
Hey! My CD!

156
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,633
I'm going to go request it!

157
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,100
Meroko, wait!

158
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:47,266
I can't believe it, that fool.

159
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,133
I said wait!

160
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:53,133
Stop, please!

161
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:55,833
Look at that.
Isn't that Mitsuki?

162
00:09:55,866 --> 00:09:57,133
What a sight.

163
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:58,500
She's strange.

164
00:09:58,533 --> 00:09:59,733
She's so funny.

165
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,566
Oh... H-Hello...

166
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,966
<i>Everyone's laughing
their hearts out at me.</i>

167
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,633
She did it, that Meroko.

168
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:10,533
Meroko, stop!

169
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,833
Stop, Meroko!

170
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,400
That's the broadcast room.

171
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,566
- Don't stop so suddenly!
- Don't stop so suddenly!

172
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,566
Oh, Mitsuki?

173
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:30,066
What are you doing there?

174
00:10:30,366 --> 00:10:31,933
Tomoe?

175
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:32,133
Tomoe?

176
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:34,400
Okay? Hand it over to
the broadcast club member

177
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,766
say that you'd like to request it.

178
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,966
It can't be helped.
Prepare yourself!

179
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:41,133
Are you okay?

180
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,733
I, uh...

181
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,066
U-Umm...

182
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,466
Oh!

183
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,766
Come on!

184
00:10:51,466 --> 00:10:52,666
W-What's this?

185
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,333
Everything's fine, just be quiet.

186
00:10:54,366 --> 00:10:56,400
Play "Myself"!

187
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,800
No, I mean would you play it?

188
00:10:58,833 --> 00:10:59,933
Please?

189
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:02,133
Meroko?

190
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,533
I wonder what Mitsuki's doing.

191
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,933
I wonder if she's fighting
with Tomoe or something?

192
00:11:09,566 --> 00:11:11,066
S-Stop it, Meroko.

193
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,400
But you have to request it.

194
00:11:12,433 --> 00:11:14,100
It's okay...
So just stop it!

195
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,533
Um... Mitsuki...
What's going on?

196
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,333
I'm sorry!

197
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:28,800
Oops!

198
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:33,633
M-Mitsuki, are you okay?

199
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,900
If I keep doing
these strange things,

200
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:40,166
it's gonna get even more
difficult to talk to people.

201
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:05,800
I didn't hand over my CD,
all I do is make blunders.

202
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:06,733
It was a disaster.

203
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:08,233
That's true.

204
00:12:08,266 --> 00:12:10,133
Whose fault do you think it is?

205
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,100
Tomoe.

206
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:20,166
Here's your chance.
It's another chance to ask for your request.

207
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:21,833
Should I?

208
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,033
Yes you should!

209
00:12:23,266 --> 00:12:24,400
Fine, fine...

210
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,766
Uh, Tomoe?

211
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:32,266
Yes, hello...

212
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,500
Well, maybe she went to buy "Myself."

213
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:40,600
If you keep saying things like that
you're just building up expectation!

214
00:12:40,866 --> 00:12:42,600
But, look at that.

215
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:51,833
Oh, "Myself" by Full Moon?

216
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:53,100
See!

217
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:55,666
It's completely...
no good, no good.

218
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,066
- What?!
- What?

219
00:12:57,633 --> 00:12:58,733
Yeah, that's right.

220
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:02,566
And tomorrow I'm going to
Shibuya with my mom.

221
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,833
I'm looking forward to it.

222
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:06,500
No good...
What does she mean by that?

223
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:13,900
I'm home.

224
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,666
Oh...

225
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,833
What happened?
You're injured.

226
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,366
This...

227
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,466
Lately you've been laughing so loudly,
it's like you're too giddy.

228
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:34,133
You've got to worry about your health.

229
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,933
From now on,
please be careful.

230
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,533
You understand, don't you?

231
00:13:39,133 --> 00:13:40,133
Yes.

232
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,566
This taiyaki is super delicious!

233
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,433
See, see! It smells good, right?
How about it?

234
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,600
No, thank you.

235
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,433
What are you talking about?

236
00:13:56,566 --> 00:13:58,800
It's filled with bean paste right down
to the tail!

237
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,866
It's from that bakery called Shunpu,
in front of the train station.

238
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,000
If you don't eat it, you'll regret it.

239
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,066
See, see!

240
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,700
See!
Aw, c'mon!

241
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,966
If I say I don't want it, I don't want it!

242
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,400
Yes...

243
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,266
Ah, Mitsuki?

244
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,300
It's Oshige.

245
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:23,666
"Myself" is making a huge impact.

246
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,933
<i>We're getting one supplementary order
after another from the CD shop.</i>

247
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:30,400
<i>It's the first big hit for a talent
that I'm responsible for.</i>

248
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,766
You say it's a hit, but is that true?

249
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,666
Of course.

250
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
The radio and TV stations are saying
that they want you to perform soon!

251
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,933
Can you hear?

252
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:44,066
And my phone keeps
ringing off the hook.

253
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,033
Really?
But nobody knows about it...

254
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:50,666
<i>What?
Mitsuki... Hello Mitsuki?</i>

255
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,066
It's nothing. Goodbye.

256
00:14:57,033 --> 00:14:58,866
Your manager will worry.

257
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,100
But nobody's heard it.
How can it be called a hit?

258
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:04,300
That's ...

259
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,466
B-But there was
so much advertising...

260
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:11,100
Even if there's a lot of advertising,
it's no good if nobody hears it.

261
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:12,400
And...

262
00:15:13,033 --> 00:15:18,566
<i>"Myself" by Full Moon?
Oh, it's completely... no good, no good.</i>

263
00:15:22,866 --> 00:15:23,666
Sorry...

264
00:15:24,366 --> 00:15:26,200
Please leave me alone...

265
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,700
and don't come to school
with me anymore.

266
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:36,600
I'm going now.

267
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,400
Good morning!

268
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:44,700
Good morning!

269
00:15:51,866 --> 00:15:53,700
Somehow, it's painful to go in.

270
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,900
You came this far,
so what are you saying?

271
00:15:58,366 --> 00:15:59,066
Takuto!

272
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,966
Sorry...about yesterday

273
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,100
That's okay.

274
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:05,633
More importantly, if you get
disheartened over that,

275
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,500
you won't be able to do
what's ahead of you.

276
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,733
But I thought I'd be able to talk
to everyone about Full Moon.

277
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:14,466
I felt so ill at ease with everyone.

278
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,600
Hey!

279
00:16:15,966 --> 00:16:18,666
If you want to hear a song,
you sing it yourself, right?

280
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:20,433
Friends are the same.

281
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,766
If you can't try to fit in,
you can't make friends.

282
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:27,300
The same as singing?

283
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:29,033
What I'm saying is that...

284
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,066
Before you worry about things like

285
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,233
not having a friend or
that you can't make conversation,

286
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,133
you just have to laugh and
talk to someone!

287
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,800
I see...
It's the same as singing.

288
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,566
That's right.
Anyway, give it a try.

289
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:44,566
I wonder if I can do it.

290
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,733
I taught you yesterday, right?

291
00:16:45,766 --> 00:16:47,300
At times like that...

292
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,633
- take a deep breath!
- take a deep breath!

293
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:55,433
That's it.
First, I'll smile...

294
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Well then!

295
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:59,600
Come over. Take a look!

296
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:01,233
Ah... That voice?

297
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:02,800
- Meroko!
- Meroko!

298
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,033
Lined up here we have

299
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,566
the new song that was just
put on sale yesterday!

300
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,633
Right now, it's a super big hit
on the streets!

301
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:18,800
It's really hard to get your hands on!

302
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,600
I'm secretly offering
the special "friend" discount!

303
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,233
C'mon, buy it, buy it!

304
00:17:28,633 --> 00:17:30,333
That's my CD.

305
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,000
What is she doing?

306
00:17:32,066 --> 00:17:35,033
Did Mitsuki's personality
just change?

307
00:17:35,566 --> 00:17:37,633
I didn't think
she was this kind of person...

308
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,166
She's totally different from her image!

309
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:43,533
That's horrible, horrible, Meroko!

310
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,033
What do you think you're doing?!

311
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:50,633
Well...

312
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,133
I kind of felt bad about yesterday.

313
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:59,033
If you're reflecting on your conduct,
why would you act like that?

314
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,700
If everyone listened to Full Moon,

315
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:05,500
it would be a good plan for Mitsuki
to get close to making some friends.

316
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,433
Well, there's a problem with
the way that you did it!

317
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:11,866
I thought that would
be the quickest way!

318
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,700
You know...

319
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:15,166
It's okay, Takuto.

320
00:18:15,633 --> 00:18:16,233
What?

321
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:21,600
It's okay...
Meroko was just doing it for me.

322
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,466
On top of that, I haven't had friends
since the beginning,

323
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,133
so it doesn't change anything now.

324
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,466
I have to go.

325
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:44,333
I thought it was a good idea.

326
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,900
She's here, she's here.

327
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,166
We were looking for you, Mitsuki!

328
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,100
What?

329
00:18:56,066 --> 00:18:59,866
Is it okay if I use this CD for
the lunchtime broadcast?

330
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:00,966
What!

331
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:05,100
But yesterday you said "Myself"
by Full Moon was completely no good.

332
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,300
That's right!

333
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,700
They weren't selling it anywhere,
I couldn't get my hands on it.

334
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:13,166
I was thinking that I'd have to go
to Shibuya and buy it.

335
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:14,600
It's really popular.

336
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:17,466
The lyrics are good and
the singing is the best.

337
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,666
Especially that one part...

338
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:21,600
<i>Why do I like you so much?</i>

339
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,300
It's different, it's like this.

340
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:25,733
<i>Why do I like you so much?</i>

341
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:27,166
Huh?
Something's different.

342
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,033
Is it?

343
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,533
I'm sure it's like this...

344
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:32,666
<i>Why do I like you so much?</i>

345
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,266
It's different.

346
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,166
You think so?

347
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,466
Isn't it like this?

348
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:41,700
Say...

349
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:42,366
Huh?

350
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:43,733
Isn't it like this?

351
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:52,300
<i>Why do I like you so much?</i>

352
00:19:52,600 --> 00:20:00,233
<i>Your voice is enough
to make me sad.</i>

353
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:10,633
Oh...I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have done that.

354
00:20:10,966 --> 00:20:12,500
Wow... Amazing!

355
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:14,233
Mitsuki, you're like the real thing.

356
00:20:14,266 --> 00:20:15,200
That's cool!

357
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:16,566
Oh...really?

358
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:19,566
Yeah. Mitsuki you're really good
at singing.

359
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,600
It's not just singing.
That sales technique from before...

360
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,533
Yeah, that was funny.

361
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:27,666
- Umm... That was umm...
- We didn't know you were that interesting.

362
00:20:27,766 --> 00:20:29,833
From now on, let's chat more.

363
00:20:29,866 --> 00:20:31,033
And teach us songs.

364
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,700
Yeah.

365
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,600
If you're okay with me,
I'll teach you as many as you want!

366
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,633
Mitsuki! Oh, is it okay
to call you Mitsuki?

367
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,133
Shall we go to
the broadcast room together?

368
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,100
I'll give you a tour, and show you
how to do a broadcast.

369
00:20:41,466 --> 00:20:42,566
C'mon, c'mon!

370
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,000
Okay, I'd like to go and see it.

371
00:20:44,366 --> 00:20:46,500
You can call me Tomoe.

372
00:20:47,966 --> 00:20:50,866
Thank goodness, with that,
the case is closed.

373
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,066
Meroko, I'm sorry I said such
a horrible thing.

374
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,633
Takuto, thank you.

375
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,133
Mitsuki, everything okay?

376
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,900
It's nothing, I'm coming.

377
00:21:02,633 --> 00:21:04,766
Of course!
It's thank to me.

378
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,200
If it weren't for me there would
be no Full Moon, right, Takuto?

379
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,400
Don't let it go to your head.

380
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,333
They're waiting
for a new shipment.

381
00:21:15,966 --> 00:21:19,466
It's really selling.
Production can't keep up.

382
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,666
You can believe that everyone wants
to hear Full Moon's songs.

383
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:24,600
Yes, I know.

384
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:25,866
That's why!

385
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:27,200
Huh?

386
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:31,200
Yes, I understand well.
A lot of people are listening to it.

387
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:33,533
I'll work hard from now on!

388
00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:37,266
With a deep breath and a smile!

389
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,700
Hmm, I guess it's okay then!

390
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,600
Takuto, what's the matter?

391
00:23:22,633 --> 00:23:25,733
That Dr. Wakaoji, I don't know
what he's thinking.

392
00:23:25,766 --> 00:23:29,166
He won't listen to "Myself"
even with Mitsuki's prodding!

393
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,466
Huh?! I wonder why?
It's such a good song!

394
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,600
I know, right?

395
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:36,266
Well, he did say he used
to be a musician!

396
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,000
Is there something going on
we don't know about?

397
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:42,066
Next time on Full Moon:
"I Want You to Hear It!"

398
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:43,566
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
