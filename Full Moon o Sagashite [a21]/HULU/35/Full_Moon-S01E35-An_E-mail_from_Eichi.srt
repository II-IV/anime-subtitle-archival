1
00:00:05,866 --> 00:00:07,966
At this rose garden
that overlooks the ocean,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,066
we meet Mr. Sanada, who can see
Death Spirits just like Mitsuki can!

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,966
Mr. Sanada is a gentle man who
seems to have accepted his destiny.

4
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:19,600
And on his fated day, Mitsuki
has a heart to heart with him

5
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:21,466
just as his soul
is being collected.

6
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:24,133
I wonder how she felt back there.

7
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:27,833
So, I wonder what's
going to happen today...

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,600
Got that?

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,666
Yes.

10
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:50,300
What?

11
00:02:55,766 --> 00:02:56,766
Everyone?

12
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,500
Ms. Oshige? Dr. Wakaoji?

13
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,366
Takuto? Meroko?

14
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:11,133
Why?

15
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,266
The reason's simple.

16
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,966
You're going to die soon.

17
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,466
It was a dream?

18
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:44,233
What's wrong?

19
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:47,400
It's still night.

20
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:49,333
It's nothing.

21
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
I'm okay.

22
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:10,033
Hey, Mitsuki.

23
00:04:10,766 --> 00:04:11,766
Mitsuki?

24
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:17,433
Ow, ow...
What're you doing?

25
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:21,633
I've been calling you many times,
but you act like you don't notice.

26
00:04:21,966 --> 00:04:23,733
Ta-dah. Look at this.

27
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,400
Orientation for advancement
into junior high school?

28
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,100
Yeah. We're finally going to be
junior high school students next spring.

29
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,000
Next...spring...

30
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,566
The school uniforms we've longed for.
Wonderful upperclassmen...

31
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:44,900
Let me tell you though, the studies are
going to be tough in our junior high school.

32
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,600
Why did you say such
a pessimistic thing?

33
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:51,466
Say, Mitsuki. How about joining
the Judo club with me in junior high?

34
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,400
A manga study club
would be nice too.

35
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:56,400
Wait, we need to ask Mitsuki
what she wants to do.

36
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:58,933
That's right.
What do you want to do?

37
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,733
You haven't decided, yet?

38
00:05:01,766 --> 00:05:03,866
N-No. Not yet.

39
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,933
I see. Then take your time
and think about it. Okay?

40
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:08,966
O-Okay.

41
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:13,400
By next spring, that girl will...

42
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:22,166
Grandma, may I come in?

43
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:27,800
What do you want, Mitsuki?

44
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,033
Oh... Umm... I...

45
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,066
It's nothing.

46
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,000
Good night then.

47
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:48,033
Jeez, what's with that attitude?!
She makes me mad!

48
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,400
Whoa. C-Calm down, Meroko!

49
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,600
I'm calm!

50
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,900
How is this calm?!

51
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,100
Since I won't be able to talk with
Grandma after next spring,

52
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:11,300
I wanted to reconcile with her
while I had the chance, but...

53
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:16,300
I failed!

54
00:06:22,433 --> 00:06:23,433
<i>Mitsuki...</i>

55
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:27,900
Good morning.

56
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,700
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

57
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,266
Oh, Ms. Oshige!

58
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,333
Excuse me,
do you have a moment?

59
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,166
Sure.

60
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:37,733
You go on ahead.

61
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,766
Okay.

62
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,400
<i>You're going to die soon.</i>

63
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,633
<i>You're going to die.</i>

64
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,566
Mitsuki!

65
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:13,466
Are you okay?

66
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:22,666
Umm... Umm... I...

67
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,166
THE GREEN TOWN
"Summer Vacation Special Drama."

68
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,966
Half a year from now, huh?

69
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,033
Her health is an issue,
so I have to consult with everyone.

70
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,133
If you're scared, say so.

71
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,166
Takuto...

72
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,366
Mitsuki, it's okay to say
you're scared if you're scared.

73
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,166
Because wanting to live
is human instinct.

74
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,166
Huh?

75
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:56,133
Th-Thanks, Takuto.
But I'm fine.

76
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:58,200
Fine?

77
00:07:58,766 --> 00:08:00,533
I'm really fine!

78
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:04,000
Hey, I'm going to change,
so go outside.

79
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:13,000
What're you thinking,
saying such a thing, Takuto?

80
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,566
It's good that she isn't
as scared as I thought.

81
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:21,300
But what would you have done
if she said she was scared?

82
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:23,666
There's nothing we can do.

83
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:27,033
Do you really think
she's not scared?

84
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,066
What?

85
00:08:28,766 --> 00:08:31,800
She's scared.
She's gotten scared!

86
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:39,100
Of course she is.
She's still 12 years old!

87
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,900
But even so,
she's working as hard as she can.

88
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,366
Takuto...

89
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:49,100
She tries really hard...
to say she's not.

90
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:54,633
She's saying she's fine,
so isn't that okay?

91
00:08:56,266 --> 00:09:00,333
I don't care about Mitsuki's feelings
in the first place.

92
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:01,200
Meroko...

93
00:09:01,466 --> 00:09:04,900
This is why I didn't want to
get chummy with a child.

94
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:07,433
It just makes the job painful.

95
00:09:07,766 --> 00:09:09,600
Are you being serious?!

96
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,233
A-Anyway,
I don't want to do this anymore!

97
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:14,100
Meroko!

98
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:19,066
Dammit!

99
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,000
How complicated.

100
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,666
They're on bad terms.

101
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,166
That's perfect.

102
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,233
With this, there will be more
chances to get close to Mero.

103
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:33,266
She's too good for Takuto.

104
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:37,633
But you snubbed her
when she hit on you!

105
00:09:39,766 --> 00:09:42,933
Let me out! It's dark!

106
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,733
Good work today!

107
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,200
- Good work today!
- Good work today!

108
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:50,733
Yes.

109
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:56,100
Yes. Of course we're happy to accept.
We look forward to working with you.

110
00:09:57,066 --> 00:09:58,466
What were you talking about?

111
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:00,700
I accepted a drama job for you.

112
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,766
Drama?

113
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:04,200
It's a good offer.

114
00:10:04,566 --> 00:10:08,033
It's half a year from now,
but they're saying you'll be the star

115
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:11,000
and your third single will be
the main theme song.

116
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,000
Half a year from now...

117
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:14,533
It'll be okay!

118
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:16,733
I'll find a way to make it happen,
no matter what.

119
00:10:20,766 --> 00:10:23,233
You'll be in a drama,
make the song a hit,

120
00:10:23,266 --> 00:10:26,866
and we'll do our best together half a year
from now, a year from now, and forever!

121
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:29,166
Okay, Mitsuki?

122
00:10:30,366 --> 00:10:31,633
Ms. Oshige...

123
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,800
I'm home.

124
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:36,566
Welcome home.

125
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:42,933
A friend of yours delivered this while
you were out with Ms. Oshige.

126
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:43,633
What?

127
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,800
It's about the club activities
we were talking about yesterday.

128
00:10:48,466 --> 00:10:53,700
<i>I'm sorry I asked you to join the Judo club</i>
<i>with me without thinking about your health.</i>

129
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,766
<i>We asked the teacher, and there are</i>
<i>lots of activities that you can do too.</i>

130
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,666
<i>We're writing them down here in hopes</i>
<i>that there'll be an activity you want to do.</i>

131
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,200
<i>Personally, I think you should</i>
<i>do the manga study club.</i>

132
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:12,033
Jeez, you guys!

133
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:31,533
I wonder if I was too hard on Takuto.
I guess I should head back.

134
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,966
I-Izumi?!

135
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:41,000
W-What did you come here for?!

136
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,633
You'd know if I said I'd only
come to the human world

137
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,866
for one reason other
than work, right?

138
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:49,133
Stop it!

139
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,466
You used to follow me
around so much.

140
00:11:52,766 --> 00:11:56,133
That was then, this is now.
I think nothing of you now!

141
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,633
I'm dedicated to Takuto now!

142
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:01,966
Do you like Takuto that much?

143
00:12:02,866 --> 00:12:06,500
Takuto's heart has
been stolen by Mitsuki.

144
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:14,400
A-Anyway, just go on home already!

145
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:28,466
You're the best, Mero.
You're really the best!

146
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:47,600
Mitsuki, where are you going?

147
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:49,600
It's almost time for dinner.

148
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:52,933
Y-Yeah, Dr. Wakaoji called me in.

149
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,633
Anyway, I'll be back.

150
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:56,133
Mitsuki!

151
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:01,733
What's all the ruckus?

152
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,533
Oh, Mitsuki said she was called in
by Dr. Wakaoji. Umm...

153
00:13:07,766 --> 00:13:08,766
Leave her be.

154
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:17,033
Don't rush so fast.
You'll trip and fall!

155
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:18,266
But...

156
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,666
Mitsuki!

157
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,633
Dr. Wakaoji.

158
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,933
What's everyone all flustered about?
What the heck is going on?

159
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,166
Well...

160
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,900
Is that true?
I got an email from Eichi?

161
00:13:39,133 --> 00:13:42,933
It's true. An email was sent to
the Full Moon official homepage.

162
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:44,433
Here, look.

163
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,200
I was surprised when
I heard the song.

164
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:54,633
Mitsuki, you made your dream
of becoming a singer come true.

165
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:57,900
I'm doing my best in America
to make my dream

166
00:13:57,933 --> 00:14:00,533
of becoming an astronomer
come true.

167
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:01,933
From Eichi.

168
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:06,133
It was sent with a free email address,
so we don't know where he is.

169
00:14:06,366 --> 00:14:09,100
But now we can get a lead
as to where he is.

170
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:12,033
I can't believe it.

171
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:23,266
Eichi...

172
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,033
You should ask him when
he's coming back to Japan.

173
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:28,133
Right!

174
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,766
All right! With this,
Mitsuki's dream will come true.

175
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,833
And what's more,
it'll be just the two of us.

176
00:14:35,866 --> 00:14:37,233
We'll be madly in love!

177
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:52,266
Oh, Takuto...

178
00:14:56,766 --> 00:14:59,566
To think that even the color of
the sun would look different

179
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,133
just by getting
an email from Eichi.

180
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:07,966
It's a wonder.

181
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,500
More, please.

182
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:15,666
Oh, again? You've got quite
an appetite this morning.

183
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,600
I got up kind of early,
so I got hungry.

184
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:24,833
This is a surprise.

185
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,433
Am I getting worse?

186
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,400
No, just the opposite.
You've gotten a lot better.

187
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,733
That's the Eichi effect.

188
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,400
The Eichi effect?

189
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,800
It seems there are many cases
of incurable diseases

190
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:42,366
being cured by strengthened immunity
due to being happy and laughing.

191
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:46,800
I'm a doctor, and I've been put to shame.
I surrender to Eichi.

192
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,500
Strange.

193
00:15:53,766 --> 00:15:55,466
Even though it looks like
her sickness is going to be cured,

194
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,400
no keywords are appearing.

195
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,333
I wonder if this means that
there are no particular problems.

196
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:02,433
Meroko.

197
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,466
Huh?

198
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,933
Doesn't that email bother you?

199
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:06,966
Why?

200
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,666
No particular reason, but...

201
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:14,200
He probably listened to the CD that
the teacher from the orphanage gave him.

202
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,533
Why don't you just be happy for
Mitsuki, who's doing her best?

203
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:26,533
Okay, I have a meeting,
so you go on ahead.

204
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,300
Yes, all right.

205
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:39,966
What?

206
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,000
Huh?

207
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:46,500
Wasn't the dressing room up?

208
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:49,366
That's strange.
Anyway, let's try going down.

209
00:17:04,266 --> 00:17:08,166
Why won't it stop?
It keeps going up.

210
00:17:23,466 --> 00:17:24,466
The roof?

211
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:38,766
I've been waiting.

212
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:43,700
W-What?

213
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:45,233
What is this?

214
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:49,600
Ow, ow, ow...

215
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:54,166
Oh no.

216
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:56,900
I-It doesn't look like she's here.

217
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:16,933
W-What did you come here for?

218
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:20,733
Everyone asks me the same thing.

219
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:24,700
It's boring always giving
the same answer, so...

220
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:31,533
Let me see. I guess I'll say something like,
Mitsuki, I've come to take your life early.

221
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:35,333
B-But my life isn't over yet!

222
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,466
So I'll just take a reservation.

223
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,866
Take the Death Spirit Seal, Mitsuki.

224
00:18:47,766 --> 00:18:48,833
N-No!

225
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,566
She's not here yet.

226
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,533
I really wonder where she went.

227
00:18:58,766 --> 00:18:59,766
<i>N-No!</i>

228
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,466
N-No!

229
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:14,000
Why? You're going to
die next spring anyway.

230
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:17,833
Then it shouldn't be a problem
if we do the seal now.

231
00:19:19,933 --> 00:19:21,200
N-No.

232
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,366
No!

233
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:30,233
No! Eichi!
Meroko! Takuto!

234
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:32,966
Let go of Mitsuki!

235
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,900
Let go of her!

236
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,066
Takuto!

237
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,633
Mitsuki, are you okay?!

238
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:42,133
Oh, it seems you've caught me.

239
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:47,100
You little... Don't be so rash!
We're in charge of her!

240
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:50,166
It's because you guys work slow.

241
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,466
What?!

242
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:55,500
After all, she's actually
getting better, isn't she?

243
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:58,100
Because of Eichi's email
or something.

244
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:02,066
Don't tell me...
Don't tell me that you...

245
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,100
Insightful, master detective Mero.

246
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
Mitsuki!

247
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,533
We were looking for you, Mitsuki!

248
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:15,300
Izumi!

249
00:20:16,266 --> 00:20:20,500
Well, I guess that's enough for today.
See you again soon.

250
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:22,133
Adios.

251
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:24,133
That Izumi...

252
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,366
Mitsuki! I have wonderful news!

253
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:33,366
W-What are you so flustered about?
And what are you doing here, Dr. Wakaoji?

254
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,500
A new method of treatment has
been discovered in America!

255
00:20:37,066 --> 00:20:40,133
With that method, we can operate
without harming your vocal cords.

256
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:41,200
What?!

257
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,833
You'll be able to keep singing
if the surgery is a success!

258
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,300
You can keep on living, Mitsuki!

259
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,033
Is that true?

260
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,366
Yes!

261
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,900
Isn't that great, Mitsuki?

262
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,066
Eichi's email,
this news about my throat...

263
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,000
I feel like so many
good things are happening

264
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:05,266
that something bad
is bound to happen.

265
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:07,133
Mitsuki?

266
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,433
But if something bad happens,
I'm ready for it.

267
00:21:10,866 --> 00:21:14,366
I feel like I'd have no problem
at all dealing with it!

268
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:18,400
That's the spirit, Mitsuki!
Get better and see Eichi!

269
00:21:20,466 --> 00:21:22,400
Oh no, what was I thinking?

270
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:24,400
Sorry.

271
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,266
She doesn't know that Eichi's email
was Izumi's doing.

272
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:36,400
What should we do, Takuto?
She's so happy.

273
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:38,933
How do we tell her the truth?

274
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,533
Hey, Takuto. I think we should tell her
that the email wasn't really from Eichi.

275
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:27,500
No! She's so happy!

276
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:30,900
Plus, she's in a contest for
the Best New Singer Award in America!

277
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:35,566
I know! But isn't it crueler
to make her happy with lies?

278
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,933
I know that too. But...

279
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:43,833
Next time on Full Moon:
"The Best New Singer Award."

280
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:45,633
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
