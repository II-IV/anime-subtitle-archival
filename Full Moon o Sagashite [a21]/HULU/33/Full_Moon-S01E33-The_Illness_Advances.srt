1
00:00:05,966 --> 00:00:10,100
Gosh! Why is Mitsuki so worried
about Madoka Wakamatsu?!

2
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:13,100
She says she can't let her be
and starts chasing after her,

3
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:15,166
and she even ends up
getting soaked!

4
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:20,066
Not only that, she encourages
the disheartened Madoka to sing again!

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,633
She's such a simple,
good-natured person.

6
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,900
So, I wonder what's
going to happen today...

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,666
Got that?

8
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:34,700
Yes.

9
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,166
Okay, we're going to
decide the groups.

10
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:17,266
Draw a lot from this box
one person at a time!

11
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:20,400
Mitsuki, I hope we're
in the same group.

12
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,266
Yeah!

13
00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:33,766
<i>Whoa, my heart's racing!</i>

14
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:36,900
I'm Group F.
What about you, Mitsuki?

15
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,333
Group F!

16
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:44,000
We're together!
All right, Mitsuki!

17
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,500
Over here, over here!

18
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,733
Group F is over here!

19
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:50,533
Emi's with us too?

20
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:51,533
Looks like it!

21
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:52,400
Oh...

22
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:54,300
What about Machida?

23
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:56,066
Well, actually...

24
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,933
Hey, Group B is over here!

25
00:02:59,033 --> 00:03:00,300
Oh! Me, me!

26
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:06,433
It's too bad that Machida
isn't in our group.

27
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:08,300
Yeah... I guess.

28
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:09,933
But we'll be on the bus—

29
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,166
Are you okay?!

30
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:13,033
Yeah.

31
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,900
It's nothing new.

32
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:16,266
I'm fine.

33
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:19,666
See?

34
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:31,666
<i>Thank you very much for coming</i>
<i>to the appreciation party</i>

35
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,133
<i>for the success of "Eternal Snow."</i>

36
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:38,366
<i>With everyone's help, we were able to</i>
<i>get into the top ten this time as well.</i>

37
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:42,933
<i>Now then, we will have a few words</i>
<i>of greeting from Full Moon.</i>

38
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:50,133
<i>Thank you for taking</i>
<i>the time to come here today!</i>

39
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:01,900
Oh, Dr. Wakaoji!

40
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:05,833
- Shall we go?
- Yes!

41
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:16,766
You're still going to eat?

42
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:17,600
Why?

43
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,033
No, it's nothing.

44
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,000
Why don't you eat too, Takuto?
You have to fill up in autumn!

45
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:27,966
Well, the recording was fun.

46
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:29,833
I hope we get to record together again.

47
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:30,833
Yeah.

48
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:33,300
Thank you for
the wonderful performance.

49
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,900
Next time we're going to have
a secret session in the studio.

50
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:39,266
You should come, Wakaoji.

51
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:40,100
Sure.

52
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:42,000
If you'd like,
why don't you join us?

53
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,200
What?! Is it okay?!
Yes, I'll go!

54
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:51,833
<i>Oh, I should tell Dr. Wakaoji about</i>
<i>what happened with my throat today.</i>

55
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:55,333
It'll be late at night,
so we can't invite Full Moon!

56
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:58,633
She'll be on her school trip anyways.

57
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,333
Umm...

58
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,366
Hmm? What is it?

59
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:02,833
Oh... Nothing.

60
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,466
Umm... Please look forward to
a souvenir from my school trip, okay?

61
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,366
You don't have to get me anything.

62
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:13,066
School trip, huh? How nice.
Right in the prime of youth!

63
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:15,900
What's with you?
You sound like an old man!

64
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,833
You don't have to say it like that!

65
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:25,100
<i>Oh well! It wouldn't be good to</i>
<i>make him worry over that little cough.</i>

66
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:31,833
I ate a lot! No more will fit!

67
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,233
Of course!
If you ate as much as you did...

68
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,300
I don't feel good.
Maybe I'll take some stomach medicine!

69
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,900
You shouldn't put anything else
in your stomach.

70
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:48,766
<i>I wasn't able to tell Dr. Wakaoji</i>
<i>about my throat,</i>

71
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,300
<i>but I don't want to</i>
<i>miss the school trip.</i>

72
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:55,266
<i>Well, I'll be fine.</i>
<i>This is par for the course.</i>

73
00:05:55,866 --> 00:05:57,100
What're you doing?

74
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,533
Hmm? Oh, it's information
about my school trip.

75
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,166
Oh...

76
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:05,066
What? Isn't this your new song?

77
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,533
Yeah! We're going to sing it on
the bus and the bullet train!

78
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,066
Hmm?

79
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:13,833
You can't have a school trip without...

80
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,100
Ghost stories!

81
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:17,233
Wrong, wrong!

82
00:06:17,366 --> 00:06:18,700
Then, being lectured by the teacher!

83
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:22,266
Wrong again!
You can't have a school trip without...

84
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:24,066
Wooden sword souvenirs?

85
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:28,633
Pillow fights!

86
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:30,133
Hey, now you've done it!

87
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,333
Eat this!

88
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,500
Be quiet—

89
00:06:34,366 --> 00:06:37,166
Jeez, don't bother me!

90
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,100
I said no!

91
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
Goodness...

92
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,566
What's she doing making
a ruckus by herself?

93
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:52,966
Her school trip is near,
so I'm sure Mitsuki is just very excited.

94
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,400
No more!

95
00:06:57,633 --> 00:07:01,666
WELCOME TO KYOTO!

96
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,666
MAP OF KYOTO'S TEMPLES

97
00:07:02,766 --> 00:07:03,766
How's it going?

98
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,766
Were you able to find places your group
wants to go on the school trip?

99
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,866
When you think of Kyoto,
you think of maiko, the apprentice geishas.

100
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:11,833
Where can you find maiko?

101
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,400
Mount Hiei? Kiyomizu Temple?

102
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,366
Really? Mitsuki, search!

103
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Okay!

104
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,866
Ma...i...ko...

105
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,333
LIFESTYLE AND CULTURE
PLACES TO EAT
PLACES TO STAY
Let me see... Shi...

106
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:26,833
Shien?

107
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,000
Shien?

108
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:30,600
You don't read it Shien. It's Gion!

109
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:31,533
Huh?!

110
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:33,733
You said Shien! How embarrassing!

111
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:34,766
Shut up!

112
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,066
Mitsuki!

113
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:42,233
Are you okay?

114
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,033
<i>I-It hurts.</i>

115
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,000
Mr. Yamane! Mitsuki is...

116
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:49,900
Mitsuki! Mitsuki!

117
00:08:05,566 --> 00:08:09,200
I see... She was really
looking forward to it, but...

118
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:13,700
We will pay careful attention,
so could you please let her...

119
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:14,800
No.

120
00:08:15,433 --> 00:08:19,333
If something should happen on the trip,
it would cause trouble.

121
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:23,100
So she will not be going
on the school trip.

122
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:30,800
What?!

123
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,100
It's in the interest
of your health!

124
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,200
And you must not cause
trouble for everyone.

125
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:40,233
But...

126
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:41,133
What?

127
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:43,900
There's only one school trip.

128
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:47,900
It's not just your problem.
Give it up!

129
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:55,366
I tried to tell Dr. Wakaoji, but he's off
today and tomorrow for something.

130
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,000
So I'll try consulting with him
early next week.

131
00:08:58,933 --> 00:08:59,600
Okay.

132
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:08,333
What?! No way!
We can't go on the school trip?

133
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,666
Man, I was really looking forward to it!

134
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,166
This isn't the time for that!

135
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:16,133
Huh?

136
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:23,033
You're right. The one who's
the most upset is Mitsuki, huh?

137
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:25,100
And she has to worry
about her throat too.

138
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:29,833
Remember Dr. Wakaoji's conditions
when he came on as producer.

139
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,566
<i>First, that you'll undergo</i>
<i>regular checkups for your throat.</i>

140
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:36,966
<i>And second,</i>
<i>when push comes to shove,</i>

141
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,700
<i>you will follow my instructions,</i>
<i>including undergoing surgery, okay?</i>

142
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,800
Th-That's bad!

143
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,500
Right?!

144
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:47,066
I'll have the checkup in her place!

145
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,033
That'd be totally obvious.

146
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:53,033
Th-Then how about
manipulating the X-rays?!

147
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,066
Even if you were to cover it up
with a quick fix...

148
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:06,566
This isn't the time for you
to be all downcast, right?

149
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:07,533
From now...

150
00:10:09,866 --> 00:10:11,533
W-What is it?!

151
00:10:11,933 --> 00:10:15,500
Calm down!
Put yourself in her position!

152
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:22,733
Then what do we do?! If she gets surgery,
she might not be able to sing anymore!

153
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:28,833
And things will get messy if she has
the surgery and ends up living longer.

154
00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:31,566
What should we do?!

155
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:49,266
Have a good trip!

156
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,033
Mitsuki, we'll be back with souvenirs!

157
00:10:52,466 --> 00:10:54,100
I'll send you a postcard too!

158
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,166
Okay! Take care!

159
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:02,400
Hey!

160
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,066
I'm okay!
I just choked on the fumes.

161
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,500
If you say so.

162
00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:26,800
Mitsuki is in Kyoto about now, huh?

163
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,833
I hope it doesn't rain.

164
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:32,300
Yeah. I hope she
creates nice memories.

165
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,266
Yes.

166
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,133
<i>We're going to sing on the bus,</i>
<i>there and back!</i>

167
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:12,533
How long has it been
since I fell in love with you?

168
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:22,066
My feelings keep
getting stronger.

169
00:12:22,633 --> 00:12:30,733
- They're silent like—
- ...like the snow.

170
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:32,366
Takuto!

171
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:36,600
Don't stop. I've gone to
the trouble of singing with you.

172
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:40,533
Okay!

173
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:49,533
- They're silent like the snow.
- ...silent like the snow.

174
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:59,166
- But they keep building up.
- But they keep building up.

175
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,900
- Hold me tight.
- Hold me tight.

176
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,066
- If loving someone...
- If loving someone...

177
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,933
- was going to feel like this...
- was going to feel like this...

178
00:13:07,766 --> 00:13:16,800
I wish I never
found out about love.

179
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,733
- I love you.
- I love you.

180
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,766
Mitsuki!

181
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Meroko! Water!

182
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,866
Right!

183
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,100
I-I'm okay. I can get it.

184
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:37,600
Mitsuki!

185
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,466
What does this mean?

186
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,866
In my opinion,
she should have surgery.

187
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,200
S-Surgery?!

188
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:21,800
Dr. Wakaoji didn't say anything about that.
Where is Dr. Wakaoji now?

189
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:24,033
He's off today.

190
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:25,233
Off?

191
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,833
Wakaoji is part-time now.

192
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:30,633
You hadn't heard?

193
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:32,533
No.

194
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,766
H-Hey.
This could turn into something bad!

195
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,833
Everyone was saying he would be the
next chief physician for sure.

196
00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:41,566
He has no ambition.

197
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:47,133
He said he wanted to play music again
like he used to long ago. And so...

198
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:52,433
Why?

199
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,133
Jeez! Don't say any more!

200
00:14:55,566 --> 00:14:56,566
Music?

201
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,166
Dr. Wakaoji...is playing music?

202
00:15:01,766 --> 00:15:04,233
Oh no. Now she knows!

203
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,833
You still haven't been
able to contact Wakaoji?

204
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,533
No... I get his voicemail
on his cell phone.

205
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,400
I see. Then it can't be helped.

206
00:15:23,033 --> 00:15:24,466
I have no other idea.

207
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:28,900
Dr. Wakaoji said that it could
be controlled with medicine.

208
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,733
What about that?

209
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,666
Oh? Let me see...

210
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:36,166
If nothing else, the progression
of the sickness will be curbed.

211
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:40,500
If nothing else?
Doctor, please operate!

212
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,166
N-No way!

213
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,600
N-No, that's something
for Wakaoji to decide.

214
00:15:45,866 --> 00:15:47,333
No, please do it!

215
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:53,266
Mitsuki?

216
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,366
Where am I?

217
00:15:57,066 --> 00:16:00,166
The hospital. You're okay now.

218
00:16:00,566 --> 00:16:01,233
Surgery?!

219
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:03,933
The old lady did something
she shouldn't have again!

220
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:05,033
I know!

221
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:08,066
She outright asked for the surgery!
What should we do?!

222
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:11,166
What should we do?!
That puts her voice in jeopardy too.

223
00:16:13,966 --> 00:16:16,800
Mitsuki, you mustn't in your condition!

224
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:19,133
Mitsuki!

225
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:23,500
Well, that was fun.

226
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,566
We haven't had a blast
like that in a while, eh?

227
00:16:25,966 --> 00:16:28,100
Ms. Oshige, let's do it again.

228
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:30,166
What? Really?!

229
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,100
What?!

230
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,200
Please arrange for
the surgery immediately!

231
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:42,100
W-Well, I must ask Wakaoji.

232
00:16:42,266 --> 00:16:45,233
It'll be fine if I sign
a letter of consent, right?

233
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,333
Hey, you...

234
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:50,533
Grandma!

235
00:16:50,566 --> 00:16:51,566
Mitsuki!

236
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,700
Umm... I'm okay now.

237
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:57,900
What's with you?!
Go back to your hospital room!

238
00:16:58,066 --> 00:16:59,366
B-But...

239
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,600
Relax, Mitsuki.
Just say you don't want to.

240
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,933
Say it! Say you don't
want to have surgery!

241
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,366
Jeez, this is irritating.

242
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,066
Meroko!

243
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:14,433
But...

244
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:16,300
Is it okay with you
if you lose your voice?

245
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:19,366
You get healthy if
you transform into Full Moon,

246
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,333
but if you lose your voice,
you lose it as Full Moon too!

247
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:23,100
What?

248
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,366
Umm...

249
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:37,900
Jeez! What's Wakaoji doing?!

250
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:43,466
Surgery?! When did it get that bad?

251
00:17:43,566 --> 00:17:44,566
I don't know!

252
00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:47,500
I didn't find anything unusual
at her last checkup!

253
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:50,266
Anyway, do the surgery
as quickly as possible!

254
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:53,200
As I've said many times,
I'm not authorized to.

255
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,333
That's enough.
I'll try asking another hospital.

256
00:17:58,133 --> 00:17:59,133
Ms. Koyama!

257
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,300
Sorry I'm late!

258
00:18:02,366 --> 00:18:03,566
Wakaoji...

259
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,100
Mitsuki!

260
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:06,666
When did you start coughing?

261
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,200
On the day of the party...

262
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,933
Why didn't you tell me then?!

263
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,633
I-I'm sorry!

264
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:14,133
Dr. Wakaoji!

265
00:18:15,066 --> 00:18:17,266
Thank you for taking the time
to come on your day off.

266
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,033
Sure. I apologize for how I look.

267
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:25,866
Why didn't you tell me that
you had become part-time?

268
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:30,166
I'm sorry. I judged that it
wasn't necessary to tell you.

269
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,500
And that you're playing music.

270
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:35,833
Well...

271
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:37,100
It's okay.

272
00:18:37,566 --> 00:18:40,400
She doesn't know that
he's Full Moon's producer.

273
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,533
I think mutual trust is
important for a doctor.

274
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:48,500
Grandma! It's not his fault!

275
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:49,600
I forced him to.

276
00:18:49,633 --> 00:18:51,233
Forced him to?! What?

277
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:53,733
M-Music...

278
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,000
Excuse me!

279
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,266
If it's that,
then I'm accountable!

280
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,733
Who are you?

281
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:02,800
Oh, Ms. Oshige is Wakaoji's fiancée.

282
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,466
Oh, no, you have it all wrong!

283
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,066
Then please be quiet!

284
00:19:07,566 --> 00:19:08,700
O-Okay.

285
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,833
Let's talk about that later.

286
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,033
Anyway, let me examine her!
Okay then, Mitsuki.

287
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,166
Yes.

288
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,066
Okay, we're done.

289
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,366
H-How is she, Wakaoji?

290
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:35,766
Yes... She's indeed getting worse.

291
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,500
I think surgery...

292
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,600
will be a last resort,

293
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:47,966
and it should be okay to treat you
with medicine for a while.

294
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:58,066
A different opinion
than this doctor, huh?

295
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,866
Who should we believe?

296
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,600
I'm the physician in charge.
Believe me.

297
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,766
Oh, I also think that would be best.

298
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:09,600
But, earlier you said...

299
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:12,866
Well, that was my individual opinion.

300
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:16,000
And Wakaoji's opinion
is not wrong, so...

301
00:20:16,566 --> 00:20:19,400
But we should ultimately
choose which.

302
00:20:30,366 --> 00:20:32,000
Please, Grandma.

303
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:37,700
If it's about the school trip or other things,
I'll do as you say. But...

304
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:43,000
Please at least let me decide
to whom I entrust my life.

305
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:55,233
Ma'am?!

306
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:00,533
Ma'am!

307
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,600
Ms. Koyama!

308
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:04,933
Grandma!

309
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,833
Do as you like.

310
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:18,733
Okay, here.

311
00:21:19,033 --> 00:21:22,733
It's stronger medicine than before,
but hang in there, okay?

312
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,300
O-Okay.

313
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,600
Has the matter somehow
been settled?

314
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:34,200
But we have to hurry before her condition
gets any worse and find Eichi.

315
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,900
Why?! Why?!

316
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,000
Huh? What happened?

317
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,100
No way! That can't be, right?

318
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:26,433
I said, what happened?

319
00:23:26,466 --> 00:23:28,666
No! I can't believe it!

320
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,966
I said, what happened?!

321
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:38,566
On her way to school, she ran into
an old man who can see us Death Spirits!

322
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,700
What?!

323
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:43,766
Next time on Full Moon:
"The Gentleman on the Swing."

324
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:45,533
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
