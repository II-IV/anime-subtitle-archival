1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,566
While preparing for
her school trip,

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,133
Mitsuki's illness takes a turn for the worse,
and she collapses!

3
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:13,266
She can't even go
on the trip anymore.

4
00:00:13,733 --> 00:00:17,900
What's worse, her grandmother
wants her to get surgery!

5
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:21,066
But Mitsuki firmly refuses,
saying she doesn't want to lose her voice.

6
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:24,566
Things are going to be tense between
Mitsuki and her grandmother again!

7
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,766
So, I wonder what's
going to happen today...

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,533
Got that?

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,666
Yes.

10
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,100
It feels so good!

11
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,200
Yeah. The sky sure is high.

12
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:18,400
It was worth coming out early.
Right, Mitsuki?

13
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,933
Hey, you can't keep being so glum.

14
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:25,600
That old lady is always unpleasant, right?

15
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,633
Yeah, but...

16
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:30,800
<i>Do as you like.</i>

17
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:36,000
She hasn't talked to me
much since then.

18
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:39,300
Even so, it won't do any good
to be depressed.

19
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:42,000
Right. Nothing gets done
when you mope around.

20
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:43,733
Yeah. But...

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,033
Jeez!

22
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:50,133
Everyone will only worry if you
go to school with a look like that.

23
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:54,633
How about we take a different route
as a change of pace?

24
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,033
Wow, that's amazing!

25
00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:06,066
How beautiful.

26
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,533
Yeah. I didn't know there was
such a lovely place nearby.

27
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,066
Oh, it's so romantic.

28
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,266
I'd like to come here with Takuto
sometime, just the two of us.

29
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:19,900
<i>Wait, Meroko!</i>

30
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,033
<i>Over here!</i>

31
00:03:30,966 --> 00:03:32,866
Mitsuki, it's about time to go.

32
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,533
Yeah.

33
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,466
Oh wait! Takuto!

34
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,766
<i>I wonder if he lives here.</i>

35
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:49,166
Mitsuki.

36
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:51,600
What're you doing? Let's go!

37
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:52,666
O-Okay.

38
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:09,300
Oh, that place used to be the mansion
of someone named Sanada.

39
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,533
Sanada?

40
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:14,133
Yes, I heard that he's the head
of a large company

41
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,566
and that he lived alone in the mansion.

42
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:19,633
But he may have moved.

43
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:20,300
What?

44
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,966
If I recall, it's vacant now.

45
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,700
With nobody to succeed him,
it was probably donated somewhere.

46
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:30,700
That's enough.

47
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:35,266
It's despicable gossiping
so much about others.

48
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,100
I-I'm sorry.

49
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,633
Okay, I've got to get to work.

50
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,733
Does it bother you that much?

51
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,700
He was just an ordinary gentleman.

52
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:50,800
Well, his fine graying hair
made him seem refined and nice.

53
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,566
Anyway, I'm gonna go again.

54
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:58,166
<i>After all...</i>

55
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:03,000
<i>I'm curious why he looked</i>
<i>so surprised when he saw me.</i>

56
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:28,500
That gentleman isn't here.

57
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,366
Yeah.

58
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:31,566
You guys!

59
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,466
Sure enough, you're the ones
from this morning.

60
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,266
Sure enough, the two in back
are with that girl.

61
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:40,800
- Huh? The two in back?!
- Huh? The two in back?!

62
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,533
W-Why?
Why can someone else see us?

63
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:49,233
He's the second person after her!

64
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,200
<i>There is someone other than me.</i>

65
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:54,300
<i>Someone who can see Death Spirits.</i>

66
00:05:57,766 --> 00:05:58,600
Mr. Sanada?

67
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,700
Then you lived in the mansion?

68
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,866
Yes. I wanted to be helpful
to people at the end at least,

69
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,566
so I donated all of the land.

70
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,233
And so I'm living here now.

71
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:11,800
Oh, sure enough,
it doesn't say anything.

72
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:14,666
How is it that you can see us?

73
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:20,200
It seems that Death Spirit
is cautious of me.

74
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:23,600
I'm sorry.
It seems Takuto is in a bad mood.

75
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:25,800
Meroko!
Don't say anything unnecessary!

76
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:28,500
Takuto and Meroko, huh?

77
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,233
Oh... Umm... I'm Mitsuki Koyama.

78
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,333
Mitsuki... That's a cute name.

79
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,800
Enough about that. Answer us!

80
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:42,800
Well, that's simple.
A Death Spirit appeared before me too.

81
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:47,333
I was told that I had one year to live.

82
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:52,666
I was shocked at first, but now it's
as if I'm just waiting for that day.

83
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:56,500
No way! What about your family?
They'll all be sad!

84
00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:58,200
I don't have any family.

85
00:06:58,266 --> 00:06:58,833
Huh?

86
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,833
They've all died.

87
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,966
I was successful in business and
had a wonderful family around me.

88
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,533
It was a happy life.

89
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,500
But I grew busier
with work day by day,

90
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:19,366
and I became unable to spend
enough time with my family.

91
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:28,200
One Sunday, I put work ahead of
a commitment with my son.

92
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,800
<i>Shall we even out this area?</i>

93
00:07:30,966 --> 00:07:31,700
<i>Okay.</i>

94
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,800
It was an accident that
happened in an instant.

95
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:52,033
From then on, I became
more absorbed in work.

96
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:56,000
It was painful to think
about my dead son.

97
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,566
My wife and I stopped talking and
we became complete strangers.

98
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:08,300
And then three years ago,
even my wife...

99
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,466
I was left alone.

100
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,633
Why didn't I value my family?

101
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:25,666
Why couldn't I share my feelings
with my wife?

102
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:28,300
I agonized with regrets of that.

103
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,300
It made it painful to even live.

104
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:39,100
It was at that time when the Death Spirit
appeared before me.

105
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,633
At first I was shocked.

106
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,100
To be honest, all I thought
was that I didn't want to die.

107
00:08:58,766 --> 00:09:03,600
But now, I'll finally be
able to see them again.

108
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,300
This time, I'll be able to
really listen to them.

109
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:12,000
Me too! I'm the same!

110
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,533
I have until next spring.

111
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,000
I knew it.

112
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,133
Aren't you guys ashamed to
take the life of such a little girl?!

113
00:09:24,366 --> 00:09:26,266
Oh... Well...

114
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,966
Umm... It's our job.

115
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:33,666
Mr. Sanada, Takuto and Meroko
are dear friends of mine.

116
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:34,833
Friends?

117
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:35,700
Yes.

118
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:39,766
And if they weren't with me, I...

119
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:44,233
Takuto, turn me into Full Moon!

120
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,066
Huh?

121
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,666
I want Mr. Sanada to understand that
you two are my dear friends.

122
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:51,400
So...okay?

123
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:53,900
Got it.

124
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,066
This is...

125
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,666
Takuto and Meroko made
my dream come true.

126
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:28,400
My dream to get the songs I love

127
00:10:28,433 --> 00:10:30,733
to resound within the heart
of the person I love.

128
00:10:30,966 --> 00:10:31,733
Songs...

129
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,633
Yes!

130
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,800
That is what's most
important to me now.

131
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:42,400
I see. I've seen you on TV before.

132
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:46,100
I see. So Takuto and Meroko
were helping you, huh?

133
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,166
Yes.

134
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,366
It seems you're kind Death Spirits.

135
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,166
Well, not really.

136
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,600
You're so mean, Takuto!

137
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,066
Why are you being so
disrespectful to your senior?

138
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,100
I'm not.

139
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,966
They're quite lively, aren't they?

140
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:03,866
Yes.

141
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,733
Mr. Sanada!

142
00:11:34,433 --> 00:11:35,566
Here you go.

143
00:11:36,866 --> 00:11:37,833
Thank you.

144
00:11:57,366 --> 00:12:00,766
Those two have totally
become friends.

145
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:05,366
I wonder if people who can see Death Spirits
have some kind of connection.

146
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,100
- At any rate,
- Was it a little scary?

147
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:10,233
- Mr. Sanada sure is cheerful, isn't he?
- No, it was a lot of fun!

148
00:12:10,266 --> 00:12:12,566
- Despite having only a short time to live.
- That's good.

149
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:16,600
But why can only those two see us?

150
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,566
Yeah.

151
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:19,533
It's a mystery.

152
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,833
What? These roses...

153
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:26,233
Mr. Sanada.
When are these roses going to bloom?

154
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:28,866
Oh, I think they'll be blooming soon.

155
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:32,300
My wife took great care of them
until she died.

156
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:37,166
She was really looking
forward to them blooming.

157
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:49,100
Hey, are you okay?

158
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:50,933
Is it that bitter?

159
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:52,733
No, I'm fine.

160
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:57,466
Say, Takuto. I have a favor to ask.

161
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,366
What is it?

162
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:02,700
I'd like you guys to wait just a little longer
before collecting Mr. Sanada's life.

163
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,033
I bet Mr. Sanada wants
to see those roses.

164
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:10,400
You know, he looked very
lonesome back there.

165
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:11,600
But you know, Mitsuki...

166
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:15,466
Please! At the very least,
until his wife's precious roses bloom.

167
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,200
There's no way!

168
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:18,433
That's impossible.

169
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,533
If I could do such a thing,
I'd have long since...

170
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,366
<i>I'd have long since</i>
<i>saved Mitsuki's life.</i>

171
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:28,066
But... But you know, Takuto...

172
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,066
Anyway, we can't do
what we can't do!

173
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:34,466
Takuto...

174
00:13:35,033 --> 00:13:38,666
You know, Mitsuki,
all we do is collect the soul

175
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,633
when the time limit of the life runs out.

176
00:13:40,766 --> 00:13:44,566
Determining the length...
is outside of our jurisdiction.

177
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:45,833
I see.

178
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:48,300
Yes.

179
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,566
I'm sorry.

180
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,566
You're not gonna go with her today?

181
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:09,000
You don't have to be so angry.

182
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,566
I can't help but be angry!

183
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:13,833
Oh Takuto! Jeez.

184
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,100
Wait! Takuto!

185
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,366
Hey! Takuto and Meroko!

186
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,366
Well, I'm glad I could see you guys.

187
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:36,000
As a matter of fact, I have something
I want to consult you guys about.

188
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:39,966
What is it?
We're on our way to Mitsuki.

189
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,933
Takuto!

190
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,900
Actually, I wanted to talk
to you about Mitsuki.

191
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:51,266
Would you be able to
give my life to her?

192
00:14:54,266 --> 00:14:57,400
It's unbearable to think that
she has such a fate.

193
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:02,100
There may not be much left,
but I want to give her my remaining life.

194
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:04,233
So can you guys...

195
00:15:04,266 --> 00:15:05,033
There's no way.

196
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,166
It's impossible for us.

197
00:15:08,766 --> 00:15:13,533
We can't... With our power,
we can't change fate.

198
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,066
I thought Mitsuki was an idiot,

199
00:15:21,266 --> 00:15:23,833
but Mr. Sanada's just
as much an idiot, huh?

200
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,600
We're the bigger idiots.

201
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:32,533
We have no power...
Other than collecting souls.

202
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,966
We can't do anything!
We're useless!

203
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:39,133
Damn it!

204
00:15:42,966 --> 00:15:44,933
Hello.

205
00:15:44,966 --> 00:15:46,166
Jonathan!

206
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,733
If he's here, then...

207
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,700
Of course, I'm here too.

208
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:51,600
Izumi?!

209
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,533
What're you doing here?!

210
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,600
Well, well.

211
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:58,233
There's only one reason for a Death Spirit
to come to the human world, right?

212
00:15:58,466 --> 00:15:59,266
What?!

213
00:15:59,966 --> 00:16:02,000
Work, work!

214
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:03,733
Jeez!

215
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:07,233
Let me see,
Yuichiro Sanada, age 56.

216
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:10,033
His life span goes until today.

217
00:16:10,866 --> 00:16:13,933
You guys are child specialists
from pediatrics, right? Why?

218
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:17,366
Beats me. It was the Division Chief
of Death Spirits' order.

219
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:20,200
Izumi, it's almost time.

220
00:16:20,633 --> 00:16:22,500
Right. Shall we get this over with?

221
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:24,600
Hey! Wait!

222
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:25,700
Takuto!

223
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:28,433
There's nothing we can do!

224
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,733
The code is to not interfere
with a collection!

225
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:36,300
Even so...
I can't forget about that old guy like this.

226
00:16:45,766 --> 00:16:48,333
The two of them didn't come today.

227
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:52,133
Takuto, Meroko.

228
00:16:57,033 --> 00:17:02,966
How long has it been since
I fell in love with you?

229
00:17:04,366 --> 00:17:10,233
My feelings keep getting...

230
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:17,633
I see. So you've come at last.

231
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:22,166
I've come to collect your soul by the order
of the Division Chief of Death Spirits.

232
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,600
- I'm Izumi.
- I'm Jonathan.

233
00:17:24,866 --> 00:17:27,966
Oh, different Death Spirits than
the ones who came before.

234
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:31,566
I guess I'll miss them.

235
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:34,233
It's time. Is it okay?

236
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,566
Yeah. Please start.

237
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,000
Are you ready?

238
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,766
Yes. I have no more regrets.

239
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,533
Izumi! Wait!

240
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,600
I've been waiting. I'll show you how
a Death Spirit should work.

241
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,000
No!

242
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,233
Mitsuki?!

243
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:14,466
Please, Izumi! Please wait a little longer
before doing your work!

244
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:19,266
Umm... This is some kind of mistake.

245
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,566
There's no way that Mitsuki
can see Death Spirits!

246
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,833
You see, umm...

247
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:27,400
Did you really think we hadn't noticed?

248
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:30,566
You guys were lovely,
getting all worked up.

249
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,400
You little...

250
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,766
Oops, I'm in the middle of my work,
right now. Don't interfere, okay?

251
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:37,333
No! Stop, Izumi!

252
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:41,666
At least... At the very least, please
wait until his wife's roses bloom.

253
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:43,400
It's okay, Mitsuki.

254
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:45,566
Mr. Sanada.

255
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,800
It's all right.

256
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:50,100
Please don't say that.
I don't want you to die!

257
00:18:50,366 --> 00:18:51,900
Listen to me.

258
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,066
Please live the rest
of your life to the fullest.

259
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,033
And live to the end without losing sight
of the things that are important to you.

260
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:06,166
Mr. Sanada.

261
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,600
Please don't look so tearful.

262
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:15,133
I'd like the last face I see on
this earth to be a smiling face.

263
00:19:18,466 --> 00:19:19,333
Okay!

264
00:19:22,466 --> 00:19:23,133
Huh?

265
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,300
What?

266
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,200
Okay, Mitsuki.

267
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,800
Please.

268
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,533
Gotcha.

269
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,000
Mission accomplished.

270
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:06,633
This will happen to you soon too.

271
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:11,466
At the hands of Takuto and Meroko.

272
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:13,900
Izumi! You piece of...

273
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:14,666
Takuto!

274
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,200
Whoa! You can't resort to violence, Takuto.

275
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:19,433
It's only the truth.

276
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,566
See you later.

277
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:30,900
Mr. Sanada...
Mr. Sanada.

278
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,500
Mr. Sanada!

279
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:43,500
Mr. Sanada...

280
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:53,366
Look, Mitsuki! They're blooming.

281
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,966
They're beautiful.

282
00:20:59,933 --> 00:21:02,766
These are the roses
his wife treasured.

283
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:15,366
I'm sorry, Mitsuki.
About Mr. Sanada, well...

284
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:19,366
Well... There was simply
nothing we could do.

285
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,666
Mr. Sanada might've seen
the instant those roses bloomed.

286
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:31,900
Takuto! I'll sing with all my heart.
Until the end! With all my heart!

287
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:33,400
So from here on,
I hope for your support, okay?

288
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:34,900
Takuto? Meroko?

289
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:35,800
Okay!

290
00:21:37,766 --> 00:21:38,933
Mitsuki!

291
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:22,500
Look, look, Takuto!
The romance! The drama!

292
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:27,900
Will you stop?! I already know!
She got an email from Eichi, right?

293
00:23:28,066 --> 00:23:29,833
Gosh, what's with the attitude?

294
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:32,933
This is the greatest thing
that could happen to her.

295
00:23:32,966 --> 00:23:34,866
You could be a little happier for her.

296
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:37,666
Okay, okay. Good for her.

297
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:39,700
Takuto's sulking now.

298
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:43,966
Next time on Full Moon:
"An E-mail from Eichi?"

299
00:23:44,366 --> 00:23:45,900
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
