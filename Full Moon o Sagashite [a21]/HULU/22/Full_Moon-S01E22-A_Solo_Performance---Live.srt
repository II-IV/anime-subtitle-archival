1
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:07,133
Mitsuki returned to work
for the first time

2
00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:08,866
since the cancelled
commercial audition.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,800
But Full Moon was everyone's topic
of gossip at the television station.

4
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:14,966
Furthermore, someone had cut her
costume to shreds

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,733
and she was in a big pinch
very early in her comeback!

6
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:20,200
But they overcame the problem
with Mitsuki's idea and

7
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:21,866
the TV recording finished
without a hitch.

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,533
This girl has gotten really tough!

9
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,766
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

10
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,566
Got that?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,666
Yes.

12
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:11,766
My first solo performance?

13
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,100
I thought it might be
a little soon, but...

14
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,800
There have been so many
requests from fans.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,366
So we decided to just pluck up
the courage and do it!

16
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,900
Are you serious?

17
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:24,766
It's like a dream.

18
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:29,466
You won't be saying cute things
like that for long.

19
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:31,700
Starting now you'll be very busy.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,766
Your summer vacation is completely lost,
so prepare for it.

21
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:35,500
I will!

22
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:39,266
And so as an experiment for
this first live show,

23
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,700
won't you take part in the planning?

24
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,200
What?! Me...take part?

25
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:43,866
Yes.

26
00:02:44,566 --> 00:02:46,100
We want you to put
your present feelings

27
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:47,866
into this as much as possible, Full Moon.

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,433
My present feelings?

29
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:54,400
Isn't there something?

30
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,533
An image or a keyword,
anything is fine, just say it.

31
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:02,133
Maybe I'm asking too much, after all.

32
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:03,700
No, I'll do it.

33
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:05,366
Please let me do it!

34
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:16,633
W-What's going on?!

35
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:26,766
Today I will explain the importance of
concepts for live shows.

36
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,300
Huh?

37
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,300
She's messed up.

38
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,066
Darn it!

39
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:33,166
I give up on these!

40
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,733
Anyway! For a good live show,

41
00:03:37,766 --> 00:03:40,933
something like an image,
or a theme is important!

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,033
Oh, about that, I...

43
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:43,766
After all, when you wrote lyrics,

44
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,933
you were so distressed,
it was difficult, right?

45
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,133
That's why Meroko will help this time.

46
00:03:49,366 --> 00:03:50,533
Like she said, that's...

47
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:52,900
It's like, Meroko is too thoughtful

48
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:56,133
and like, the number one candidate
for the wife of a Death Spirit!

49
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,966
This is no good.

50
00:03:58,233 --> 00:04:00,966
I know that everyone thinks so.

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,633
Um... Meroko?

52
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,200
Listen to what people say!

53
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:06,533
Mitsuki already knows that.

54
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:07,966
You know?

55
00:04:08,766 --> 00:04:11,166
Well, what do you intend to do?

56
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,700
It's Full Moon's first live show!

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,633
Yeah, the theme is the moon and stars.

58
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,166
The moon and stars?

59
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:20,000
Yes, I've decided that Full Moon's
live performance's theme

60
00:04:20,066 --> 00:04:21,900
is going to be the moon and stars.

61
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:23,033
You decided?!

62
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:27,366
Takuto! If you'd decided,
couldn't you have said something?!

63
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:31,066
I kept trying to say something
but you weren't listening, were you?

64
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:33,066
No way!

65
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,100
Meroko's disappointed.

66
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,966
Thank you, Meroko,
for worrying about me.

67
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,233
Actually, this live concert
will be distributed

68
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:49,066
throughout the world
through the internet.

69
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:51,533
<i>That's why, surely...</i>

70
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:59,433
<i>I realized you were always next to me.</i>

71
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:05,300
<i>Why do I like you so much?</i>

72
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:11,600
<i>Your voice echoes and
it sounds almost sad.</i>

73
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:17,466
<i>Up to now who was supporting me?</i>

74
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:20,266
<i>I realize, now that I'm far away.</i>

75
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:25,266
<i>What was supporting me?</i>

76
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:28,000
<i>The moon and stars.</i>

77
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,200
<i>I'll put all of my thoughts for Eichi
in the moon and stars</i>

78
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,000
<i>and sing with all my might.</i>

79
00:05:36,633 --> 00:05:38,233
Watch it, okay, Eichi?

80
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:42,400
I...I can't...I can't breathe!

81
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,800
We've decided on Bayside Hall
for Full Moon's first live performance!

82
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:52,966
We've confirmed that doors
will open at 5 and we start at 6, right?

83
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,233
Yes, furthermore we already
put the order in yesterday

84
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,166
for sets and lighting.

85
00:05:58,433 --> 00:05:59,766
How about musicians?

86
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,400
We've already gathered the best people!

87
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,600
We're right on the mark
for a background chorus.

88
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:07,333
Good. Have you assembled
the dancers?

89
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,266
Yes, we've gathered foreign dancers
with great experience.

90
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:12,200
Good.

91
00:06:12,566 --> 00:06:13,566
That's perfect.

92
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,033
They're really excited.

93
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:15,766
Yep!

94
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:21,466
<i>Everyone is working so hard
for my live show!</i>

95
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:24,833
The posters are hot off the presses.

96
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,166
- Hmm...
- Looks great!

97
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,833
Wow, it's beautiful!

98
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,533
Yes, it's well done.

99
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:35,433
Okay! This is finally the start
of Moon and Stars!

100
00:06:36,033 --> 00:06:36,866
Let's work hard!

101
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:37,800
Yes!

102
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,433
Moon and Stars...
It's the first live concert!

103
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:53,966
And so you're in the middle
of preparations?

104
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:57,133
Yes, I think it's going to be
a really good show.

105
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,566
Please come everyone.

106
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,200
- Yay!
- Go for it, Full Moon!

107
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:03,800
Yes, I'll work hard!

108
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,033
Yep, leave it to me.
I'll advertise it perfectly.

109
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:11,666
Thank you.

110
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,933
Actually, my children are
big fans of Full Moon.

111
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,400
I'll go see the show with my kids.

112
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:19,733
Do your best.

113
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:20,466
I will!

114
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:23,933
Here, take this.

115
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,133
I definitely want you to come, Mr. Akiba.

116
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,733
This is the best!

117
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:31,466
To be able to see your first live show
in seats this good...

118
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,433
As your fan, this is really exciting!

119
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:40,666
Put these posters all over
the inside of the store!

120
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:43,100
Okay, I've got it.

121
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:45,200
Big Sister Full Moon.

122
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:49,200
I'm cheering you on, so be
sure to make your concert cool!

123
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,166
I know, leave it to me.
I'm going to work my hardest!

124
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:54,166
Takuto, you cheer her on, too.

125
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:55,166
Yeah!

126
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:56,700
Promise!

127
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:58,100
Yep, I promise!

128
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:58,866
Yeah!

129
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:04,166
Thanks for everything today!

130
00:08:04,366 --> 00:08:05,933
Hey, do well at your live show.

131
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:07,166
I'm rooting for you.

132
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,166
I will.

133
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:13,866
Ms. Komaki...

134
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,066
Thank you very much!

135
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:25,933
<i>Oh, so it's her first
live performance, huh?</i>

136
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:39,933
Everyone, come to my first show, okay!

137
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,200
- Yay!
- Yay!

138
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:50,466
This will be the site of
your live concert.

139
00:09:01,866 --> 00:09:03,766
Wow, it's big!

140
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:07,966
This is a starter before you
go out on bigger and bigger stages.

141
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:10,633
If you're surprised by this much,
we're in trouble.

142
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,866
Um... Can I try standing on it?

143
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:15,533
Of course you can.

144
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,066
It's your stage.

145
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,566
I'm gonna do my best!

146
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:18,566
I-I'm home.

147
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:19,533
Hey!

148
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,133
You're late!

149
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,033
Sorry.

150
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,166
Whoa there.

151
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:30,133
She should at least change her clothes.

152
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,900
That's right, and you have
to care for your skin.

153
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,733
Hey you little brat! Wake up!

154
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,166
Yes!

155
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,100
My first live performance,

156
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,900
Moon and Stars,
please come and see it.

157
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,066
Wow, she's really groggy
with sleep.

158
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,900
Jeez. She's helpless.

159
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:04,566
Do your best.

160
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,033
Good night.

161
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:26,033
Come in.

162
00:11:27,566 --> 00:11:28,433
I wonder if it's done.

163
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:28,933
Yes!

164
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:35,133
How is it?

165
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:39,433
It's good,
but doesn't it lack impact?

166
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
You're right.

167
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,133
I feel like something's missing.

168
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,633
Shall we try making it showier
with accessories?

169
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:45,666
And...

170
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:46,700
- Huh?
- Huh?

171
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,200
Change her make up
so it's more colorful.

172
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,400
What? What? What?

173
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,466
How about like this?

174
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,766
Well...

175
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:15,100
Since it's come to this,
I'll take more of a risk!

176
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,466
Oh, I'm sorry! It will come off
in no time at all.

177
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:25,033
Let's see...
Where did I put it?

178
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,333
This is...

179
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:34,833
What are you doing, Mitsuki?

180
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,400
Full Moon?

181
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,700
Done!

182
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,700
It's the moon and stars!

183
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:47,200
Yep, it's cute!

184
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,200
Okay, with this as the starting point,
let's take a fresh look at the costume!

185
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:00,633
Lovely!

186
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:03,000
We put a bit of effort into it.

187
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,500
Thank you, Machi!

188
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:07,733
Since that's done,
next are accessories.

189
00:13:07,766 --> 00:13:10,366
Yes, that's right, the theme is...

190
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:12,766
- Moon and Stars!
- Moon and Stars!

191
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,633
Okay, let's work this thoroughly!

192
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,633
Yes!

193
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,333
Um... After that one is this!

194
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,600
Oh... I wonder if this one
is better than that.

195
00:13:41,566 --> 00:13:42,533
Don't sleep!

196
00:13:42,866 --> 00:13:44,433
But I'm so sleepy!

197
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:47,333
Meroko, weren't you ready
and willing to help?

198
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,133
The too thoughtful number one
candidate for a wife, right?!

199
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,133
<i>Eichi.</i>

200
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:08,100
<i>It's pretty, isn't it?</i>

201
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:08,833
<i>Yep.</i>

202
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:12,233
<i>I'm sure the time will come</i>

203
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:15,533
<i>when you'll sparkle just like the
moon and stars in the sky, Mitsuki.</i>

204
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,900
<i>I made a wish upon
the moon and stars.</i>

205
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:26,433
<i>That's why I named it
Moon and Stars, Eichi.</i>

206
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:29,733
<i>I want to sparkle.</i>

207
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:32,366
<i>For Eichi, so he can find me.</i>

208
00:14:32,866 --> 00:14:35,100
<i>so it will reach everyone
who supports me.</i>

209
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,733
It's done!

210
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:39,866
Is that all?

211
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,733
No.

212
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,466
Next I'll try doing it in this color.

213
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,666
At this rate, she intends to do it
until the break of dawn.

214
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,566
This will work.

215
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:57,366
I'll get this right over
to the accessory studio.

216
00:14:57,466 --> 00:14:57,933
Yes.

217
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,100
Th-There's a problem!

218
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:02,533
What happened?

219
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,200
The event site has been cancelled!

220
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:05,733
What?!

221
00:15:06,466 --> 00:15:09,200
What's going on here?!
The live performance is tomorrow!

222
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,833
They said that someone claiming
to be from Village Pro

223
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:17,133
called in to say that Full Moon's
concert has been cancelled!

224
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:17,900
No way!

225
00:15:18,066 --> 00:15:19,966
That's complete bull!

226
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:22,466
Explain the circumstances and
book it again!

227
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,500
However...

228
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:26,566
They said just after that
another event took the spot.

229
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,033
The posters, tickets, and
everything are done, you know?!

230
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:32,933
Anyway, everyone split up
and make phone calls!

231
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,200
Anywhere is fine,
just pin down something that's open.

232
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:35,933
- Yes!
- Yes!

233
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,133
Yes, it's tomorrow.

234
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:40,500
I understand, excuse me.

235
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:42,366
I see, then it's no good?

236
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:43,966
It's tomorrow.

237
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,233
I wonder if we can find
an event site or not.

238
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:49,566
Um... What's going to happen?

239
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,966
Yeah, if we don't find it...

240
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,000
All we can do is cancel
the live performance.

241
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,733
What?

242
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:00,700
<i>No way...</i>

243
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:03,233
I don't believe it!

244
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,233
<i>Serves you right.</i>

245
00:16:28,866 --> 00:16:30,433
Please do something for me.

246
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,300
I'm sorry, but...

247
00:16:32,433 --> 00:16:33,533
Please!

248
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:35,733
Could you please go home?

249
00:16:35,933 --> 00:16:37,800
The place is already taken. Sorry.

250
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:49,333
Please!

251
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,500
Email? I wonder who it's from.

252
00:17:21,466 --> 00:17:24,033
"I'm looking forward to Full Moon's
first live concert."

253
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,366
The high school girls I met that day!

254
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,400
But...

255
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:33,366
I'm sorry.

256
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,600
The live concert... Now I can't do it.

257
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:55,700
<i>It's too bad that it has to be cancelled!</i>

258
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,800
<i>It doesn't matter where you do it,</i>

259
00:17:57,933 --> 00:18:00,200
<i>I just want to hear your live singing voice.</i>

260
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:04,533
<i>It's "Moon and Stars."</i>

261
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:08,866
<i>How chic and cool would it be
if were under the real starry night's sky.</i>

262
00:18:09,366 --> 00:18:10,533
Moon and Stars...

263
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,100
Under the real starry night's sky.

264
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:30,933
Yes, that's it.
I can sing songs anywhere!

265
00:18:44,966 --> 00:18:45,800
Lighting over there.

266
00:18:45,966 --> 00:18:47,500
- Do it quickly.
- Yes!

267
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,133
If you don't hurry, we'll miss the
start time for the concert!

268
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:50,800
Right!

269
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,866
There's been a change in the
event site of Full Moon's live concert.

270
00:18:56,266 --> 00:18:57,633
It's over here.

271
00:19:03,566 --> 00:19:05,166
This is the event site?

272
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,533
Where's Full Moon?

273
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:15,900
Okay, please start.

274
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:16,733
Okay.

275
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,933
Okay everyone!
Thank you for waiting.

276
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,833
On the last night of summer vacation.

277
00:19:20,866 --> 00:19:23,066
Let's all make it exciting!

278
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:29,100
<i>Full Moon's first live concert,
Moon and Stars, starts now!</i>

279
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:35,866
Oh, Full Moon!

280
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,233
Wow, pretty!

281
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:29,833
Looks like the real moon and stars!

282
00:20:30,366 --> 00:20:32,600
Using your Death Spirit powers again.

283
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:39,666
Thank you! I'll do my best!

284
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,400
Well, I guess its okay.

285
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:48,733
Everyone, thank you for coming
to my live concert today.

286
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,166
Please enjoy yourselves to the end!

287
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:26,800
So romantic.

288
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:30,533
Yeah. The best so far.

289
00:21:32,766 --> 00:21:35,433
<i>Eichi, are you watching?</i>

290
00:21:37,066 --> 00:21:38,966
<i>Somewhere in the world!</i>

291
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:22,533
Hey Meroko. It looks like the manager is
moving into the neighborhood.

292
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,300
What?! Is that okay?

293
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,133
Why? She said it's to support her work.

294
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:34,000
But the fact that Mitsuki is Full Moon
is absolutely a secret from her family.

295
00:23:34,366 --> 00:23:38,266
See! Now she's been discovered by
Ms. Tanaka the helper!

296
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,100
Oh no.

297
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,066
Next time on Full Moon:
"Moving Panic"

298
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:45,566
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
