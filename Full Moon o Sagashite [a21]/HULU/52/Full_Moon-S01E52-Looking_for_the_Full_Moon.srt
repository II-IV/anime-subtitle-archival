1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:13,033
Who am I?

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,066
Your name is Takuto.

3
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:19,533
Why am I here?

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,233
You're here to create new memories.

5
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,166
I see.

6
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:32,500
This is the first time I've ever heard her,
but her singing is really good.

7
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:54,366
<i>Many things have happened in</i>
<i>this year since I made my debut.</i>

8
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,133
<i>I encountered many different people,</i>
<i>became friends with them,</i>

9
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,933
<i>and they've helped me</i>
<i>along the way.</i>

10
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:06,933
<i>This is a very valuable treasure.</i>

11
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,333
Full Moon!

12
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,166
<i>Madoka and I</i>
<i>went through a lot,</i>

13
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,900
<i>but now they're</i>
<i>just good memories.</i>

14
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:43,933
<i>No...</i>

15
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,133
<i>It may actually be that I was able to</i>
<i>persevere this far because of Madoka.</i>

16
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:53,800
<i>Ms. Oshige,</i>
<i>thank you very much.</i>

17
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,500
<i>Those are the only words</i>
<i>I can find to tell you.</i>

18
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,133
<i>Grandma, thank you for</i>
<i>coming to hear me sing.</i>

19
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:07,433
<i>I hope that you will start</i>
<i>to like my singing.</i>

20
00:04:37,866 --> 00:04:39,733
What's the matter, Takuto?
Are you in pain?

21
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,266
Wait!

22
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,200
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

23
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,833
<i>There's something</i>
<i>I'd like to say to everyone.</i>

24
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:04,300
Huh? Was that on the schedule?

25
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:08,233
<i>This year since my debut has</i>
<i>been a very important time for me.</i>

26
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:12,933
<i>It was a year in which a very naïve girl</i>
<i>experienced many things.</i>

27
00:05:13,966 --> 00:05:16,300
<i>To me, singing is life itself.</i>

28
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,933
<i>It is a very important thing.</i>

29
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:21,400
<i>Therefore, in order to protect</i>
<i>something so important,</i>

30
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:23,033
<i>please indulge my selfishness.</i>

31
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,866
<i>I'm going to be</i>
<i>taking some time off.</i>

32
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:31,266
- What?
- What?

33
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,666
Hey, hey, what's this about?

34
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,300
She hasn't told us anything
about that.

35
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,866
What do you mean?!

36
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:37,566
Are you trying to run away from me?

37
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Madoka.

38
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:42,666
<i>Today is the last day that</i>
<i>I will see you all.</i>

39
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:47,266
<i>I can't tell you the reason.</i>
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

40
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:53,033
It's life threatening?

41
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:55,100
Is that true, Ms. Oshige?

42
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,233
I can't believe it.

43
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,600
<i>But I will make you a promise!</i>

44
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,033
<i>I'll make a comeback someday,</i>

45
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:06,300
<i>so that I may meet you</i>
<i>all again one day!</i>

46
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,133
<i>I will!</i>

47
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:16,900
Madoka...

48
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:22,100
We'll be waiting for you, Full Moon!

49
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:23,166
It's a promise!

50
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,300
Hurry back!

51
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:29,100
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Thank you very much!</i>

52
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,766
<i>My sincere thanks to you all.</i>

53
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:38,300
<i>Let me sing one last song as</i>
<i>a present to you all.</i>

54
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,500
<i>And to one particular person.</i>

55
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:42,200
Takuto!

56
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,000
<i>This person is</i>
<i>so important to me.</i>

57
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:47,900
<i>If he had not been there,</i>
<i>I wouldn't be standing here singing.</i>

58
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,233
No, Takuto!
You can't disappear!

59
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:52,533
This is Mitsuki's last song!

60
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,533
<i>To that person, with heartfelt thanks...</i>
<i>"Love Chronicle."</i>

61
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:08,100
Don't! No, Takuto!

62
00:07:08,466 --> 00:07:10,133
Please don't disappear!

63
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:17,366
<i>- Why is it that I've forgotten</i>
- No! No!

64
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,900
<i>- how to fall in love?</i>
- No!

65
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:30,066
<i>Our meeting is the beginning</i>
<i>of our separation.</i>

66
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:36,366
<i>Somewhere along the line</i>
<i>I started to believe that way.</i>

67
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:45,066
<i>When the shoelace on</i>
<i>my dirty sneakers came loose,</i>

68
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,533
<i>you tied them for me.</i>

69
00:07:48,566 --> 00:07:55,466
<i>Seeing your bashful smile</i>
<i>under the morning sun,</i>

70
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,200
<i>my heart pounded instantly.</i>

71
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,866
<i>I don't love you just because</i>

72
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,866
- No matter what...I won't let Mitsuki die!
<i>- I want you to love me.</i>

73
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,033
<i>You gave me the courage</i>
<i>to honestly love you.</i>

74
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:15,400
<i>We will now—</i>

75
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,566
Meroko!

76
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,633
What are you doing, Mitsuki?!
Sing!

77
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,166
B-But...

78
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,200
Everything's fine over here,
so finish singing your song!

79
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,300
But...Meroko...

80
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,733
Please, Mitsuki.

81
00:08:32,866 --> 00:08:34,566
I want to hear you sing.

82
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:41,400
<i>You gave me the courage</i>
<i>to honestly love you.</i>

83
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:48,000
<i>We will now head towards</i>
<i>the dream for tomorrow.</i>

84
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:54,066
<i>No matter what happens,</i>
<i>I'll never look away.</i>

85
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:59,766
<i>I don't love you just because</i>
<i>I want you to love me.</i>

86
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:06,733
<i>You gave me the courage</i>
<i>to honestly love you.</i>

87
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,466
<i>We will now vow</i>
<i>to the coming journey.</i>

88
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:24,833
<i>No matter what happens,</i>
<i>I'll never let go off this hand, forever!</i>

89
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:26,533
Izumi?

90
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,466
That was just
a three-dimensional image.

91
00:09:29,233 --> 00:09:31,266
That was what Meroko wanted.

92
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,566
<i>And also...</i>

93
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,300
Don't worry, Mitsuki.

94
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,333
Just leave yourself in
the good hands of Dr. Wakaoji.

95
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:56,200
Okay.

96
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,066
Ms. Oshige, where are
Takuto and Meroko?

97
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:01,833
I don't know.

98
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:04,766
But they'll be all right.

99
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:08,666
I am certain that those two will keep watch
over you, Mitsuki,

100
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,900
no matter where they are.

101
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:11,666
Right?

102
00:10:11,933 --> 00:10:12,600
Yes.

103
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,333
IN SURGERY

104
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:36,600
Where's this?

105
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,366
Are you awake?

106
00:10:43,566 --> 00:10:44,566
Who are you?

107
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,033
I do not have a name.

108
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,900
People have always called me
by different names.

109
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:56,333
Takuto Kira. You regained your memory
from when you were alive

110
00:10:56,366 --> 00:10:58,533
and have therefore lost the right
to be a Death Spirit.

111
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,400
Normally, your fate would be
to become a ghost left to wander,

112
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:04,333
but because you have eaten
the Flower of Forgetfulness,

113
00:11:04,366 --> 00:11:06,400
even that is no longer possible.

114
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,133
What are you talking about?

115
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:11,766
You have forgotten even that,
haven't you?

116
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:15,433
I don't have the time to
indulge you by chatting.

117
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,866
I have things I need to do.

118
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:19,100
See you.

119
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,366
What is it that you must do?

120
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's...

121
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,933
Don't you remember?

122
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:34,366
I... What I want is to save
that girl's life.

123
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,866
Who do you mean by "that girl"?

124
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:38,566
That...

125
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,400
I can't remember.

126
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,133
Why can't I remember anything?!

127
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:00,600
Takuto!

128
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,166
Takuto!

129
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,166
Takuto Kira, Meroko Yui.

130
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:13,166
Not only did both of you try to
hinder the course of fate,

131
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,033
but you even laid your hands on
the forbidden Flower of Forgetfulness.

132
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:18,933
This is not something that
can be forgiven.

133
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:23,666
You will receive punishment
appropriate for your crimes.

134
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:27,266
And as for Mitsuki Koyama...

135
00:12:27,566 --> 00:12:30,566
- You're not going to take her life.
- No! Please...not that!

136
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:33,466
Her blood pressure has
suddenly started dropping.

137
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,400
<i>Three more minutes.</i>

138
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:37,966
<i>Please hang in there, Mitsuki.</i>

139
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,533
I don't care.
I don't care what happens to me.

140
00:12:40,866 --> 00:12:42,333
But please refrain from that!

141
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:45,266
What do you think gives you
the right to say something like that?

142
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,300
I don't know.

143
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,533
But I'm begging you, please don't
do what you're about to do!

144
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:53,933
There was a life I wanted to save.

145
00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:55,833
There was someone who
I wanted to save.

146
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,566
I don't remember anything,
but it remains inside here!

147
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,400
It remains inside here!

148
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,400
So please don't kill her!

149
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,266
Please don't take
the life of that girl!

150
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:08,800
I will do anything to stop you!

151
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:12,666
If you wish to do that,
you can no longer be a Death Spirit.

152
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:14,566
Nor can you become a ghost.

153
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:16,633
Is that all right with you?

154
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,566
Yes.

155
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:21,700
Takuto!

156
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:23,700
Takuto! Takuto!

157
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,433
Please save Takuto!

158
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,333
Please make me a ghost instead!

159
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,633
This man here cannot
even remember you.

160
00:13:31,066 --> 00:13:32,933
And you still say you wish
to take his place?

161
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,700
Takuto has taught me many things.

162
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,933
What it is to love someone...
and what to do when you love someone.

163
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:48,233
Even now, he is trying to save Mitsuki
even if it means giving up his own life.

164
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,800
That's why I would have
no regrets about taking Takuto's place.

165
00:14:05,966 --> 00:14:07,366
Doctor! She's stabilizing.

166
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:09,233
All right. Continue like this.

167
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,666
Her fate has already been changed.

168
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:14,533
Huh?

169
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,966
Meroko Yui. Stand up.

170
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,133
I release you from being a Death Spirit.

171
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,566
All right...

172
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:41,266
<i>Eichi!</i>

173
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:44,066
<i>Eichi!</i>

174
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,466
<i>Takuto! Meroko!</i>

175
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:57,566
<i>I'm always being helped by</i>
<i>the two of you, aren't I?</i>

176
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,066
<i>Takuto? Meroko?</i>

177
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:06,733
<i>Huh?</i>

178
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,133
<i>No! Don't go, you two!</i>

179
00:15:13,266 --> 00:15:14,933
<i>No! You can't go!</i>

180
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:21,133
<i>Meroko! Takuto!</i>

181
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,666
Mitsuki!

182
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,466
Mitsuki!

183
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:28,500
You're awake! What a relief.

184
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:32,733
Ms. Tanaka, please go get Dr. Wakaoji
and tell him that Mitsuki has woken up.

185
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:33,800
All right!

186
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,100
I'm so relieved.
You were asleep for one full day.

187
00:15:43,766 --> 00:15:44,766
Mitsuki?

188
00:15:45,033 --> 00:15:46,133
Does it hurt somewhere?

189
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,733
Mitsuki? Mitsuki?

190
00:16:03,033 --> 00:16:04,233
Ma'am?

191
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,966
Mitsuki has gone to the annex.

192
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,300
Again?

193
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,133
Just when Madoka says
she'll come to visit.

194
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,433
<i>The operation was a success,</i>
<i>so she should be able to speak now.</i>

195
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,266
It seems that the two of them
leaving has given her quite a shock.

196
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:24,666
<i>Even though Takuto and Meroko</i>
<i>are Death Spirits,</i>

197
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,033
<i>they put their lives on the line</i>
<i>to protect Mitsuki.</i>

198
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,800
<i>From now on,</i>
<i>we must protect Mitsuki.</i>

199
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:31,833
Yes.

200
00:16:32,266 --> 00:16:34,100
Are you on the phone
with Wakaoji again?

201
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:35,866
President!

202
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:38,433
It's great to get all fired up,
but exercise some moderation!

203
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:41,400
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll get right back to work!

204
00:16:50,433 --> 00:16:52,566
It looks like she can't see me.

205
00:16:52,733 --> 00:16:54,000
I told you.

206
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,900
I wonder why.

207
00:16:56,233 --> 00:17:00,533
Back then, she wanted to die if
she was going to be in such agony.

208
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,766
I think that's why
they were visible to her.

209
00:17:04,433 --> 00:17:07,200
I wonder where those two
are right about now.

210
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,333
I have no idea.

211
00:17:08,366 --> 00:17:10,266
But what is certain is that
we'll never see them again.

212
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:16,766
Are we going to be punished
in some way?

213
00:17:17,266 --> 00:17:21,166
Continuing to be Death Spirits...
That's our punishment.

214
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,000
That's right.

215
00:17:32,033 --> 00:17:33,233
I'm giving it to someone who's
just been released from the hospital.

216
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:35,533
I see. In that case
I'll give you a discount.

217
00:17:35,566 --> 00:17:37,400
Great! Thank you very much.

218
00:17:37,866 --> 00:17:39,333
See you later.

219
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,266
Oh my goodness...

220
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:44,866
What a cute mascot.

221
00:17:45,366 --> 00:17:47,100
He really likes it.

222
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,866
But he doesn't know why he has it.

223
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,066
It's because he hasn't regained
his memory

224
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,366
after a terrible motorcycle accident
two years ago.

225
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,666
<i>- Now then, it's been six weeks</i>
- Hey! Stop running off your mouth!

226
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,300
<i>- since Full Moon went on a break.</i>
- Sorry, sorry.

227
00:17:59,466 --> 00:18:02,500
<i>Everybody must be worried about her</i>
<i>since we haven't heard any news, right?</i>

228
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:05,133
<i>So we're doing</i>
<i>a Full Moon Special today!</i>

229
00:18:05,933 --> 00:18:08,266
<i>To start off,</i>
<i>I'd like to wish for her early return.</i>

230
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:13,000
<i>Just like the title, I would like her</i>
<i>to grasp a new future.</i>

231
00:18:13,466 --> 00:18:15,266
<i>Here is the new song,</i>
<i>"New Future."</i>

232
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:40,233
<i>Meroko Yui...</i>
<i>I release you from being a Death Spirit.</i>

233
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,266
<i>You can no longer exist</i>
<i>as a Death Spirit.</i>

234
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,366
<i>All right.</i>

235
00:18:46,033 --> 00:18:48,233
<i>Someone like you who has</i>
<i>been touched by true kindness...</i>

236
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,533
<i>You will become an angel.</i>

237
00:18:58,133 --> 00:18:59,566
<i>M-Me?</i>

238
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:03,700
<i>And you, Takuto Kira...</i>

239
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:07,166
<i>The feeling of loving someone</i>

240
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,933
<i>and wanting to protect and</i>
<i>save them is wonderful.</i>

241
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:14,133
<i>But there are few who can</i>
<i>truly act on those feelings.</i>

242
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:17,966
<i>You are one of those few,</i>

243
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,733
<i>moreover, that girl possessed</i>
<i>the will to avert her fate.</i>

244
00:19:22,966 --> 00:19:24,833
<i>What do you plan to do with Takuto?</i>

245
00:19:25,266 --> 00:19:28,166
<i>Takuto has not yet become</i>
<i>a real Death Spirit.</i>

246
00:19:28,866 --> 00:19:30,666
<i>I will grant you one more chance.</i>

247
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,466
<i>Huh?</i>

248
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,000
<i>Thank you very much!</i>

249
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:48,000
<i>However, Takuto will have to undergo</i>
<i>the same test again.</i>

250
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,633
<i>If the result is the same this time,</i>

251
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:54,100
<i>Takuto will immediately become</i>
<i>a ghost left to wander.</i>

252
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,500
<i>Takuto will do fine this time.</i>

253
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:01,933
<i>That's wonderful, isn't it, Takuto?</i>

254
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:07,100
Huh?

255
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:09,533
Why am I here?

256
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,766
Well, I guess it doesn't really matter.

257
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,300
Meroko!

258
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:33,633
Meroko!

259
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,566
My, what beautiful flowers.

260
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,266
I'm sure they will make
Mitsuki very happy.

261
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,366
I'm so glad.

262
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:48,233
Hey! Mitsuki!

263
00:20:51,566 --> 00:20:52,566
Meroko!

264
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,933
Oh, Mitsuki!

265
00:20:57,133 --> 00:20:59,066
I missed you!

266
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:10,033
Meroko! Meroko! Meroko!

267
00:21:49,566 --> 00:21:51,400
Takuto! Takuto!

268
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,100
Good luck!

269
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:09,100
Takuto!

270
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:21,233
Takuto...

271
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,566
This is goodbye, isn't it, Mitsuki?

272
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,566
Meroko!

273
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:35,833
Meroko!

274
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:41,866
Thank you!

275
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:44,300
Meroko!

276
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Meroko?

277
00:22:57,633 --> 00:22:58,633
Takuto...
