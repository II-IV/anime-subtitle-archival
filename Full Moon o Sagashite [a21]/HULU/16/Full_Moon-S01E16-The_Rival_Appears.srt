1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,300
This is Mitsuki Koyama,
a 12-year-old girl.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,966
She went to the beach and
met a wonderful boy there.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,500
Mitsuki got a boyfriend and
I went on a date with Takuto at the beach!

4
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:17,866
But that guy was actually
a serial womanizer!

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,433
His girlfriend found out about it and
Mitsuki was saved just in time.

6
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:24,466
The beach really is a dangerous place
during the summer.

7
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:27,700
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,466
Got that?

9
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:34,500
Yes.

10
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,300
Okay, we're done.

11
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:20,100
Thank you.

12
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:24,533
Is model work busy for you?

13
00:02:24,866 --> 00:02:25,533
Yes.

14
00:02:25,866 --> 00:02:27,466
But it's a lot of fun!

15
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:29,500
I see...

16
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,600
But don't be overdoing it
just because it's summer vacation.

17
00:02:32,866 --> 00:02:33,866
I won't!

18
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:37,000
What did Dr. Wakaoji say?

19
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,766
He said not to overdo it
just because it's summer vacation.

20
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:41,133
I see.

21
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,966
Like this?

22
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:11,500
Yes, great.
Looks pretty good.

23
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:16,066
But why did I get a shampoo job?

24
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:17,866
Would makeup have been better?

25
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:20,933
I-It's still too soon for makeup.

26
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,066
Your song is selling well
and you have some fans.

27
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,433
And you're wanted for commercials.
That's the next step.

28
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,333
Really? I wonder...

29
00:03:32,566 --> 00:03:34,966
Your face will appear like crazy
in magazines and on TV

30
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,533
if you're in commercials.

31
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,300
That's a little...embarrassing.

32
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,600
But I think it's a short cut
for Eichi to notice you.

33
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:53,600
<i>I see... Eichi...</i>

34
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,066
Okay! I'll do my best!

35
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,800
Right. That's the spirit.

36
00:03:58,266 --> 00:04:01,666
So, Miss Ooshige, when's the filming?

37
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:05,766
Oh, about that.
It hasn't been formally decided, yet.

38
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,566
There's an audition.
It's tomorrow.

39
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:09,966
Hm?

40
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,733
Please say that sooner!

41
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,733
I-I'm sorry!

42
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:20,300
Say, like this?

43
00:04:22,633 --> 00:04:24,166
Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

44
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,800
Aww, split ends.

45
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,566
Jeez, Meroko. You have to
be sure to take care of your hair.

46
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:34,300
Hair is vital for a girl.

47
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,633
I don't want to hear that from you.

48
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,433
Huh? What do you mean by that?

49
00:04:38,933 --> 00:04:41,000
Just kidding.
I just teased you a little.

50
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,833
Oh, jeez, Meroko.

51
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:48,400
Say, Takuto.
What do you think?

52
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:49,100
Huh?

53
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:51,233
Are you opposed to this girl
being in a commercial?

54
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:52,866
Huh? Really?

55
00:04:52,966 --> 00:04:54,133
N-Not particularly.

56
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:57,966
Oh, what's with the attitude?
How obnoxious.

57
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,933
Why do I have to be happy
about her commercial, too?

58
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:04,033
I'm going for a walk.

59
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:05,033
Oh.

60
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:06,466
Takuto...

61
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,100
Jeez, how unenthusiastic.
Usually, he's the first to be happy.

62
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:14,100
<i>Really... I wonder why.</i>

63
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,766
<i>Come to think of it, didn't he say</i>
<i>he used to be a musician?</i>

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,700
<i>I wonder if he means don't get carried</i>
<i>away over something other than singing.</i>

65
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:26,900
Right? You'd think that,
wouldn't you?

66
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:27,600
Huh?

67
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:30,433
Don't you think Takuto's
been acting strange lately?

68
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:34,000
He seems strange somehow
ever since the event the other day.

69
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:35,366
Event...

70
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,166
Oh.

71
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:43,066
<i>Don't, don't tell me...</i>

72
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:47,033
You don't know something
about it, do you?

73
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,433
Uh, no. Nothing at all.

74
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:57,000
I-I think I'll go to sleep now.

75
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,966
You're both acting strange.

76
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:04,666
<i>D-Don't tell me...</i>

77
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,233
<i>...you two are doing something</i>
<i>behind my back!</i>

78
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:17,000
What?! You're coming
with me to the audition?

79
00:06:17,366 --> 00:06:24,000
Takuto doesn't really seem into it.
And I want to go out once in a while.

80
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:26,133
B-But...

81
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,366
<i>Meroko concerns me.</i>

82
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,366
It should be fine every once in awhile.

83
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:44,800
Umm...

84
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:48,666
Yes! I'm happy! Okay Takuto, you
take care of things here, all right?

85
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:49,533
Uh-huh.

86
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:57,366
<i>I get a peculiarly suspicious feeling.</i>
<i>This time I won't let them be alone.</i>

87
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:12,433
La, la, la.
Going out, going out.

88
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,233
La, la, la.

89
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:17,466
- Going out, going out.
<i>- I wonder what's wrong with Takuto.</i>

90
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:19,900
<i>It should be fine every once in a while.</i>

91
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:23,933
I don't get it.

92
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:25,133
What's the matter?

93
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:27,133
N-Nothing.

94
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,966
Really?

95
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:29,333
<i>Really.</i>

96
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,266
<i>Anyway, I'll just think</i>
<i>about the audition now.</i>

97
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,200
Let me see, where is it?

98
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:43,133
What? You don't know
where the place is?

99
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:45,400
Then leave it to me!

100
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:50,233
Let's see, this way...

101
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,200
We passed through here, before.

102
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:54,000
Then how about this way?

103
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,100
It's the same place again...

104
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:57,233
Then, here!

105
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:00,133
That way!

106
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
This way!

107
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,000
We're totally lost, aren't we?

108
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:16,133
Maybe I'll have Miss Ooshige
come pick me up.

109
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:18,866
Are you lost?

110
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,866
What?

111
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:22,733
Y-You!

112
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:26,166
We met at the Seed Records
audition, right?

113
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:26,900
That's right.

114
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:30,266
Thank you for
talking to me then,

115
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:36,066
when I was so lonely not having
anyone I knew there.

116
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,466
Was that so?

117
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,133
Oh yeah,
congratulations on passing.

118
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,566
Thank you!

119
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:45,266
By the way,
where were you trying to go?

120
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,166
Oh, uh...

121
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Here.

122
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:56,833
Oh. It'll be fast if you take the train to
the next station and then walk from there.

123
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,600
Wait.
I'll draw a map for you.

124
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,400
Yay...

125
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,666
But you didn't say a thing about that.

126
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:06,733
Okay, it's here.

127
00:09:06,766 --> 00:09:07,766
Oh, okay.

128
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:08,700
Yay.

129
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:10,633
Thank you!

130
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:12,466
You're welcome.

131
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:14,300
All right, then! I'll be going.

132
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,100
- Good luck.
- Right!

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,166
Full Moon's easy game.

134
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:30,566
The audition will start if we don't hurry!

135
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:31,966
I know!

136
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,500
There she is!

137
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,333
Miss Ooshige!

138
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,166
You're late. What happened?

139
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,566
I'm sorry. I got lost.

140
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:46,133
I would've picked you up
if you'd called me.

141
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,900
Actually, there was someone along
the way who kindly told me the way.

142
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
From Shinbashi...

143
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:59,133
Shinbashi? You came from Shinbashi?
It said Yuurakucho, didn't it? See?

144
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,000
What?
No way!

145
00:10:03,566 --> 00:10:04,666
Why?

146
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:07,533
- That woman!
- Huh?

147
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,466
Oh?!

148
00:10:13,866 --> 00:10:16,400
It seems you've arrived safely.

149
00:10:16,466 --> 00:10:18,400
Th-That's mean!

150
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:23,033
I'm sorry.
I teased you a little.

151
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:23,733
Huh?

152
00:10:23,866 --> 00:10:29,466
I never thought you'd believe me.
Well, it's payback for before.

153
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:30,633
Payback?

154
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,333
Even though you said
you had no connections,

155
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,500
you actually did,
didn't you?

156
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:39,833
Without knowing that, I said such a thing
because I was convinced I'd pass.

157
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:43,900
No way...
I really didn't have any connections!

158
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:49,233
Is that so? I wonder if that's true.
If so, then let's leave things as they stand.

159
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:53,066
Let's fight fair and square
in the audition, okay?

160
00:10:57,066 --> 00:10:58,666
What's with that woman?

161
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:01,400
It's Real Music's Madoka Wakamatsu.

162
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:06,500
According to the information I got,
she's your biggest rival in this audition.

163
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,233
What? Really?

164
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,166
<i>You intend on continuing to</i>
<i>pretend not to know, eh.</i>

165
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,666
<i>I must have looked funny</i>
<i>in your eyes at the time.</i>

166
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:24,033
<i>But you watch, Full Moon.</i>

167
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,933
<i>I'll smash you to bits.</i>

168
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,700
Are there other rivals?

169
00:11:59,233 --> 00:11:59,900
Huh?

170
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:01,700
They're all rivals.

171
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,033
It's nothing but people I've seen
on TV and in magazines.

172
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,533
No way.
That's Madoka Wakamatsu?

173
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:11,200
I didn't notice until I was told.

174
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:15,400
Right? She had a plain image
when she was a child actor.

175
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:16,233
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

176
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:18,633
She's like a different person.

177
00:12:18,933 --> 00:12:21,000
Could it be that she had plastic surgery?

178
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:22,700
I don't know about that.

179
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:27,733
But I bet she worked really hard.
I could never do that.

180
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:32,733
<i>So Madoka was an actress</i>
<i>from when she was little.</i>

181
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:37,300
<i>She's an amazing person.</i>
<i>I wonder if I can win.</i>

182
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:39,233
- Hey, hey.
- Oh.

183
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,200
What're you getting nervous for?

184
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:41,900
Huh?

185
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,466
I guess it can't be helped.

186
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,533
I'll teach you what to look out for
so that you won't get stage fright.

187
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:50,966
Uh, okay...

188
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:55,500
Listen up. Be sure to reply carefully!

189
00:12:55,633 --> 00:12:56,300
Okay.

190
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,000
Anyway, relax.

191
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:58,766
Okay.

192
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,766
Keep your back straight.

193
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:01,766
Okay.

194
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,266
Answer promptly and clearly!

195
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:05,966
Okay.

196
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:09,266
When talking, be sure to look at
the person you're talking with in the eye.

197
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:10,200
Understood!

198
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,600
Very well. Then, let's go.

199
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:13,433
Okay.

200
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,166
What?

201
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,400
What's the matter?

202
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:20,633
The door won't open!

203
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:21,766
What?!

204
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,533
I wonder if it broke!

205
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,033
No!
Is anybody there?

206
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:36,733
I was sure that it was here.
Where the heck did that Mitsuki go off to?

207
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:38,933
Jeez!
The audition is going to start.

208
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,033
Ms. Oshige!

209
00:13:43,266 --> 00:13:45,500
Mitsuki!
Where were you?

210
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:48,333
I'm sorry.
The bathroom door wouldn't open.

211
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:50,600
Anyway, thank goodness
you made it in time.

212
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:55,266
This is the concept of the new product
that was handed out. Take a look at it.

213
00:13:55,566 --> 00:13:56,233
Okay.

214
00:13:56,866 --> 00:13:57,866
That woman.

215
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,466
I bet that woman did it.

216
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,900
Don't assume like that.

217
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:09,000
Also, the interview will be
in a group of two people.

218
00:14:09,566 --> 00:14:12,200
It seems the results will be determined
by the repartee with the judges.

219
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:14,633
And as for the person you'll be with...

220
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:23,300
It seems she's oddly concerned with you.
But don't let her get the best of you.

221
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,700
I won't. I'll do my best!

222
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:33,000
It's almost time.

223
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,033
What am I doing getting worried?!

224
00:14:38,933 --> 00:14:41,566
When the people ahead of you come out,
go in and take their place.

225
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:42,666
Okay.

226
00:14:47,766 --> 00:14:48,766
<i>The time has come.</i>

227
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:54,600
I think the bathroom thing earlier
was definitely that woman's fault.

228
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,100
That again?

229
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:57,533
You did well to get out.

230
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,166
See?! I told you!
I knew it was this woman's doing.

231
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:06,733
Do you have someone special
in your life?

232
00:15:06,766 --> 00:15:07,433
What?!

233
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,366
Relax! It's a strategy to try to
upset you before the interview.

234
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,266
Uh, uh-huh...

235
00:15:14,433 --> 00:15:16,166
What would happen
if I did have someone?

236
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:20,800
The thing that's hated the most among
commercial personalities is scandal.

237
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,833
The product image would be
damaged in one shot, right?

238
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,866
So in the case of a scandal being
exposed during the contract period,

239
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,766
as well as the commercial being pulled,

240
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,600
there are instances of the office having
to pay damages for breach of contract.

241
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,333
I-Is that so?

242
00:15:35,366 --> 00:15:37,733
What? Then what should you do?

243
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,100
<i>She's shaken up.</i>

244
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:47,333
I wonder if it'll be okay
with Meroko there.

245
00:15:52,966 --> 00:15:54,400
Well, I guess it makes no difference.

246
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,533
Of course I regularly use
Mermaid Tear shampoo.

247
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,733
I've been using it all along ever since
a person in a beauty parlor

248
00:16:03,766 --> 00:16:04,866
recommended it to me.

249
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,466
<i>I see. I came without knowing</i>
<i>anything about the product.</i>

250
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,400
<i>How should I answer</i>
<i>if I'm asked?</i>

251
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,000
<i>That pure feeling of yours</i>
<i>is good, Mitsuki.</i>

252
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,900
<i>So just come right out</i>
<i>and say what you think.</i>

253
00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:25,266
<i>Come right out and</i>
<i>say what I think, huh.</i>

254
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,566
Hey, hey.

255
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,966
Don't look so anxious.
I'll make it all go well.

256
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,366
Meroko, actually...

257
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,200
So, how about you, Miss Full Moon?

258
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,166
Huh?!

259
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,166
What's your image regarding shampoo?

260
00:16:37,466 --> 00:16:38,666
Oh, I...

261
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,333
Umm, I've been yearning
for dry hair since I was a kid.

262
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,366
Huh?

263
00:16:47,566 --> 00:16:49,200
Okay. Dry, eh!

264
00:16:51,366 --> 00:16:52,500
Fire.

265
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:57,133
That's too strong!

266
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,633
Meroko, turn it off!

267
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,166
I know.

268
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,966
Umm, I'm sorry.
This is nothing at all.

269
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,366
Uhh... Umm...

270
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:08,500
Jeez!

271
00:17:09,866 --> 00:17:11,800
Oh, I should've just turned it off.

272
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:13,700
Oh... Umm...

273
00:17:15,466 --> 00:17:17,800
Tadah. Is it dry?

274
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,633
You're funny.

275
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,200
Huh?
Yes...

276
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,233
<i>It's not funny at all.</i>

277
00:17:42,366 --> 00:17:43,033
Just kidding.

278
00:17:44,433 --> 00:17:47,633
<i>Something like that goes over well?</i>
<i>At this rate...</i>

279
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:50,566
Okay, this is it for the interview.

280
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Oh, okay.

281
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,633
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

282
00:17:55,866 --> 00:18:00,933
Oh, come to think of it, Full Moon.
Was it okay not to talk about that?

283
00:18:00,966 --> 00:18:01,633
Huh?

284
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:04,666
You have someone
special in your life, right?

285
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,566
Huh?

286
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,466
What's this woman doing
saying that at a time like this?!

287
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:12,200
Oh, I'm sorry. I went and said it.
Was that bad?

288
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:13,233
What? No.

289
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,900
What's the meaning of this?

290
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:16,066
Did you hear that?

291
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,366
Uh, well...

292
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:21,833
Say, "no!" Keep it a secret!

293
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:23,533
Keep it a secret.

294
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:32,433
<i>What?</i>

295
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,633
<i>But the moon is hidden</i>
<i>and I can't see it.</i>

296
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:37,100
<i>Even if you can't see it,</i>

297
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:39,566
<i>the coming and going of the tide</i>
<i>is because of the moon's power.</i>

298
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:44,266
<i>So on nights like this, close your eyes</i>
<i>and try listening to the sound of the waves.</i>

299
00:18:47,633 --> 00:18:50,933
<i>You can feel that there is a moon</i>
<i>in the sky even now, right?</i>

300
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:53,966
<i>Did you feel it?</i>

301
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,066
<i>Hmm...</i>
<i>But...</i>

302
00:18:56,266 --> 00:18:56,933
<i>What?</i>

303
00:18:57,466 --> 00:19:00,433
<i>Then I can't play hide and seek</i>
<i>with the moon.</i>

304
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:02,433
<i>That's right.</i>

305
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:11,166
<i>It's just for the promise with Eichi.</i>
<i>Why do I need to hide that?</i>

306
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,566
<i>If I were to hide it, it seems like</i>
<i>it'd be a bad thing. It's true, after all.</i>

307
00:19:16,733 --> 00:19:17,400
What's the matter?

308
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,766
Yes.

309
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,500
There is someone special in my life.

310
00:19:21,966 --> 00:19:23,166
Oh no.

311
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,000
<i>Now this kid's finished.</i>

312
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,366
What?
You went and said it?!

313
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,166
Yes.

314
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:40,533
Well, I guess it can't be helped.
That's the kind of girl you are.

315
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:44,633
I see.
It doesn't look good, huh.

316
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,900
Well, there's no need to be worried
about just failing one interview.

317
00:19:49,766 --> 00:19:50,933
Yeah... Bye.

318
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:53,666
I see...

319
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:55,900
Sure enough, it was no good
with Meroko there, huh.

320
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,966
Oh, Meroko.
Where were you?

321
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,800
I had a phone call from Takuto.

322
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,266
What did he say?

323
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,900
He said not to worry about it.

324
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:12,933
I see...

325
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,266
<i>But I didn't tell him that you talked</i>
<i>about Eichi during the interview.</i>

326
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,666
Good job today with
the interviews.

327
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,000
I will now announce
the results of the audition.

328
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,600
Umm, the results of the judging.

329
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,466
The image character
for Mermaid Tear is...

330
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,900
...Real Music's
Miss Madoka Wakamatsu!

331
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,233
Thank you.

332
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:49,866
We look forward to
working with you.

333
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,666
Thank you.

334
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,333
<i>I've paid you back for before.</i>

335
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,066
Oh, and there's more.

336
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,500
Village Pro's Miss Full Moon.

337
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:04,333
Yes?

338
00:21:04,366 --> 00:21:06,733
You're perfect for the image of
the commercial. So you, also.

339
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,200
M-Me?!

340
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:09,133
Yes.

341
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,466
You did it, Mitsuki!

342
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,800
Thank you!

343
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,466
That's all.

344
00:21:17,933 --> 00:21:22,700
We'll be changing this commercial's plan
and go ahead with a pair.

345
00:21:22,966 --> 00:21:24,466
W-What's up with that?!

346
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,900
Madoka.

347
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,266
I look forward to working with you.
Let's do our best together.

348
00:21:31,466 --> 00:21:32,133
Huh?!

349
00:21:34,866 --> 00:21:36,700
Please decide on
which one person!

350
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:37,500
What?

351
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,933
I don't want to work with her!

352
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:39,733
Huh?!

353
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,500
<i>W-Why?</i>

354
00:23:18,433 --> 00:23:19,600
Takuto, you idiot!

355
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:23,433
Why did you tell Mitsuki that you
were a singer when you were alive?

356
00:23:23,466 --> 00:23:25,233
Shut up!
This is my business!

357
00:23:25,266 --> 00:23:26,433
Your business?

358
00:23:26,466 --> 00:23:29,633
Takuto, do you know what
happens to Death Spirits

359
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:32,866
when they completely
remember their former life?

360
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,333
I already know that!

361
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,833
It's all right.
Just leave me alone!

362
00:23:36,966 --> 00:23:39,300
Wait, Tack!
Come back here!

363
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,666
Next time on Full Moon:
"Conflicting Personalities"

364
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:44,966
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
