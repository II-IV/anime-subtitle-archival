1
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:08,333
This is Mitsuki Koyama,
12 years old.

2
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:11,033
The thing we were
fearing most happened!

3
00:00:11,466 --> 00:00:14,033
A word appeared backwards in
the Death Spirit Handbook!!

4
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:18,000
That meant that her life was in
danger of being shortened!

5
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,266
This time, Takuto was there
to help,

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,433
so everything ended up okay,

7
00:00:21,466 --> 00:00:22,900
but what's going to
happen from now on?

8
00:00:22,966 --> 00:00:24,966
We're gonna have to keep
our eyes on her at all times!!

9
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:28,166
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

10
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:34,066
Got that?

11
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:35,100
Yes.

12
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:22,033
Hey, how long do
I have to do this?!

13
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:23,533
Uh! Don't move!

14
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:27,033
It's my homework I have
to submit the day after tomorrow.

15
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,100
All right, all right.

16
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:37,333
I'm gonna take a short break.

17
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:38,966
Me too!

18
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,300
Hey, let me see.

19
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:43,200
Okay.

20
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:45,500
What?!

21
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,033
What in the world is that?

22
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:48,933
It's you, Takuto.

23
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:50,600
Exactly what part of this
is supposed to resemble me!

24
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:51,466
See...

25
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,233
Huh?

26
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,466
The cat's ears.

27
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:55,266
Hey, come on...

28
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,033
Hey, Takuto...

29
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,700
Look at mine too.

30
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:01,866
You know...

31
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:05,666
I tried putting some twinkling stars
in your eyes.

32
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,033
Maybe I'll do that too.

33
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:09,866
S-Stop!

34
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,733
Maybe I'll draw flowers
around the edges.

35
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:13,966
Don't bring that thing to school!

36
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,266
Why?

37
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:17,133
You're really awful at drawing!

38
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,766
What do you mean awful?!
I put my heart into drawing this!

39
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,300
Even if you put your heart
into drawing it,

40
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,533
a bad drawing is a bad drawing!

41
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:26,233
I can't believe that's
the best picture you can draw

42
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:27,900
when I endured posing for so long.

43
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,400
I'll never model for you again!

44
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:32,266
Huh? But...it's for my homework!

45
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:32,933
Why should I care?!

46
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:34,633
Uh, wait, Takuto!

47
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,800
You really don't need to go
that far.

48
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:40,633
But...maybe it is a bad drawing?

49
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:05,000
Oh, my goodness!

50
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,000
What's the matter?

51
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,866
I'm so hungry, I can't move.

52
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:15,666
Goodness! Hungry...

53
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,333
<i>If he drops dead in
a place like this,</i>

54
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:22,200
<i>rumors will spread throughout
the neighborhood.</i>

55
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:25,966
A-All right.
In that case, please come in.

56
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,266
Sorry to trouble you.

57
00:04:40,566 --> 00:04:42,133
Sorry to keep you waiting.

58
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,866
Huh? Where did that old man go?

59
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:49,900
Huh? Uh? Uh?

60
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,000
This is terrible!

61
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:54,200
It would be bad enough
outside the house,

62
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:55,966
but if he dropped dead
inside the house,

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
rumors wouldn't end just
with the neighbors!

64
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:00,466
Are you all right?!

65
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:04,266
Ohhh...so sorry.

66
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,866
I suddenly got sleepy

67
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,933
as I was inspecting
the Feng Shui of the house.

68
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:16,266
Ohhh...
That looks marvelous.

69
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,833
What do you mean by
Feng Shui?

70
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,966
Is this how his shoes were?

71
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:39,433
Wait! Takuto!

72
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:43,100
Uh...Takuto, your shoelace!

73
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,866
It's untied!

74
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:50,200
Now that I think of it,
she hadn't drawn my shoes yet.

75
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,166
Thank you for everything.

76
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:55,433
You're very welcome.

77
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,300
Uh, I'd like to give you this
to thank you.

78
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:03,066
Huh? You're giving me something?

79
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,100
Huh?

80
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:07,766
Come, hold out your hands.

81
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:09,000
All right.

82
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:13,533
W-What is this anyway?

83
00:06:13,966 --> 00:06:15,666
It's a Saint's Stone.

84
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:17,800
If you're gonna give
me something

85
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,433
you ought to give me
something nicer.

86
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:21,800
Not some stupid "Saint's Stone."

87
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:23,566
Huh...did you say something?

88
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,333
N-Nothing at all.

89
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:29,300
That's good.

90
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:32,833
Well then, thank you again
for everything.

91
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:34,933
You're very welcome.

92
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,300
That burden is off my shoulders.

93
00:06:55,966 --> 00:06:57,033
Madame...

94
00:06:58,266 --> 00:07:00,066
Welcome home, Madame.

95
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:02,000
I have returned.

96
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:03,400
Oh?

97
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:05,266
What is that?

98
00:07:06,766 --> 00:07:08,400
Th-This is a Saint's Stone.

99
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:09,666
The old man said...

100
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,633
it's a miracle-working stone with
a long and distinguished history.

101
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,933
Throw it away now.

102
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:14,800
Yes, ma'am.

103
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:18,266
KEEP OUT DEATH SPIRITS

104
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,766
I wonder if she managed
to draw my shoes.

105
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:32,233
Hey, Takuto.

106
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:33,166
What is it?

107
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:35,066
What did you think about
my drawing?

108
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,933
Nothing in particular.

109
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:38,433
Don't you think I made
a good drawing?

110
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:40,333
How can I put this...

111
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,966
I was thinking of you, Takuto,

112
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,266
as I put my heart into
drawing this with love.

113
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:46,200
Put your heart into it?

114
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,600
<i>I put my heart into drawing it.</i>

115
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,600
Uh, well...

116
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:52,800
I do understand that you put
your heart into it but...

117
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,466
You do understand?!

118
00:07:54,866 --> 00:07:59,166
It was love, love, love,
love that moved my brush!

119
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,700
Huh?

120
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:02,133
I'm going back.

121
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,066
Uh, wait!

122
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,233
He didn't have to get mad...

123
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,800
And he didn't have to go
that far

124
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,500
in saying that it
was badly drawn!

125
00:08:30,866 --> 00:08:31,866
I wonder what that is?

126
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,800
Since the two of us
are finally alone,

127
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,500
let's go on a date.

128
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:40,266
Sorry but I'm going home.

129
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,200
KEEP OUT DEATH SPIRITS

130
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,666
W-What?

131
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:55,866
Takuto, did you do
something just now?

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,400
It wasn't me!

133
00:08:57,733 --> 00:09:00,533
In any case, one more time...
Here goes!

134
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,766
Takuto!

135
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:08,100
Takuto!

136
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,900
Owww!

137
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,466
What's the matter?

138
00:09:11,866 --> 00:09:14,466
I don't know.
But there's something here!

139
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,300
Yeah!

140
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,366
W-What's that?!

141
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,400
It's not in here...

142
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:34,333
If it isn't listed in the book...

143
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,700
In the case of unlisted problems...

144
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,566
Contact your manager directly.

145
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:44,400
Uh, is this the manager?

146
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:46,666
This is Green Onion Ramen...
who can quiet even crying children.

147
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,500
Please excuse my asking,
but is it possible that even though

148
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:52,000
we Death Spirits were previously
able to enter a place,

149
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:54,266
we're suddenly not able to
enter that place anymore?

150
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:56,333
Huh? It's possible.

151
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:58,900
Why is that?

152
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:00,833
Yes... Yes...

153
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,566
Huh?
A barrier has been established?

154
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,866
Huh? A barrier?

155
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,200
Did you find out the cause
of this barrier?

156
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:24,166
Yeah.

157
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,333
According to the Manager,

158
00:10:25,366 --> 00:10:29,333
something called a Saint's Stone
is creating this barrier.

159
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,900
Saint's Stone...

160
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,266
The identifier is...

161
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,966
The inscription,
"Keep Out Death Spirits"

162
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,900
which is carved on
the back of the stone!

163
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:37,633
And?

164
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,833
What did he say we
should do with that stone?

165
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,233
We should either smash it
or submerge it in water.

166
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:44,000
All right!

167
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,466
But, having said that,

168
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,966
we're not able to
enter the barrier.

169
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:49,333
Let's have her do it.

170
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:50,700
Good idea.

171
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:53,933
But I wonder who brought
the Saint's Stone here.

172
00:10:54,766 --> 00:10:55,833
Was it that old woman?

173
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:57,500
Maybe it was her.

174
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:01,300
Uh, there's no way she'd
do something like this!

175
00:11:01,866 --> 00:11:04,200
How do you know that?

176
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:07,900
I mean, she's the one

177
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,766
who would be in
a fix without us.

178
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,366
That's for sure.

179
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:13,266
Gimme a break!

180
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
In any case,
we've got to contact her.

181
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,966
Hello, this is Mitsuki.
Miss Oshige?

182
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:32,066
CALLER ID:
PUBLIC PHONE

183
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,100
Who could it be?

184
00:11:36,966 --> 00:11:39,266
Hello! Hello?!

185
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:40,966
It's me. Takuto.

186
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,300
And Meroko...

187
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,666
Stop fooling around!

188
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,466
I'm not fooling around!

189
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,033
Stop making prank phone calls!

190
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,200
I-Idiot! Don't hang up!

191
00:11:56,566 --> 00:11:57,433
She hung up.

192
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:01,266
But, what'd she mean
by "prank"?

193
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:04,866
I wonder if the barrier is
not only blocking us physically,

194
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,433
but our voices as well.

195
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:10,000
If our voices don't work,
I know our next move!

196
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:16,733
"Come outside the house.
Takuto"

197
00:12:16,966 --> 00:12:18,400
This should do it.

198
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:20,800
What do you mean this
should do it!

199
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,766
Huh?! Stop that, Meroko!

200
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,233
Come on, Takuto.

201
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:26,666
Do you know what
you're writing on?!

202
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,600
This?

203
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:28,866
That's right!

204
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,366
Aargh...my drawing...

205
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,433
This is an emergency situation.
Forgive me.

206
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,400
All right. Done.

207
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:38,866
Go!

208
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,133
I did it!

209
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:53,000
Goodness. Right when
a person's sweeping up.

210
00:12:54,366 --> 00:12:56,033
Go!

211
00:12:58,533 --> 00:13:00,233
Uh, it came back!

212
00:13:00,266 --> 00:13:01,500
Huh, why?

213
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:04,066
What happened?

214
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:06,033
Huh?!

215
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,366
What is it?

216
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,666
The writing's vanished!

217
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:10,033
- Really.
- Could it be that?

218
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:15,266
My drawing has vanished, too!

219
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,300
Hmm... Writing won't work either.

220
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,633
My Takuto is...

221
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:30,933
<i>Takuto and Meroko...</i>

222
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,766
<i>haven't returned.
I wonder if they're still mad.</i>

223
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:42,566
She's putting tea in
her miso soup,

224
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,166
and sauce on her pickles.

225
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,700
I wonder what's the matter.

226
00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:49,500
Gimme a break...
They're so stubborn!

227
00:13:49,766 --> 00:13:50,766
Huh?

228
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,666
Takuto and Meruko didn't
come back, after all.

229
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:09,600
Did I hurt them that much?

230
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:13,533
Let's call it quits.

231
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:16,633
She has school tomorrow,
so she'll come outside.

232
00:14:17,766 --> 00:14:19,266
Tomorrow's too late!

233
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,166
Why?

234
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,400
She has to...

235
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,466
Hello...

236
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,066
Who is...this?

237
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,266
<i>Have you forgotten
my voice, honey?</i>

238
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,700
I'm getting tired of this!

239
00:14:37,866 --> 00:14:40,266
<i>Uh... Wait...wait!
Don't hang up!</i>

240
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:41,166
Huh?

241
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:43,766
<i>It's me, me! Masami Oshige!</i>

242
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:45,566
<i>Miss Oshige!</i>

243
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,366
<i>What was the meaning
of that just now?</i>

244
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,233
I'm supposed to be the only person
who knows this number

245
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,433
but when you asked
"Who is this,"

246
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:55,433
I thought maybe you now
had a boyfriend or something.

247
00:14:55,566 --> 00:14:57,700
<i>Eichi is the only boy I love!</i>

248
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:01,100
Oh, that's right.
Then why?

249
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:03,733
<i>I received a prank phone call
yesterday.</i>

250
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:06,533
Huh, I see. That's worrisome.

251
00:15:06,566 --> 00:15:07,900
Should I change the number?

252
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:10,733
<i>No. Since there was
only one call like that.</i>

253
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:12,766
Are you really all right?

254
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:13,900
<i>Yes.</i>

255
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,766
Okay. By the way, please arrive
at the autograph session

256
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:20,166
in Ikebukuro thirty minutes
prior to start time.

257
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:21,366
All right.

258
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,600
<i>That's all I wanted to tell you.
Well, see you at the venue.</i>

259
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,466
Okay!

260
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:31,266
I need to leave at 12:00
or I won't get there in time.

261
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:36,800
What am I gonna do?

262
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:38,666
If Takuto and Meroko aren't here,

263
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,266
I can't transform myself
and leave.

264
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:47,600
Owwee!

265
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,566
Come on, let's call it quits!

266
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,800
How can we possibly call it quits
when we've come this far?!

267
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,233
Damn!

268
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:55,433
I could do something if
only she came outside.

269
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,966
Mitsuki!

270
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm gonna have that housekeeper
ask her to come outside.

271
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:07,033
In that case, leave it to me!

272
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:14,333
Excuse me...

273
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:16,766
Excuse me...

274
00:16:22,033 --> 00:16:23,300
What is it?

275
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,133
Wh-Who are you?!

276
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,233
Are you possibly from
the Koyama Family?

277
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,333
Y-Yes, I am.

278
00:16:33,533 --> 00:16:35,200
I'm so glad.

279
00:16:35,366 --> 00:16:36,366
To tell the truth,

280
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,666
I was the recipient of
extreme kindness

281
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,766
from the young lady of
the Koyama Family

282
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,766
and have paid a visit
to express my appreciation.

283
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,366
May I bother you to please
ask the young lady to come outside?

284
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,733
Uh, I will ask Madame.

285
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:53,900
Yikes.

286
00:16:53,933 --> 00:16:55,566
Thanks.

287
00:17:00,566 --> 00:17:02,333
See, it went well, didn't it?

288
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:03,866
In what way?

289
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,033
You were so creepy
that she fled!

290
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:08,233
I mean, what was that fireball
about anyway?

291
00:17:08,266 --> 00:17:09,733
It's a special effect.

292
00:17:10,266 --> 00:17:12,100
From the ghost story
"Peony Lantern"?

293
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:14,633
Bingo!

294
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,166
W-What are you doing?!

295
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,566
One can't leave things to you,
after all, Meroko.

296
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:25,066
I'll do something
no matter what.

297
00:17:27,366 --> 00:17:28,800
What am I gonna do?

298
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
If I cancel,

299
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:32,900
I'd feel awful about Oshige and
the people who are waiting.

300
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,833
Dr. Wakaoji sent a pizza?

301
00:17:38,866 --> 00:17:40,233
I wonder why?

302
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,900
What's this?

303
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,300
"To Mitsuki:

304
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,333
I cannot return to the house
because of the Saint's Stone."

305
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:52,433
"It's a stone which has
the inscription,

306
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:54,400
"Keep Out Death Spirits."

307
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,200
You don't need to
understand why!

308
00:17:57,233 --> 00:18:00,966
Just do as I say and deliver
the note together with the pizza!

309
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:03,766
"If you don't understand,
just go outside

310
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,200
and I'll do something about it.

311
00:18:05,566 --> 00:18:07,166
In any case, hurry."

312
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:11,600
They weren't able to come back
because of the barrier.

313
00:18:12,266 --> 00:18:15,366
Takuto! I'm sorry to
have doubted you.

314
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,833
All right...there's nobody there.

315
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:26,333
Mitsuki! Where are you going?

316
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,866
Uh, umm, I'm just taking
a little walk.

317
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,900
That won't do!

318
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,700
But, I'm feeling well today...

319
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,133
I ate pizza and
I'm brimming with energy.

320
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:36,466
I told you, no!

321
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,766
There was a very creepy and
obviously suspicious couple outside

322
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,666
who were asking
about you, Mitsuki.

323
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,700
It's my responsibility
if anything happens.

324
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,666
Therefore, stay inside
the house quietly today.

325
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,066
N-No way...

326
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:50,700
I wonder who she means by

327
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:53,100
creepy and obviously suspicious?

328
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:55,066
She's talking about us!

329
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,000
What am I gonna do?

330
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,166
I wonder if I have to call
Miss Oshige

331
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,100
and tell her I can't make it.

332
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:15,533
One of those stones must
be the Saint's Stone!

333
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:20,933
A stone with
"Keep Out Death Spirits"

334
00:19:20,966 --> 00:19:22,333
inscribed on the back.

335
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,366
Hurry! Hurry!

336
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,866
There's no time!

337
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,133
What are you doing, Mitsuki?!

338
00:19:34,366 --> 00:19:35,933
Uh, nothing...

339
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:39,566
Madame will scold you.

340
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:41,466
More importantly, Ms. Tanaka...

341
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,333
That stone from yesterday.

342
00:19:42,366 --> 00:19:43,366
Huh?

343
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,533
You moved a big stone
into the garden yesterday, didn't you?

344
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,733
We have been out of touch
for long time...

345
00:19:53,966 --> 00:19:55,600
Is something up with that stone?

346
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,566
I want to submerge that
stone in the pond.

347
00:19:59,033 --> 00:19:59,966
Why?

348
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:03,200
Why? Can't I?

349
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:05,433
I don't care what
you do with it,

350
00:20:05,466 --> 00:20:07,000
but keep it a secret
from Madame, all right?

351
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,300
Secret?

352
00:20:09,266 --> 00:20:10,766
I had one too many
pickling stones,

353
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,566
so I threw it away in the garden.

354
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,633
Huh? That stone was
a pickling stone?

355
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:20,400
I got a new stone yesterday.

356
00:20:21,266 --> 00:20:22,333
Is that what it was?

357
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,733
Huh, a new stone?!

358
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,500
I found it...

359
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:37,633
1...2...3!

360
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,900
<i>The ancient pond
A frog leaps in
The sound of the water</i>

361
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,966
The barrier is broken!

362
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:01,733
There's no time! Hurry!

363
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:05,600
Takuto! Meroko!

364
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:23,766
Hurry! Let's go!

365
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:24,733
Okay!

366
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,733
Do your best today!

367
00:21:29,866 --> 00:21:30,766
We did it.

368
00:21:30,866 --> 00:21:32,200
I'm sorry to have doubted you.

369
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:34,133
Huh, what are you
talking about?

370
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,500
And also, when you went to
all that trouble to model for me...

371
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,366
No, it's me who should apologize...

372
00:21:45,366 --> 00:21:48,200
Why do I have to do this?!

373
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:24,166
It's great that we get to come
to a mini-concert.

374
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,066
But why's it all the way
in the mountains?

375
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,000
Quit complaining!

376
00:23:27,033 --> 00:23:30,133
The Hiiragi-en concert has been a dream
for Mitsuki for a long time!

377
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,433
Oh really? She did say that
she grew up

378
00:23:32,466 --> 00:23:34,200
in the same circumstances
as those kids.

379
00:23:34,266 --> 00:23:35,833
Yeah, I hope it all goes well.

380
00:23:35,866 --> 00:23:36,966
Hold on, Takuto!

381
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,500
That kid's about to
take her outfit!

382
00:23:40,533 --> 00:23:41,700
What's the meaning of this?!

383
00:23:41,733 --> 00:23:43,666
The kids at this school
must have been looking forward

384
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,866
to this concert for a while!

385
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:48,566
Next time on Full Moon:
"A Little Concert."

386
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,633
- Don't miss it!
- Don't miss it!
