1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,633
Big news!

2
00:00:06,666 --> 00:00:09,966
Mitsuki's manager, Ms. Oshige, moved
into an apartment near Mitsuki's house!

3
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:13,266
As we were helping her out
with Dr. Wakaoji,

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,866
we were found out by
Tanaka the housekeeper.

5
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:19,900
But she mistakenly thought Ms. Oshige
was Dr. Wakaoji's fiancée,

6
00:00:19,933 --> 00:00:22,233
so she didn't think twice about
Mitsuki's relationship with her.

7
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:24,500
That was just perfect, wasn't it?

8
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:27,700
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

9
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:33,700
Got that?

10
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:34,700
Yes.

11
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:28,400
<i>You're really good at singing,
aren't you, Mitsuki?</i>

12
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,433
<i>What's that song?</i>

13
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:35,633
<i>It's a song my father
wrote for his work.</i>

14
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:36,700
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

15
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:40,033
<i>Yeah!
I'll teach it to you too, Eichi!</i>

16
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,033
The reason I asked everyone
to gather here today

17
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:10,066
is to brainstorm Full Moon's
next single.

18
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,766
That's right.

19
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,800
Thanks to everyone,
"Myself" was received well.

20
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,800
I would like to thank you for
your support this time as well.

21
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,866
Last time, everything was left
in Takasu's hands.

22
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:24,500
But this time, I thought I'd solicit
ideas from everyone.

23
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,533
I see.

24
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,866
In that case,
I'd like to do something new.

25
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,600
Something new?

26
00:03:30,966 --> 00:03:31,600
Hey!

27
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:33,000
Oh, yes?

28
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,966
Now then,
what are we gonna do?

29
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:38,266
I don't want Full Moon to be
just a one-hit wonder.

30
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:43,900
Okay then,
I'll leave the rest to you.

31
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,900
It sure is difficult to
do something totally new.

32
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:02,533
Don't...

33
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:03,233
Huh?

34
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:07,333
Don't you think we should ask
Full Moon for her opinion?

35
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:13,100
She sometimes comes up with ideas
that we wouldn't even guess.

36
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:17,266
And what is it that she wants
to express through the song?

37
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:22,000
I think it might give us
a key to hear her thoughts.

38
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,500
That makes sense.

39
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:27,500
Yeah... It would be meaningless
to continue this meeting.

40
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:28,666
That's true.

41
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,266
All right, I'll put all the information
together by the next meeting.

42
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:35,300
Huh? Me?!

43
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:40,300
Yes, it was decided that we would
incorporate your ideas too, Mitsuki.

44
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:43,533
I see. For some reason
that makes me excited!

45
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,533
It looks like it's finally Meroko's time
to come on the scene!

46
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,900
Leave everything to me!

47
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:52,733
Okay, without further delay...

48
00:04:56,433 --> 00:05:00,166
Well, that's par for the course.
And, how about it?

49
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,666
What do you mean, "how about it"?

50
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,366
I mean do you have an idea
or a motif or something?

51
00:05:08,366 --> 00:05:10,666
When you ask me that question,
I have no ideas.

52
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,500
You don't have to think
too seriously.

53
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:16,433
Let's think about it together
by the next meeting.

54
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:18,666
Huh? I have to attend too?

55
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:19,633
That's right!

56
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,066
That way the song will
bring you closer to Eichi, right?

57
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,500
Oh! I see.

58
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
That's true.

59
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:31,133
All everybody ever talks
about is Eichi.

60
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,266
Takuto...
How dare you!

61
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,166
- This ain't good!
- I'm not letting you get away!

62
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,833
Stop that, Meroko!

63
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:41,466
No way!
I won't forgive you!

64
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:45,000
- Oww!
- Take that!

65
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,166
Bring me closer to Eichi?

66
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,500
- That should teach you!
- Please stop!

67
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:54,600
Hmm... I wonder what should I do.

68
00:05:56,566 --> 00:05:59,100
You don't have to make it so
difficult for yourself, do you?

69
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,966
Come on! How irritating!

70
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,200
You're gonna get closer to Eichi, right?!

71
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:06,833
If it's gonna be like this,

72
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:10,700
why don't you go on and just
sing the name "Eichi, Eichi"?!

73
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:11,866
Gimme a break,
what's that about?!

74
00:06:12,266 --> 00:06:15,366
I mean, that's the fastest way
to make him take notice, right?!

75
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,633
Maybe so, but that kind of thing

76
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,233
- isn't very reasonable!
<i>- What should I do?</i>

77
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,300
<i>This is difficult.</i>

78
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,933
<i>A song that will bring me
closer to Eichi.</i>

79
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:16,966
<i>Eichi!</i>

80
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,666
Ms. Oshige, I've decided!

81
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,300
Oh, you've decided?

82
00:07:24,566 --> 00:07:26,833
And? What kind of image do
you have for the song?

83
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:28,833
No, it's not really an image.

84
00:07:28,966 --> 00:07:31,500
But there's a song that
I absolutely want to sing.

85
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:33,500
A song you want to sing?

86
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,000
Yes, but I don't know
the title of the song.

87
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:38,833
Huh?

88
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,200
Hey, you...

89
00:07:41,766 --> 00:07:45,233
Umm... As I remember,
this is kind of how it sounds.

90
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,833
- Huh?
- Huh?

91
00:08:04,366 --> 00:08:07,066
What was that song again?

92
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,200
Do you know it?

93
00:08:08,566 --> 00:08:09,233
Yeah...

94
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:11,933
But, Mitsuki, why this song?

95
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,633
This song holds a place in
my memories of the times with Eichi.

96
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:17,466
When I was little

97
00:08:17,566 --> 00:08:20,333
I often sang this song with Eichi.

98
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,766
So if I sang this song,

99
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,066
Eichi would know it too and
it might come to his attention.

100
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,466
That makes sense.

101
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,133
But what was that song anyway?

102
00:08:32,266 --> 00:08:36,266
Don't you have any other
memories of Eichi?

103
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:41,100
Umm... I guess just the song
that my father wrote.

104
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,000
Huh?!

105
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:43,533
That's an extremely minor clue.

106
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,166
There's no way we can figure
out the name of the song.

107
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:50,033
But I've definitely heard
it before.

108
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:54,866
Hmm... Your father wrote it when
you were little, right, Mitsuki?

109
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,066
Huh? Wrote it?!

110
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,366
Mitsuki, the person who wrote it...

111
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,533
Your father...
What did he do?

112
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:02,066
Huh?

113
00:09:02,466 --> 00:09:06,600
I don't really know because
he died when I was one,

114
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:08,533
but I understand he had a band.

115
00:09:08,566 --> 00:09:09,200
Huh?!

116
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:12,300
So your father was
a musician too, Mitsuki?

117
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:13,833
Didn't you know that?

118
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,033
Which means that

119
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,700
that's a band tune from
about ten years ago.

120
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:18,433
Yeah.

121
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:20,000
I got it!

122
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:20,766
- Huh?
- Huh?

123
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,433
"Eternal Snow"!
That's that legendary song by Route L!

124
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,200
"Eternal Snow"?

125
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:28,133
That's right!

126
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:31,866
It was only performed live
and was never recorded on CD.

127
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,033
A rare piece that was
only known to serious fans.

128
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:35,300
- Wow...
- Oh...

129
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:37,666
Huh? Which means...

130
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:43,033
M-Mitsuki's father was
a member of Route L?!

131
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:45,533
P-Probably...

132
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:47,533
Are you serious?!

133
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,033
S-Seriously...

134
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,833
Oh my gosh!

135
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,600
I can't believe this!

136
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:57,466
Oh my goodness, I can't take it!

137
00:09:58,066 --> 00:09:59,366
This isn't the time to
be saying this.

138
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:02,233
Okay, I guess we have
our plan in place then.

139
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:03,833
Now that we know that...

140
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,100
Let's go for it!

141
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:06,933
Hey!

142
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:08,200
Right, Mitsuki?!

143
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,233
Y-Yes...

144
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,100
I see.
"Eternal Snow," huh?

145
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:15,866
Yes!

146
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:20,166
Please. I want to sing
this song, no matter what!

147
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,400
What do you think?

148
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:23,900
I like it.
I'll go with that idea.

149
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,200
It's Route L's song, right?

150
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,666
- Yes!
- All right.

151
00:10:27,766 --> 00:10:29,900
Let's come up with a plan
without any further delay!

152
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:34,666
All right then, Full Moon and I
will go ask for Mr. Takasu's approval.

153
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,666
All right, let's begin.

154
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:37,666
Yes.

155
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,566
Well, I'm heading out!

156
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,666
Hello, this is Takahashi.

157
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,166
It's been a long time.
How are you?

158
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:55,333
How am I?
Not good at all!

159
00:10:55,366 --> 00:10:57,833
You're in your element as always,
aren't you, Mr. Takahashi.

160
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,566
I mean, nothing has happened
regarding your promise of

161
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,766
making up for the audition.

162
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:05,900
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

163
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:08,133
Please give me
a break on that, Madoka.

164
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,300
I'm up to my neck with
a new project.

165
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:16,666
Yeah...yeah...it's almost decided.

166
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:21,900
Yeah, I'm planning Full Moon's
second single.

167
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:23,166
<i>Full Moon?</i>

168
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,400
Oh, I see.

169
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,466
Yes.

170
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:29,666
Oh?

171
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,600
Producer Takasu's going to do
"Eternal Snow"?

172
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,266
Well, I'll treat you to dinner
sometime soon, Madoka.

173
00:11:36,966 --> 00:11:40,166
Yeah...Yeah...
Okay, talk to you soon.

174
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,166
Okay!

175
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,033
Madoka!

176
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:49,966
Did you wait long?

177
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:53,400
That last commercial was
well received.

178
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:54,533
Just now in the meeting...

179
00:11:54,766 --> 00:11:56,100
Ms. Sasaki!

180
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:56,733
Huh?

181
00:11:57,733 --> 00:12:02,566
You said that after this commercial
you'd let me sing, right?

182
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,166
Yes, what about it?

183
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,800
There's a song that
I absolutely want to sing.

184
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,366
Good morning!
Ms. Oshige?

185
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,600
All right! Done!

186
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:29,266
All right.

187
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,366
All we have to do now is take
this along and ask Mr. Takasu.

188
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,866
See, Mitsuki.
It's a perfect project plan.

189
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,300
Ms. Oshige, is it possible that-

190
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:41,066
Of course, I haven't slept.

191
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:43,133
Awesome!

192
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,700
A-Are you all right?

193
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:46,433
No sweat!

194
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:48,800
Come on, let's hurry over to Takasu's.

195
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:49,433
Okay.

196
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,600
This will bring you closer
to Eichi, right?!

197
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:53,066
Yeah...

198
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,566
You're bringing up Eichi
first thing in the morning?!

199
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,833
Rubbing it in, aren't you?!

200
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,366
It's morning!

201
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,566
- It's morning!
- Sh-She's running at high tension.

202
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:04,266
Is she really all right?

203
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:12,366
Mr. Takasu's late, isn't he?

204
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,166
He's apparently running a little late
because of some urgent business.

205
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:17,833
Can't be helped,
he's sought after by everyone.

206
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,500
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

207
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:22,600
Sorry, sorry.

208
00:13:22,866 --> 00:13:24,733
I suddenly had to attend
an urgent meeting.

209
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:31,666
And? I understand you brought along
a plan for the second single today.

210
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:32,366
Yes.

211
00:13:33,466 --> 00:13:35,400
I've summed it up here.

212
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:36,900
Let me take a look at it.

213
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,733
This won't do.

214
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,133
Sorry but this isn't
possible for me to do.

215
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:50,800
Huh?

216
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:52,000
Why is that?!

217
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,433
What's the problem with it?

218
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,133
Well... This is a pure coincidence,

219
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:59,566
but I'm already doing a project
exactly like this one.

220
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:02,866
The reason I was late today
was because of a meeting

221
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,166
regarding that project.

222
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,800
In the near future, a girl by
the name of Madoka Wakamatsu

223
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,433
will be making her debut
with the song "Eternal Snow."

224
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,233
<i>Eichi...</i>

225
00:14:18,866 --> 00:14:20,166
It's something that just sprung up,

226
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,833
so I'm sorry but the project
you proposed is impossible.

227
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:26,200
Please think of a different song
for your second single.

228
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,233
Gimme a break!

229
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,366
Ms. Wakamatsu, I understand that

230
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,633
you will be making your debut singing
a Route L song?

231
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:34,300
That's right!

232
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,533
I'm very happy because
it's a song I've always loved!

233
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,233
I understand that Mr. Takasu
will produce it.

234
00:14:40,466 --> 00:14:41,200
That's right!

235
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:47,133
I am thrilled that he will be
overseeing the entire project!

236
00:14:49,866 --> 00:14:52,566
I went to all that effort of staying up
all night to write this project plan.

237
00:14:52,633 --> 00:14:54,733
Is that kind of coincidence
really possible?

238
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:55,733
Coincidence?

239
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,433
No way!

240
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,266
There's something fishy about
that Madoka Wakamatsu!

241
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:05,066
But nobody knew about it
except us, right?!

242
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,600
O-Of course!

243
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,366
There must be a spy
around or something.

244
00:15:08,466 --> 00:15:09,266
Huh?

245
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,066
You're watching too much TV.

246
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:12,966
That's right.

247
00:15:13,033 --> 00:15:16,400
I mean, it's impossible for
the information to get outside.

248
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:19,433
Still, that girl is definitely fishy!

249
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:20,600
Hey...

250
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:21,833
- Ms. Oshige?
- Hmm?

251
00:15:23,033 --> 00:15:25,966
Will I ever be able to
sing "Eternal Snow"?

252
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:29,933
Mitsuki...

253
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:32,066
It'll be fine!

254
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,966
Don't worry.

255
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,466
I'll have you sing it,
no matter what!

256
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,500
Really?!

257
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,966
Yes! Let's go to
Seed Records again tomorrow

258
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,233
and ask a different producer
for his assistance, okay?

259
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,100
Now that it has come to this,

260
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:46,133
you and Madoka Wakamatsu can
battle it out with "Eternal Snow"!

261
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,833
- Wow...
- Wow...

262
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,566
See you next week.

263
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,600
Okay.

264
00:15:51,766 --> 00:15:52,333
Goodbye.

265
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:01,766
Mr. Takasu...

266
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:03,533
What is it?

267
00:16:04,066 --> 00:16:07,900
I'll do anything to make
"Eternal Snow" sell!

268
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,533
So...

269
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:09,700
What is it, all of a sudden?

270
00:16:10,966 --> 00:16:13,433
I don't want to lose...to Full Moon!

271
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,800
Full Moon, huh?

272
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,466
Hey... Are you hiding
something from me?

273
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:29,766
To tell the truth, I had exactly
the same project proposal

274
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,333
from Full Moon.

275
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:34,566
She wanted to sing "Eternal Snow"
as her second single.

276
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,300
Isn't that strange?

277
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:37,600
Oh...

278
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,033
Wow, that's an amazing coincidence!

279
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:40,600
Hey!

280
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,233
You're hiding something,
aren't you?

281
00:16:50,266 --> 00:16:54,233
Isn't this really
Full Moon's project plan?

282
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,866
And you knowingly asked me
to take on this project?

283
00:16:59,433 --> 00:17:00,900
In order to win against Full Moon.

284
00:17:01,433 --> 00:17:02,000
Am I wrong?

285
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:04,800
It pisses me off.

286
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,833
A newcomer suddenly gets
boosted up to the top of the ladder

287
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:12,433
and attention without
even having to work for it.

288
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:13,700
That pisses me off!

289
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,533
Well, whichever of you was first
really has nothing to do with me.

290
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:25,266
My job is to make a success of
the work that was designated to me.

291
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:26,933
However...

292
00:17:28,266 --> 00:17:32,633
I won't work with someone who
doesn't believe in my talent.

293
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,433
That's all I want to say.

294
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,200
Mr. Takasu, I have only one goal!

295
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,500
I don't want to lose to Full Moon!

296
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,400
Please let me win against
Full Moon.

297
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,633
That's good!
That's the spirit!

298
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,300
All right!

299
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:54,066
You truly want to win against
Full Moon, right?!

300
00:17:54,266 --> 00:17:54,800
Yes!

301
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,066
In that case, stop acting!

302
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,833
You need to do battle
as your real self.

303
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:00,766
Okay!

304
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:05,633
I will polish your talent thoroughly!

305
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,600
<i>I won't lose.</i>

306
00:18:13,033 --> 00:18:15,066
<i>I won't lose to Full Moon,
no matter what.</i>

307
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,933
This is perfect.

308
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,533
All we need to do now is
negotiate left and right.

309
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,933
Thank you very much, Ms. Oshige!

310
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,133
Come on. A manager and the artist
work together for a single purpose, right?

311
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:38,433
And moreover, Mitsuki,
the bandleader's daughter,

312
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,733
will sing that rare Route L classic!

313
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,366
That's only right!

314
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:47,500
Ms. Oshige, what kind of a person
was my father?

315
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:49,966
Well...

316
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,400
Of course, his guitar technique
was fabulous too,

317
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:56,133
but he was a man who could
really write wonderful songs.

318
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,100
He had great chemistry with
Dr. Wakaoji on the keyboards.

319
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:03,333
When the singer came in
on their music,

320
00:19:03,366 --> 00:19:05,833
it was totally out of this world.

321
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,033
Come to think of it,

322
00:19:07,266 --> 00:19:10,333
I wonder what the kid on
vocals is doing now?

323
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:14,966
Anyways, the kid was a great vocalist
who wouldn't lose to you, Mitsuki.

324
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,100
Goodness, why did they break up?

325
00:19:18,233 --> 00:19:19,933
If they were that famous,

326
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:22,633
there should be a video of
your father somewhere.

327
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,900
No, believe it or not,
there aren't any at all.

328
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:26,566
Huh? Why?

329
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,166
They were a band that
really hated appearing on TV.

330
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,166
"We'll battle it out on the
basis of our sound alone."

331
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,433
That was their policy and
I have to say that was really cool.

332
00:19:35,866 --> 00:19:39,900
That was one of the great attributes
of that legendary band.

333
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:42,366
Hmm... I see.

334
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,300
Route L, huh?

335
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:45,300
Hmm...

336
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,666
Gimme a break, all you've said
is "hmm" for a while now.

337
00:19:49,866 --> 00:19:50,800
Sorry to have kept you waiting!

338
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,300
Okay, let's go!

339
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,200
- Okay!
- Okay!

340
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,366
- Please!
- Please!

341
00:19:57,933 --> 00:20:02,000
Well, I understand how you feel,
but with the other fellow being Takasu...

342
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:03,433
Would you please ask someone else?

343
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:08,233
Wow... That sounds like
an interesting project!

344
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:10,066
In that case, will you take it on?

345
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:15,100
Hmm... I would if I had time,
but right now I'm just too busy.

346
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,766
Sorry!

347
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:19,266
I'm not gonna handle that.

348
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:21,433
Please, isn't there some
way you would?

349
00:20:21,766 --> 00:20:23,000
Even if you were to say that...

350
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:24,566
Then, is there someone who...

351
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,566
Whoever handles it would
just be crushed.

352
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,966
I'm saying this for your sake.
Just give up that project.

353
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:35,833
Other guys won't handle it either.

354
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:37,766
All right!

355
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,500
If things have come to this,
it's close to impossible but,

356
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:40,933
let's try overseas!

357
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,966
Huh? Can you speak English,
Ms. Oshige?

358
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:47,666
<i>Hello?</i>

359
00:20:47,866 --> 00:20:48,533
Hello.

360
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,466
<i>Takasu?! No!</i>

361
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,233
Isn't this nice, Takuto?

362
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,766
Oh, how did it go?

363
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,500
It didn't go well.

364
00:21:04,966 --> 00:21:07,633
When the other fellow
is Takasu, you know...

365
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,833
I see.

366
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:14,133
Goodness! I wish Mitsuki's father
were alive at a time like this.

367
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,900
I'd go right ahead and
ask him for help.

368
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:18,966
Oh! That's it!

369
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:19,966
Huh?

370
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:23,900
Hey, even if her father isn't here,
there's a father figure around!

371
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:24,966
Oh!

372
00:21:25,266 --> 00:21:26,733
A father figure?

373
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:29,566
You know, the guy who used to
play in the same band

374
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,733
that played this song.

375
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,500
- Oh!
- Oh!

376
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,400
- Oji of Route L!
- Oji of Route L!

377
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:40,766
I wonder if I'm catching a cold?

378
00:23:18,466 --> 00:23:21,133
How annoying!

379
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,666
What's the matter, Meroko?

380
00:23:22,866 --> 00:23:27,300
They decided to ask Dr. Wakaoji
to produce her new single,

381
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,300
but he won't agree to it.

382
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,900
Moreover, Mitsuki is uncomfortable

383
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:33,733
because she said it would
be imposing on him.

384
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:37,233
That doctor once said that he had
given up the path of music.

385
00:23:37,466 --> 00:23:39,166
That must have something to do
with his refusal.

386
00:23:40,033 --> 00:23:43,666
Next time on Full Moon:
"Please Dr. Wakaoji?"

387
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,100
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
