1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,533
This is Mitsuki Koyama,
12 years old.

2
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:10,866
She went to Hiiragi-en to
perform a mini-concert,

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,333
but she encountered
a mischevious boy.

4
00:00:13,633 --> 00:00:16,100
He was acting out because he was
going to be separated from the girl he liked

5
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:17,366
once the concert was over.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,600
Having similar experiences,
Full Moon sings them a heartfelt song.

7
00:00:21,766 --> 00:00:24,800
That song touched
my heart a little too.

8
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:28,166
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

9
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:33,966
Got that?

10
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes.

11
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,466
Ms. Oshige is late...

12
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,300
and Takuto and others
won't be around today either.

13
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,166
Sorry!

14
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,733
I was summoned by Director Shinigami
and there's no way I can go today.

15
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:34,766
If something happens,
call me with the whistle.

16
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:36,066
All right? All right?

17
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
What are you doing?
We're going, Takuto.

18
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:40,800
I-I know.

19
00:02:41,366 --> 00:02:42,500
So that's the story.
See you later.

20
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,033
Well, I guess nothing
can be done

21
00:02:51,066 --> 00:02:53,433
because Takuto and others seem
to have lots of things to do too.

22
00:02:53,866 --> 00:02:55,800
But still, where is Ms. Oshige?

23
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,566
Hello, is this Ms. Oshige?

24
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,200
Huh? What do you mean?

25
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,966
What?! You're in the hospital?!

26
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:16,533
Yeah, well...

27
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:23,200
That's why today, a replacement
manager named Akiba will go.

28
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:25,466
Oh...okay, I understand.

29
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:29,033
Yes, yes... Then please
take care of yourself.

30
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:33,366
It seems like it's going to
be a difficult day.

31
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:35,800
Oh yeah, Mr. Akiba who is
going to be the replacement...

32
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,566
Sorry to keep you waiting!

33
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,800
Full Moon!

34
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,000
Ah, you have the wrong person.

35
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,766
What?!

36
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,266
Excuse me...
Are you Mr. Akiba?

37
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:52,133
Yes, that's me?

38
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,766
Nice to meet you,
I am Full Moon.

39
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:57,700
P-Pardon me!

40
00:03:58,033 --> 00:04:01,100
I am Akiba Kotaro who will be
working with you today.

41
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,966
It was difficult finding you
because you were in disguise,

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,933
but I feel lucky that I was
somehow able to meet you!

43
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:08,300
Oh yes, I'm being told
by Ms. Oshige to be

44
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,733
"in disguise at places where
there are many people."

45
00:04:10,966 --> 00:04:12,566
That's Ms. Oshige as expected!

46
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,566
It would not be good if
you're noticed by the fans.

47
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:18,066
But today I, Akiba Kotaro,
will work hard to support you

48
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,100
and offer you management that
would not be inferior to Ms. Oshige,

49
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:23,666
so please leave
the matters to me.

50
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:25,366
Full Moon!

51
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,033
Hey, it's Full Moon.

52
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,133
It's true.

53
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,533
Wow, give me your autograph!

54
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:32,933
Darn! I've already made a mistake.
But it's okay.

55
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,866
Here!

56
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:40,000
Now's the chance.
Let's go!

57
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:46,166
It seems they've lost us.

58
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,766
Now then!

59
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,866
Let's go to our first assignment today,
an autograph session!

60
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:55,233
Yes. But where is
this place, actually?

61
00:04:57,966 --> 00:04:58,966
I don't know!

62
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,666
Ah... What do you mean
you don't know?

63
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:03,066
But it's okay!

64
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,133
We can figure it out with this.

65
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:09,733
Huh?!

66
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:13,166
I-I brought the wrong map.

67
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:17,366
Ah, you know.
Shouldn't we just ask somebody?

68
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:21,366
That's it! There was that move.
Let's immediately go find somebody!

69
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:23,900
Wha—? Mr. Akiba!

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,133
Here you go.
Please keep on supporting me!

71
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:40,733
Hello. Oh, it's City FM.

72
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,800
Yes, we'll be done here in
about 15 minutes, so it'll be fine.

73
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,133
Yes, we'll be on
our way there soon.

74
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,966
All right...take care.

75
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:53,133
Ah...Mr. Akiba...
I can't possibly do it in 15 minutes.

76
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,766
We'll be fine!
What's left is only 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,133
38, 39...40...41...42

78
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,900
387...389...390...

79
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,066
1421...1422...1423...

80
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,500
We're in trouble!

81
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,833
The number of fans in line
is more than I expected.

82
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:16,700
It'll take longer than an hour!

83
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,700
All right!

84
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,800
Please keep on supporting me.

85
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,633
Please keep on supporting me.

86
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:24,666
Please keep on supporting me.

87
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:25,533
How's this?

88
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,900
No...we won't be on time.

89
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:31,400
What?! I can't write
any faster than this.

90
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:33,666
Everybody!

91
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:37,933
The autographs after this will be
changed to handprints from Full Moon.

92
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,766
- What?
- What?

93
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,700
B-But that's not good.

94
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:42,733
The fans who took
the trouble to come here...

95
00:06:42,766 --> 00:06:45,266
Oh no! Is this really bad?

96
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,300
That's so cool.

97
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,800
I'm envious.

98
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:50,000
I wanted that one instead.

99
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:52,500
It's valuable and cuter
than a regular autograph.

100
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:56,800
Here.

101
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,966
Here... Here... Here... Here... Here...
Here... Here... Here... Here... Here...

102
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:06,533
Everybody, please keep on
supporting me.

103
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,566
- Of course!
- Of course!

104
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:13,066
We were somehow able to
make up for the lost time.

105
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,233
I'm glad everybody
was happy about it too.

106
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,833
Hey, hey.

107
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,433
Today's guest is Miss Full Moon,
but it's almost time to say good bye.

108
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,800
Now, can you tell us about
your ambition from this point on?

109
00:07:24,033 --> 00:07:28,566
Yes, I want to do even better on
the songs and release more CDs.

110
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,000
So it seems that you have plans for
live concert performances as well?

111
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:31,966
Yes.

112
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:34,033
Concerts?! Oh no!

113
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:37,000
I forgot to give her this!

114
00:07:37,266 --> 00:07:39,933
Yeah, I really do want to
directly meet the fans?!

115
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:45,466
Full Moon! Full Moon!

116
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,633
Mr. Akiba.

117
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:50,733
Hey, what are you thinking?
We're on air!

118
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:53,200
Oh, I apologize...then.

119
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:54,533
Hey you!

120
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,766
Full Moon, here's the schedule
for the concerts!

121
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,966
I'm so sorry!

122
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:11,500
Well...I make that kind of mistake
a lot too, so please don't mind.

123
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:12,833
Thank you very much!

124
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:14,966
I'll work hard not to make
a mistake next time.

125
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,666
What is next?

126
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:18,733
Yes. It's a mini concert
at a department store.

127
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,366
I'm so sorry, Full Moon.

128
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,166
Mr. Akiba, this is...

129
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,366
Special concert hall will
be from next week.

130
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,766
Hey, it's Miss Full Moon.

131
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,733
I sincerely apologize!

132
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,100
Well, the baby was cute,
so I don't mind.

133
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:49,566
I'm glad that you would
say it in that way.

134
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,166
Aren't you hungry?

135
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,633
The weather is nice,
so let's have lunch here.

136
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:57,766
Here?

137
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,800
I used to be an adventurer.
I once climbed Chomoranma too.

138
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,966
Huh, that's incredible.

139
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,866
Maybe it's ready now?

140
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,733
Wow, let's eat.

141
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,800
It's so good.

142
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:22,566
That's great. There is plenty,
so please eat a lot.

143
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,233
Yeah. But why did you
become a manager?

144
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:29,233
It's my dream!

145
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,766
When you're in an adventure,
you often face tough situations.

146
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:41,333
In those kinds of time,
music gives me great power.

147
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:47,366
It's my dream to foster a person who can
sing songs that can give courage like that.

148
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,100
Full Moon.

149
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:56,100
Isn't it Miss Full Moon's dream
to become a first-rate singer?

150
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:58,966
Dream...

151
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,466
That's not the only thing.

152
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:13,100
It's such nice weather.

153
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:16,300
That's true...feels great.

154
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:28,166
W-What's wrong, Mr. Akiba?

155
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:30,266
We're about to be late
for our next job.

156
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,166
Oh no! What is it next?!

157
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,233
A meeting with Mr. Takasu.

158
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Are we in trouble?!

159
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:39,000
This is bad! Really bad.
We have to go quickly.

160
00:10:40,566 --> 00:10:41,833
All right!
Only thing we can do is...

161
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,066
Let's dash, Full Moon!

162
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:50,233
Full Moon, turn to the right
at the next corner.

163
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:51,033
Yes!

164
00:10:55,266 --> 00:10:59,066
To reduce the time, we fly over
three white lines on the crosswalk!

165
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,133
Okay!

166
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,333
We fly over three tiles here too!

167
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,066
Let's go by flying
over five of them!

168
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,466
All right!
Great, Full Moon.

169
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,066
Let's keep on going this way!

170
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,766
Okay.

171
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,733
Now, we'll take a shortcut here!

172
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,566
Okay.

173
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,666
We fly over three steps here!

174
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,733
Okay!

175
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,566
We're almost there, Full Moon.

176
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,100
Okay! Here, we'll go.

177
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:21,200
- Last spurt!
- Last spurt!

178
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,100
Well, we tried our best.

179
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:40,166
I've run...this much...
for the first time in my life.

180
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,300
Mr. Takasu.

181
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,333
Late! You're tardy by an hour.

182
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:11,600
- We apologize.
- We apologize.

183
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:13,666
We are late,
it is my fault.

184
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,466
No, it was because of me too.
I'm sorry.

185
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,666
No, no!
It's my responsibility.

186
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,733
No, mine too!

187
00:12:18,766 --> 00:12:19,800
- No! Mine too!
- It doesn't matter whose it is!

188
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,533
We're going to hurry up
and do the meeting!

189
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,533
- Yes.
- Yes.

190
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:27,366
And...so, I think it's about time
to release the first album.

191
00:12:27,866 --> 00:12:29,800
Yay, an album.

192
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:32,966
I have about 30 demo songs,
but would you like to listen to them?

193
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,766
Yes.

194
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,700
What? Come on, come on.
Damn it.

195
00:12:38,766 --> 00:12:41,033
Something's wrong, I wonder why
the sound doesn't come out?

196
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,233
It has been in a bad shape lately.

197
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,033
Sorry, but it might not
be possible today.

198
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:48,000
What?! That's horrible.

199
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,433
No good.
Wait here for a moment.

200
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,800
I wonder if it'll be fixed.

201
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,566
I'd like to listen to...the songs.

202
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,833
All right, I'll fix it.

203
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,300
What? Ah, Mr. Akiba,
shouldn't we leave it alone?

204
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,100
Mr. Takasu will yell at us.

205
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It'll be fine.
I'm good at video games.

206
00:13:25,266 --> 00:13:28,233
Mr. Akiba, I think it's different
from a video game.

207
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,466
What?
Something's wrong.

208
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:32,766
What the?

209
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,600
Hey, what are you doing?!

210
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,600
Ah, well...I mean.

211
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,466
All of the data for
the songs are erased.

212
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,633
- What?!
- What?!

213
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:51,500
What have you done?!

214
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
That was the data
for the first album.

215
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:55,600
I-I'm so sorry!

216
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:58,733
Sorry, Mr. Takasu.
Mr. Akiba did not do it on purpose!

217
00:13:58,766 --> 00:14:00,600
How can he do
such a thing on purpose!

218
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:04,800
First of all, how can an incompetent guy
like you work as a manager!

219
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:07,366
If a piece of garbage like you is around,
it brings trouble to everybody else,

220
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,266
so isn't it best to quit
as soon as possible?

221
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:11,200
Hurry up and leave,
you good for nothing!

222
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,833
Like Mr. Takasu said,
I might not be suited...as a manager.

223
00:14:23,233 --> 00:14:24,766
That's not true at all.

224
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:25,800
No.

225
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,800
In fact, that is the case.

226
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:29,533
What?

227
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,600
I'm always like this.

228
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:35,966
When I'm entrusted with
somebody's management,

229
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,200
I jump the gun...and in the end,
it's mostly blunders.

230
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,700
This time,

231
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:45,900
I was determined to get a fresh start
in working with Miss Full Moon,

232
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:48,600
but it ends up being like this.

233
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:52,366
It might be time to quit.

234
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,333
What are you saying?!

235
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:58,800
Mr. Akiba, you're working
with all of your effort!

236
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:00,533
Even just now,

237
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,633
you did that because I was saying
how I wanted to listen to the songs.

238
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,766
In addition, I had many new experiences
today by being with Mr. Akiba.

239
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,066
What?

240
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,366
I haven't had that many opportunities
to play outside until now.

241
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,666
But today,
it was really fun because

242
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,933
I ate a meal like at a camp and
ran more than I've ever had.

243
00:15:23,866 --> 00:15:24,933
Full Moon...

244
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:28,066
So stop saying that kind of stuff
and why don't we try our best?

245
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,966
Okay? Mr. Akiba...

246
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,166
Thank you very much.

247
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,000
Huh?! What is that?

248
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,366
No matter what you say,
that replacement manager is too clumsy!

249
00:15:41,766 --> 00:15:43,400
He's like Ms. So-and-so.

250
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:44,733
W-What do you mean?!

251
00:15:44,766 --> 00:15:47,833
I'm also trying my best in
doing this Shinigami work.

252
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:51,033
That person probably also fails
despite doing his best.

253
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,866
Yes!
I understand, I understand.

254
00:15:58,866 --> 00:15:59,866
Hello...

255
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,500
Oh! Mr. Akiba?

256
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:04,566
Thank you very much.

257
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,766
Sorry about all those
things yesterday.

258
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,266
Ah...I thought a lot about it...

259
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,333
but I've decided to quit my job
and go home to the countryside.

260
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:17,000
What are you saying?!
Please don't say that you're quitting.

261
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:19,833
We can both go and
apologize to Mr. Takasu.

262
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,966
No...like Mr. Takasu was saying,
I should quit being a manager.

263
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,366
I just bring trouble to everybody
if I am around.

264
00:16:29,766 --> 00:16:32,900
If I don't head towards the station,
I'll be late for the bullet train.

265
00:16:33,566 --> 00:16:36,333
Full Moon,
thank you for everything.

266
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,866
Hey! Mr. Akiba?

267
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,866
Mr. Akiba!
Hello, hello, Mr. Akiba!

268
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,900
What's wrong?

269
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,233
Mr. Akiba is going to quit!

270
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:49,033
If I don't get to the station soon,

271
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,533
I'm going to be late for the bullet train,
and Mr. Takasu is going to be angry.

272
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,933
Oh, what should I do?

273
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,466
Takuto!

274
00:16:55,066 --> 00:16:57,433
All right! I got it, so calm down!

275
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
<i>Mr. Akiba...</i>

276
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,933
<i>I have to hurry.
Oh yeah, in this kind of situation...</i>

277
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:21,700
<i>To reduce the time, we fly over
three white lines on the crosswalk!</i>

278
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:22,400
<i>Okay!</i>

279
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:24,100
<i>We fly over three tiles here too!</i>

280
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,500
<i>Now, we'll take a shortcut here!</i>

281
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,366
<i>We fly over three steps here!</i>

282
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Okay!

283
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,133
Mr. Akiba!

284
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,033
Mr. Akiba...

285
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:50,100
Mr. Akiba.

286
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,600
F-Full Moon!

287
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:11,566
Mr. Akiba, please don't quit.

288
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:14,766
You came all the way here,
just to tell me that?!

289
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,666
Yes. You can't quit, Mr. Akiba.

290
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:23,000
No, if I'm around,
I'll just cause everyone trouble.

291
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,100
I've already decided.

292
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:30,066
But have you given up
your dream of nurturing a singer?!

293
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,966
Mr. Akiba.

294
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,733
<i>The train for Akita is
about to depart from track.</i>

295
00:18:40,766 --> 00:18:42,500
Well, I'll be going now.

296
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:47,100
Mr. Akiba, please don't give up.

297
00:18:49,266 --> 00:18:52,666
You might have sad moments
until your dream comes true,

298
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,566
but nothing will remain
if you give up!

299
00:19:04,866 --> 00:19:05,900
Mr. Akiba!

300
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,666
Don't give up. Mr. Akiba!

301
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,933
There he goes.

302
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:52,400
It seems like many things happened
while I was away, Mitsuki.

303
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,100
Mr. Takasu had lots
of trouble as well,

304
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:59,733
but it was lucky because the songs
remained on a different computer.

305
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,333
What? Then you're saying
the songs are not erased?

306
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:03,633
No, by and large.

307
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:05,933
Thank goodness.

308
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:07,833
What?

309
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,400
Then Mr. Akiba doesn't
need to quit the company.

310
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,266
Hey, Mitsuki. Can you come
along with me today?

311
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,366
Huh?

312
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:27,900
Okay, we're here.

313
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,400
Ms. Oshige, what is this?

314
00:20:31,366 --> 00:20:33,300
The store that sells
Full Moon merchandise.

315
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,666
What? Mine?!

316
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:43,100
Manager, about
the wiring over here...

317
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,966
I actually want to place
the display at this spot,

318
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,700
so please have the power source
go around on the opposite side

319
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:51,033
and also increase
the number of switches.

320
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:52,733
Yeah, got that.

321
00:20:54,566 --> 00:20:56,433
Mr. Akiba...

322
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:00,266
Full Moon! Ms. Oshige!

323
00:21:02,633 --> 00:21:05,566
Welcome! You two are
the first customers.

324
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:09,400
Mr. Akiba, I thought you went
back to the countryside.

325
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,366
And you're a store manager?

326
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:15,900
What Full Moon said was right.
I shouldn't give up.

327
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,833
That's why I'll start again from
the beginning as a store manager here.

328
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:22,166
My best regards, Full Moon.

329
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,800
Congratulations.

330
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,433
Thank you very much.

331
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:36,700
Please allow me to
continue supporting you.

332
00:21:37,233 --> 00:21:39,800
Thank you...I'll work hard too.

333
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,766
Isn't this great, Tact?!

334
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,066
Huh? What is?

335
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,633
I'm talking about that girl.

336
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,033
She's about to experience
some summer love.

337
00:23:28,066 --> 00:23:29,866
I'm rooting for her!

338
00:23:30,066 --> 00:23:32,033
You idiot!
That'll never happen!

339
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:34,800
She'd never fall for
some suspicious guy like that!

340
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:37,566
You're jealous, Tact!

341
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,233
That's terrible!
You already have me!

342
00:23:40,266 --> 00:23:41,900
Shut up!
It's not like that!

343
00:23:42,266 --> 00:23:45,700
Next time on Full Moon:
"First Kiss!"

344
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,166
- Don't miss it!
- Don't miss it!
