1
00:00:05,866 --> 00:00:08,066
Meet Mitsuki Koyama,
12 years old.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,833
Her debut song, "Myself" is
a big hit and

3
00:00:09,866 --> 00:00:12,266
she wanted Dr. Wakaoji's opinion
of the song

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,166
but he said he didn't listen
to music anymore.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,200
We all went after him in an attempt
to get him to listen to the song,

6
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:19,600
and we finally found him at
Mitsuki's parents' grave.

7
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:24,966
His true feelings toward music, revealed
at their grave, touched Mitsuki.

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,300
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

9
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,033
Got that?

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,166
Yes.

11
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:18,066
Oh, here it is! It's this person!

12
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,733
- Huh?
- What's going on?

13
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:23,100
I'm going to be on TV together
with this person tomorrow.

14
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:26,933
No kidding. "Fuyuko Komaki"?
Is she a geisha?

15
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:29,966
Idiot! Is everyone who wears
a kimono a geisha?

16
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:33,033
- She's an enka singer.
- An enka singer?

17
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,633
Why are you going to perform with
such a person?

18
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:38,500
You're an idol, aren't you?

19
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,800
Yeah. It seems this Miss Komaki
is going to do a music show

20
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:46,200
where she'll have
newcomer idols as guests.

21
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,633
And it turns out I'm going to
be on that show.

22
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:55,433
What's this, "From here on, I'd like
to sternly educate the next generation..."?

23
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:58,933
I see.
It's the gateway to idol success.

24
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:02,100
Gateway to success? What's that?

25
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,100
Well, I guess it's a path that you
must pass through in order to succeed.

26
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,433
Then say so in the first place.

27
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,400
"Gateway to success," he says.
You're sounding like an old man, Takuto!

28
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:18,866
Oh, I see. Meroko, you didn't know what
gateway to success meant, right?

29
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:21,333
Of course I did!

30
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:24,766
In the first place,
I'm older than you, Takuto!

31
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:29,000
Then if I'm an old man,
you're a really old lady, Meroko.

32
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:30,566
Whaaat?!

33
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,700
Hey! Takuto!

34
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,100
- What?! How mean!
- Oww! Cut it out!

35
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:37,466
- How could you say I'm an old lady?!
- Hey! Cut it out, Meroko! You're tickling me!

36
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,933
- I'm just a little older, you know!
- No, not there!

37
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:41,000
<i>This will be my first trial.</i>

38
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,833
<i>Eichi. I'll do my best.</i>

39
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:03,566
Wow! A television studio's
really big, isn't it?

40
00:04:03,766 --> 00:04:04,900
Uh-huh...

41
00:04:05,366 --> 00:04:05,966
Oh!

42
00:04:06,566 --> 00:04:09,233
It's the weather girl I like!

43
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,300
Ahhh, to think I could
meet her here.

44
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,066
Oh! I've seen that person before
in a magazine!

45
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,000
Aww, I should've brought
my autograph book.

46
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,400
S-Stop that, Mitsuki.

47
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:22,100
Huh?

48
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:25,000
You're also one of them now.

49
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,633
Oh...I'm sorry.

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,400
More importantly, be sure to greet
Miss Komaki when you see her.

51
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:35,866
She's really picky about stuff
like that, so...

52
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:37,000
Okay.

53
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,800
And the greeting in
show business isn't "Hello," but...

54
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,333
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

55
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:44,066
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

56
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:45,600
Good morning!

57
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:48,166
Good morning! We look forward to
working with you today.

58
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,233
Good morning.

59
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,400
Oh! Oh no!

60
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:56,033
<i>Huh? "Good morning"?
Even though it's afternoon?</i>

61
00:04:58,066 --> 00:05:00,066
Good morning, Miss Komaki.

62
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,966
We will have the pleasure of
working with you today.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,100
This is Full Moon, and
I am her manager, Masami Oshige.

64
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:07,000
Oh, hello.

65
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:09,266
So where's this "Full Moon"?

66
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:10,200
What?

67
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:13,966
Huh?! Mitsuki?!

68
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:18,500
Let's go, Tadokoro.

69
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,266
What?! Oh, umm!

70
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,366
Okay, see you later.

71
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:31,100
<i>It's Miss Komaki,
so be sure to greet her!</i>

72
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:39,233
Oh... H-Hello...

73
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:46,566
Hey, wasn't that Komaki,
just now?

74
00:05:46,633 --> 00:05:49,833
What? That was Miss Komaki?

75
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,666
Th-That's right...
Ohh, I messed up.

76
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,266
Why didn't you come with me?

77
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:56,433
Huh?

78
00:05:56,633 --> 00:05:59,033
You didn't know that was
Miss Komaki just now?

79
00:05:59,066 --> 00:05:59,833
Huh?

80
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:01,966
Oh, I'm sorry.
She wasn't wearing a kimono, so...

81
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,566
Enka singers wear jeans, too,
you know!

82
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:07,266
More importantly,
were you sure to greet her?

83
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,100
Huh? Yeah...
Kind of...

84
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:12,533
Hmm, I'm kind of worried...

85
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,400
MISS FUYUKO KOMAKI'S
DRESSING ROOM

86
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:17,100
Listen up.

87
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,700
This time, be sure to greet by saying,
"Good morning."

88
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:21,333
Okay.

89
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,233
Here we go!

90
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,633
May we come in?
It's Masami Oshige.

91
00:06:29,366 --> 00:06:30,966
I'm sorry about before.

92
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:33,800
Once again, we will have the pleasure
of working with you today.

93
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,433
This is Full Moon, and
I am her manager, Masami Oshige.

94
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:39,500
Good morning. I'm Full Moon.

95
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,900
I'm looking forward to
working with you today.

96
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:44,300
Nice to meet you.
I'm Fuyuko Komaki.

97
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:45,600
Glad to have you here today.

98
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:50,300
She's new, so I'm sure she will
cause some inconvenience, but...

99
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:50,900
Oh!

100
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,400
Wow!

101
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:54,300
H-Hey, Mitsuki!

102
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,766
Wow! Kimonos sure
are beautiful, aren't they?

103
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,733
Miss Komaki, it's just like
the Shichigosan Festival!

104
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:01,266
Oh...

105
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,533
- Huh?
- Oh...

106
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:15,533
Aww, I messed up.
Miss Oshige seemed very depressed.

107
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:20,966
What should I do?
It's my fault.

108
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,366
Even so, that Komaki is really
an obnoxious old lady, isn't she?

109
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:27,000
Are you sure you should be
saying those things?

110
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:28,100
Shut up!

111
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:33,033
Jeez. That Komaki is really
an obnoxious old lady, isn't she?

112
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,866
And that balding guy who's
always by her side is creepy, too!

113
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:39,900
Oh, Tadokoro, right?
He's creepy, isn't he?

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,500
He's always kissing butt.

115
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:45,866
That being said, you were bowing
to Komaki, too.

116
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:49,533
Well, in order to survive in
show business, it can't be helped.

117
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,533
It's almost time for rehearsal,
so let's go.

118
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:55,866
Okay.

119
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,166
What was up with that?
How obnoxious.

120
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,966
How can you say that?

121
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,100
Oh, that's dangerous.

122
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:04,800
They should be sure to
put out their cigarettes.

123
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:06,466
You!

124
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:10,000
What're you doing smoking?!
You're a minor, right?!

125
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,233
Huh? Oh...

126
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:14,600
Really! Entertainers lately get
full of themselves so quickly!

127
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:15,500
Oh, no...

128
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:19,000
The people who were here earlier
didn't put out their cigarettes, so I...

129
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:22,033
My! To talk back after being admonished!

130
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:25,433
Jeez, kids today!
Unthinkable in the old days!

131
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,200
What?

132
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,333
Oh... Umm...

133
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:34,566
But it wasn't like that...

134
00:08:34,733 --> 00:08:36,600
She's really an aggravating
old lady, isn't she?!

135
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,533
There's no way this girl would smoke.
I'm sooo annoyed!

136
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,766
H-Hey, Meroko.

137
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:45,366
Where are you going?!

138
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,100
Huh? Hey, you two!

139
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:48,466
Mitsuki.

140
00:08:48,966 --> 00:08:50,833
It's almost time for rehearsal.

141
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,433
This time, let's pull it together so
we don't get scolded by Miss Komaki!

142
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,333
Okay.

143
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,700
Test, test.

144
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,200
Mic check... Mic check...

145
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:06,066
Wow!

146
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:15,133
There's a lot of staff here.

147
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,166
That's right.

148
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,533
Everyone's working hard
to broadcast your song.

149
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:23,300
Okay, Miss Full Moon.
Please stand by.

150
00:09:23,466 --> 00:09:24,866
Go on. Do your best.

151
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,833
I-I will.

152
00:09:33,466 --> 00:09:35,300
Okay. Then let's give it a go.

153
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,133
Okay, here we go.
Five seconds to go.

154
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,966
Four! Three!

155
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,333
<i>Why do I like you so much?</i>

156
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:53,166
<i>My tears are falling...</i>

157
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:56,300
Cut!

158
00:09:56,966 --> 00:09:58,366
What's she doing?

159
00:09:58,633 --> 00:09:59,800
Are you okay?

160
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,933
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,733
It was so sudden,
I got startled.

162
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,700
I see. I'll be shooting the same way
during the actual show, too.

163
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:07,166
So please don't be alarmed.

164
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,766
All right...

165
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,400
Okay, let's go once more.

166
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,366
Five seconds to go. Four, three...

167
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:24,933
<i>Why do I like you so much...</i>

168
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:31,000
The lasers go off in the intro! Okay, go!

169
00:10:44,966 --> 00:10:45,900
Cut!

170
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:48,466
Does that girl think something's
going to happen to her

171
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,300
if she gets hit by the lasers?

172
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,333
We can leave her on the back burner.

173
00:10:52,366 --> 00:10:54,066
Let's do Miss Komaki's part first.

174
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,700
Okay.

175
00:10:55,266 --> 00:10:57,900
Okay, we're changing the lights.
Please stand by.

176
00:10:57,933 --> 00:11:02,600
We're going to take a break.
So in the meantime, talk to Miss Full Moon.

177
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:05,766
I understand. I'll calm her down.

178
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,633
All right, thank you.

179
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:09,933
We're taking a break.

180
00:11:11,566 --> 00:11:12,433
Oh?

181
00:11:32,966 --> 00:11:36,333
So by leaving her and
bolting out on your own,

182
00:11:36,366 --> 00:11:37,433
what're you going to do?

183
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:38,966
- Oh!
- Huh?

184
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:40,566
There he is.

185
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,266
Huh?

186
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,733
Look, that guy!

187
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,533
Huh?

188
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:48,233
The band guy who was in the magazine...
that girl was reading last night!

189
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,833
<i>I'm going to be on TV together
with this person tomorrow.</i>

190
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,933
Yaaaaah! How handsome!

191
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:59,100
Say! You're not looking for Komaki?!

192
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,866
Jeez, you're annoying.

193
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,566
It should be okay if
I stop off for a bit, right?!

194
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:08,600
Or could it be that you're jealous?

195
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,666
Huh?! Why would I be jealous?

196
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,700
Could this be my first "date"
in awhile?

197
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:19,933
Well, I feel bad for leaving
that girl alone, but...

198
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,700
I'm a heartless little devil, Meroko.

199
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,200
But you're a Death Spirit.

200
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:26,966
I know it's work,
but Fuyuko Komaki, huh...

201
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,933
- Huh?
- Huh?

202
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:31,066
I've started getting nervous, Takeda.

203
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:35,200
You have your cute points, too, eh, Ono.

204
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:37,066
Please stop kidding around.

205
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:40,833
Hey, Meroko.
Isn't that guy the "Myojo" reporter?

206
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,000
Huh?! That guy who was doing
the interview before?

207
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,600
Don't get so serious, Ono.

208
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,133
Although she may not look it,
Komaki's a pretty good person.

209
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,666
But I've heard
unpleasant stories about her.

210
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,600
Like she's temperamental,
she kicks around newcomers...

211
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:57,666
all kinds of stories.

212
00:12:58,033 --> 00:13:01,766
Well, it's certain that she's stern
to the extent that she's misunderstood.

213
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,566
But that's her style of affection.

214
00:13:04,966 --> 00:13:08,800
She just doesn't want them to fall in
to the same trap she fell.

215
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:09,800
Oh...

216
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:13,266
That thing a long time ago about her
being forced to become an idol?

217
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah. At the time of her debut,

218
00:13:16,033 --> 00:13:18,500
she was forced to sing songs
she didn't want to sing.

219
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:24,100
Giving in to despair, smoking and
drinking and wasting her precious voice...

220
00:13:24,766 --> 00:13:29,400
Memories from the past might
unintentionally come out with strong words.

221
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,000
I get it.

222
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,000
But, was her voice that good?

223
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:35,933
Yeah... How can I describe it?

224
00:13:35,966 --> 00:13:39,566
It was like it'd slowly sink
into your heart.

225
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:43,433
There haven't been
any singers like that, lately...

226
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,000
Is that so?

227
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:50,566
I see. So that's why
she got angry like that...

228
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,833
She might be a good person.

229
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,133
Umm, and so...

230
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,033
There was a sudden change
in plans.

231
00:13:58,066 --> 00:14:00,133
Now, your recording will be
done first, Miss Komaki.

232
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:04,133
I said that was no good,
but the director insisted.

233
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,400
I understand.

234
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,566
R-Really? Well, thank you.

235
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:11,600
But jeez, what is
that new girl thinking?

236
00:14:11,866 --> 00:14:16,266
Saying rude things to you,
and now messing up your schedule!

237
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:20,100
She is truly a rude person!
Right, Miss Komaki?

238
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:23,900
Miss Komaki!

239
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:26,566
So the story goes.

240
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,666
I see... That was it...

241
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:33,200
I keep doing more and more
bad things to Miss Komaki.

242
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:36,333
Okay! I'll have to be sure
to apologize to her later!

243
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,300
Right.

244
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:38,133
Yeah.

245
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,800
Miss Komaki is coming in.

246
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:40,766
- Huh?
- Oh!

247
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:43,633
Here I go.

248
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:48,366
I'm sorry, Miss Komaki.

249
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,600
Huh?

250
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,300
Okay. Enough with the act.
Just get on out of here.

251
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,600
Oh, uh, well...

252
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,400
Huh?!

253
00:14:58,866 --> 00:14:59,933
What's the meaning of this?!

254
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,100
What? What does this mean?

255
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:04,066
Miss Komaki will be recording from now.

256
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:07,866
I can't have you
do anything more

257
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,566
that would interfere
with her singing!

258
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:16,900
Why'd that guy throw Mitsuki out?

259
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,866
I bet Komaki told him to.

260
00:15:19,966 --> 00:15:22,600
Oh! See?
She was a disagreeable person!

261
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:25,000
Jeez, what an outrageous newcomer.

262
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:29,233
I know. Let's get rid of
that Full Moon's song

263
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:32,300
and use that part for an advertisement
for Miss Komaki's new song.

264
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,033
Uh-huh...

265
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,133
Hey, what's he talking about?!

266
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,300
Takuto, we have to let her know!

267
00:15:37,466 --> 00:15:38,100
Yeah!

268
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:40,766
What? They won't let me sing?!

269
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,833
It seems so.

270
00:15:41,866 --> 00:15:44,200
I knew she was a bad person!

271
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,966
That's harsh.

272
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:51,500
Hey, what's the meaning of this?!

273
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:55,166
Why no song recording
for our Full Moon?!

274
00:15:55,366 --> 00:15:56,733
But it can't be helped, can it?

275
00:15:56,766 --> 00:15:59,566
She's done nothing
but rude things to Miss Komaki.

276
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
To even have
her schedule messed up...

277
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:04,700
Miss Komaki doesn't have
time to spare like you guys!

278
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,466
- Oh?!
- Hey!

279
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,033
But that's just too harsh!

280
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:11,466
- Mitsuki!
- Huh?

281
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:15,866
Miss Komaki!

282
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,833
Miss Komaki! Is it true that
I won't be allowed to sing?!

283
00:16:23,366 --> 00:16:24,600
What're you talking about?

284
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,100
But, Mr. Tadokoro said...

285
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,400
<i>He did something again, huh?</i>

286
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,700
I did many rude things
to you, Miss Komaki.

287
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:36,100
But not being allowed to sing
is just too much.

288
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:37,566
It's my first TV appearance.

289
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,133
I must sing and then quickly...

290
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,433
Quickly what?

291
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,800
You want to quickly get famous, sell,
and get lots of attention or something?

292
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,900
No!

293
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:46,366
Then, what is it?

294
00:16:46,566 --> 00:16:49,500
If it's not that, why did you think
to become a singer?

295
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:52,066
A promise...

296
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,600
I made a promise...
with someone special...

297
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:58,300
Someone special?

298
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,666
Yes. I don't know where
that person is right now.

299
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:04,266
But we made a promise!

300
00:17:04,433 --> 00:17:07,366
We promised to reach for
our respective dreams and do our best...

301
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,700
So I'll keep singing and...

302
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:11,133
Think again.

303
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:11,800
What?

304
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:14,433
You've got your head up
in the clouds!

305
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:19,033
You'll give your all to singing and
eventually forget about some silly promise!

306
00:17:19,266 --> 00:17:21,500
You'll just be singing for work!

307
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:22,300
No way!

308
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,966
Then...

309
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:31,833
Then, you're just singing
because it's your job, Miss Komaki?

310
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:35,366
Yes...I am a professional.

311
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,266
I don't think so...

312
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:40,200
I don't think so!

313
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:45,466
I want to sing, cherishing
such feelings!

314
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,500
If I can't, then I don't care
if I'm not a professional!

315
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,066
All I want to do is sing songs
that resonates in the hearts of people!

316
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:11,133
All right, Miss Full Moon.
If you would!

317
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,933
What? But I thought I couldn't sing.

318
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:14,200
It's okay.

319
00:18:14,233 --> 00:18:14,866
What?

320
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,066
That whole thing was all
that balding guy's idea.

321
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,366
So you don't need to worry.
You can sing!

322
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,033
Right!

323
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,366
Okay, let's go once again.

324
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,066
Five!

325
00:18:33,266 --> 00:18:34,166
Four!

326
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:35,066
Three!

327
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,033
<i>Why do I like you so much?</i>

328
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:49,833
<i>My tears are falling</i>

329
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:58,333
<i>Mitsuki, promise me. That we'll be closer
to our dreams when we meet next.</i>

330
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,433
<i>Yes.</i>

331
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:09,000
<i>Because in the past there were
a lot of things I lost</i>

332
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:12,466
<i>And I couldn't sing</i>

333
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,700
<i>Okay, so we'll sell her as an idol.</i>

334
00:19:14,866 --> 00:19:16,400
<i>That's it then.</i>

335
00:19:16,733 --> 00:19:20,733
<i>Wait please!
I want to sing traditional songs!</i>

336
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,000
<i>was where I belonged</i>

337
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,333
<i>I found a loneliness...</i>

338
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:29,733
<i>Wait please!</i>

339
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,766
<i>in your eyes that day...</i>

340
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,233
<i>I don't think so!</i>

341
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,900
<i>I want to sing, cherishing
such feelings!</i>

342
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,466
<i>If I can't, then I don't care
if I'm not a professional.</i>

343
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,666
<i>All I want to do is sing songs that
reverberate in the hearts of people!</i>

344
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,466
<i>Why do I like you so much?</i>

345
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,766
<i>Your voice echoes and
it sounds almost sad...</i>

346
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,200
Yes. That's nice!

347
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:07,000
This rivals the old Fuyuko Komaki.

348
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:11,066
<i>I realize, now that I'm far away</i>

349
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,233
<i>What was supporting me</i>

350
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,066
Miss Komaki...

351
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,833
Why do you do such selfish things?!

352
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,233
As of tomorrow,
you don't have to come anymore!

353
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,200
Miss Komaki!

354
00:20:25,466 --> 00:20:27,800
Miss Komaki!

355
00:20:31,366 --> 00:20:32,933
Hey, look at this.

356
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:35,933
Oh, Miss Komaki.
Huh? Mr. Takeda, too?

357
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:40,766
Miss Komaki is recently putting
much effort into the fostering of newcomers.

358
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,733
So, how are the kids, these days?

359
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:44,133
Let me see.

360
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,433
Today, there was this one kid
who didn't greet me,

361
00:20:46,466 --> 00:20:49,000
looked at a person's kimono and
said it was like shichigosan.

362
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:51,500
And to top it off, this kid made error
after error during rehearsal,

363
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:56,033
disrupted my schedule and
really gave me a hard time.

364
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
That must have been rough.

365
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,333
But...

366
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,900
this girl was a bit different from
the newcomers until now.

367
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:08,300
She was able to express
legitimate opinions to me.

368
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,600
Really?

369
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:13,366
It's embarrassing to talk about,
but I feel like

370
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,966
she got me to remember
what is most important as a singer.

371
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,666
It was like remembering why
I started this in the first place.

372
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,966
Then, this will have
an affect on your future?

373
00:21:26,433 --> 00:21:31,133
Yes. That girl might have
woken me up.

374
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,933
So...

375
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:37,433
Until the day we meet again,
do your best. Okay, Miss Newcomer?

376
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:41,433
I will!

377
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,366
This is bad, Takuto!

378
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,066
Mitsuki's being targeted
by a tabloid photographer!

379
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,500
If this keeps going on,
her secret will be found out!

380
00:23:25,533 --> 00:23:29,866
Damn! Her true identity
must not be revealed!

381
00:23:30,133 --> 00:23:32,000
Hold on, Mitsuki. I'll save you!

382
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:35,733
Hey! You're not ready to handle this on
your own. You're still a rookie!

383
00:23:35,766 --> 00:23:40,033
Shut up! I'll protect her,
no matter what!

384
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,966
Next time on Full Moon:
"The Dangerous Lens."

385
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,566
- Don't miss it!
- Don't miss it!
