1
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,566
Eichi...

2
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:16,500
This is where you were?

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,833
Mitsuki!

4
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:20,600
Answer us!

5
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:22,466
Mitsuki!

6
00:00:22,633 --> 00:00:23,833
Where are you?!

7
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:33,333
<i>Eichi, please hurry and get me.</i>
<i>I'm here. I'll be right here.</i>

8
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:34,400
<i>I'm begging you!</i>
<i>Please be safe!</i>

9
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:35,966
<i>Mitsuki!</i>

10
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,933
<i>Mitsuki!</i>

11
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:48,600
<i>Mitsuki! Mitsuki!</i>

12
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:50,466
<i>Mitsuki!</i>

13
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,700
<i>You idiot!</i>

14
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
<i>This plane will be landing</i>
<i>at Narita Airport shortly.</i>

15
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,533
- Mitsuki...
<i>- Please check your seatbelts once again</i>

16
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:10,633
<i>to make sure they</i>
<i>are securely fastened.</i>

17
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,766
I would've never imagined that our trip
to America would be so painful.

18
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:19,300
Yes.

19
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,900
Grandma!

20
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,366
She came to the airport
to meet us?

21
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,900
I contacted her before
we left America.

22
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:52,633
Mitsuki.

23
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,600
Grandma...

24
00:03:57,766 --> 00:03:59,866
Mi...Mitsuki?

25
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,400
Mrs. Koyama,
this was all my—

26
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:04,433
Dr. Wakaoji!

27
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:08,333
You told me that going to America
would be good for Mitsuki, did you not?

28
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:10,100
Yes.

29
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:11,866
And this is the result?

30
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,133
I was opposed to
the trip to America.

31
00:04:16,566 --> 00:04:18,400
But I persuaded myself that

32
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:21,733
since it would be with the doctor
who Mitsuki trusted, it would be okay.

33
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:23,933
I'm sorry.

34
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:24,733
Umm...

35
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:28,233
Right now, Mitsuki needs
all the support she can get.

36
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:31,166
So...please...please...
support Mitsuki!

37
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:33,833
I don't need you to tell me
something I already know.

38
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,066
Let's go, Mitsuki.

39
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,566
I'll take you to the car!

40
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
That will not be necessary!

41
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,766
In that case...
I'll deliver her luggage later.

42
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:56,833
Dr. Wakaoji, I cannot entrust
her to you any longer.

43
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,100
From now on, please stay
out of our family's affairs.

44
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:04,733
Of course,
I will switch hospitals as well!

45
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:14,333
Hey, wait! I'll let you know
if something happens!

46
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:17,133
Takuto!

47
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,933
Listen carefully, Mitsuki.
When you—

48
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:37,966
Grandma.

49
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,033
I'll never sing again.

50
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,566
I'll give up my dream
of becoming a singer.

51
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:52,266
From now on, I will always do
exactly what you tell me to do.

52
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,300
I-I see. You finally understand.

53
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,133
I've been telling you
all along, haven't I?

54
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,833
That music only
creates unhappiness.

55
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,733
You've finally come to
understand that, haven't you?

56
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:07,300
It was exactly as I told you,
wasn't it?

57
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:10,666
Yes, it really was.

58
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,066
I can't watch her any longer.

59
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:39,200
I...

60
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:42,533
Did she really mean it when
she said she'd never sing again?

61
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:44,333
And also, Takuto...

62
00:06:46,966 --> 00:06:48,966
Those backward letters
won't go away.

63
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:51,466
If things continue this way,
Mitsuki will really—

64
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:55,800
That's right, she'll leave this world
before she's able to live out her lifespan.

65
00:06:58,366 --> 00:06:59,500
Hello!

66
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:01,933
How are you,
Mero and Takuto?

67
00:07:02,966 --> 00:07:05,633
You seem to be worrying about
unimportant things as usual.

68
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:10,066
Unimportant?!
What do you know?!

69
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:11,433
Takuto!

70
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:16,500
Izumi, don't stick your nose into this.
This is Green Onion Ramen's work.

71
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:18,666
It has nothing to
do with you, Izumi!

72
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Work, huh?

73
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,066
But, to be blunt, it's more
than just work for you

74
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,400
when it comes to that girl,
isn't it?

75
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,166
That's why I, as a Death Spirit
with more experience,

76
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,633
have come to give you
some advice.

77
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:31,066
Advice?

78
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:35,300
That's right. I promise not to tell
the Division Chief of Death Spirits,

79
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:39,000
but you should just reap her life
and store it somewhere.

80
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,166
What did you say?!

81
00:07:40,366 --> 00:07:42,300
You jerk, stop saying
whatever you want!

82
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:45,533
Yeah! That goes against
the duties of a Death Spirit!

83
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,700
As a general rule, yes.

84
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:52,100
But, in Mitsuki's current state,
she's just like a corpse waiting to die.

85
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,966
If she were to continue
living until spring,

86
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,033
don't you think it would
be just too pitiful?

87
00:07:57,466 --> 00:07:59,200
How pitiful.

88
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,366
Well, see you.

89
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:05,133
If there's anything I can do to help,
just let me know.

90
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,166
Bye, Mero.

91
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:10,600
See you around.

92
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,766
You jerk.
Stop messing with us!

93
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,466
But Takuto...

94
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:19,900
With Mitsuki as she is now...
it may be just as Izumi says.

95
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:29,166
I don't know what to do anymore.
What can we do at this point?

96
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,100
How is she?

97
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:43,300
Hmm... Well...

98
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,933
I really can't say
anything conclusive

99
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:49,500
until I have seen the results
of the extensive tests.

100
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:50,766
I see.

101
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:56,200
Mitsuki, I need to speak with the doctor,
so please wait outside.

102
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,433
All right.

103
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:10,533
She's a very
sweet granddaughter,

104
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:12,033
listening to what
her grandmother tells her.

105
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:13,633
You're too kind.

106
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:25,666
I'm really sorry!

107
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,466
You really did it this time!

108
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:30,300
I don't intend to
make any excuses.

109
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,066
This is make or break time
for Full Moon!

110
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:34,966
What in the world
are you thinking,

111
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,466
giving her time off
on your own authority!

112
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,300
Can you really call yourself
a professional manager?

113
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,133
You can go home for today.
I will contact you later.

114
00:09:58,266 --> 00:09:58,933
<i>What?!</i>

115
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,766
<i>Full Moon cancelled?</i>

116
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,333
<i>That's right.</i>

117
00:10:02,466 --> 00:10:04,200
<i>She was supposed</i>
<i>to be today's guest,</i>

118
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:06,033
<i>but she cancelled</i>
<i>because of health issues.</i>

119
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:07,500
<i>That's unfortunate!</i>

120
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,933
<i>I hope she comes back</i>
<i>to work soon!</i>

121
00:10:09,966 --> 00:10:10,633
<i>Yes.</i>

122
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:11,800
<i>The other guests are...</i>

123
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,300
<i>Madoka Wakamatsu,</i>
<i>Shonen Drill...</i>

124
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:23,900
Dr. Wakaoji...

125
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Welcome home.

126
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
It makes me sad that
you didn't consult me.

127
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:31,433
I'm sorry.

128
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,833
It's true that the only
option right now is for

129
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:38,066
Mitsuki to take some time off because
she isn't healthy enough to work.

130
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:40,500
But you could have at least
said something to me.

131
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:44,766
No. I think it was better that
I made that decision alone.

132
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:49,533
My office may fire me,

133
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:53,033
since I gave our number one idol
time off without permission.

134
00:10:53,766 --> 00:10:57,833
Hopefully it will end with me being fired
and not turn into a liability issue.

135
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,866
That's why it's better that you're
not involved in this, Dr. Wakaoji.

136
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:08,166
It would make me very angry if you
really meant what you just said.

137
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:09,433
Huh?

138
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:13,533
I am Mitsuki's main doctor
as well as Full Moon's producer.

139
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:17,766
So you, as her manager,
and I share a common destiny.

140
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,533
Dr. Wakaoji...

141
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,566
Don't try to shoulder
all the responsibilities.

142
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:24,933
Please depend on me more.

143
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,500
I wasn't able to do anything.

144
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:39,533
Even though I had
decided to support Mitsuki

145
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:42,433
not only as a singer
but also as a girl.

146
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,700
Not just as a manager who is
in charge of her schedule,

147
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:51,266
but as someone who truly cares about
what is going on in Mitsuki's heart.

148
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,066
But I...

149
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,766
I wasn't able to do anything.

150
00:11:56,566 --> 00:12:00,533
Even now when Mitsuki is in
such distress, I can't do anything.

151
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:07,866
I thought I understood Mitsuki well.
But I'm not even able to help at all.

152
00:12:09,966 --> 00:12:13,200
Don't say anymore.
Don't blame yourself like that.

153
00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:54,133
Thank you for the meal.

154
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:55,900
Huh? You're already done?

155
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,433
Mitsuki, finish what's
on your plate.

156
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,366
I'm sorry.

157
00:13:04,966 --> 00:13:06,400
Umm... Mitsuki?

158
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:13,966
I wonder if I didn't
season it well.

159
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:28,400
Wait a second!

160
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:29,533
Why?!

161
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:30,600
Because I said so!

162
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:34,166
But Mitsuki said she
was giving up singing!

163
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:36,000
She's getting
weaker and weaker.

164
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:37,900
We need to report this
to those two!

165
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:43,533
I can't believe that she meant it
when she said that.

166
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
There's no way she would
be able to give up singing!

167
00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:48,866
Takuto...

168
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,600
If we tell her manager
and Wakaoji right now,

169
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:54,200
it would just
worry them more.

170
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,933
Let's monitor the situation
a little bit longer. Please!

171
00:13:58,433 --> 00:13:59,433
All right.

172
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:04,300
But...I wonder if the day will really
come when Mitsuki sings again.

173
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:34,300
Mitsuki, are you cold?

174
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,066
No.

175
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,900
You should lie down a little
when we get home.

176
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:40,800
Okay.

177
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:46,066
Is there anything you want?

178
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,666
No, nothing in particular.

179
00:14:50,433 --> 00:14:51,466
I see.

180
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:02,866
Full Moon wasn't on TV
the other day.

181
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,300
Maybe she's taking time off
from work again?

182
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,533
No, it might be a new kind
of promotion tactic.

183
00:15:07,566 --> 00:15:09,666
There's no way
it's a promotion tactic!

184
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,966
There's no way that girl would
take a break from singing

185
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,633
to use such a feeble tactic!

186
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,100
What's up with her?

187
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:17,366
How weird.

188
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,400
Hey, let's go.

189
00:15:19,766 --> 00:15:20,433
<i>That's right!</i>

190
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:24,966
<i>There's no way that dumb Full Moon</i>
<i>would stop singing for no reason!</i>

191
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,233
<i>It's Full Moon who's always</i>
<i>singing with carefree abandon!</i>

192
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:29,200
I know!

193
00:15:29,366 --> 00:15:31,066
Something happened!

194
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:39,200
What is that?

195
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:40,666
Oh... Ma'am.

196
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,733
Is that for Mitsuki?

197
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:43,600
Yes.

198
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,633
Mitsuki doesn't have
any appetite these days!

199
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:51,633
I thought maybe she would eat
her favorite taiyaki from Shunpudo.

200
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:53,933
I'll do it.

201
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:55,133
Huh?

202
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,533
I will bring them to her.

203
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,666
Huh?!

204
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,866
Umm... Ma'am...

205
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,700
Madam has changed.

206
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,766
I wonder if there's going to be
a natural disaster of some sort.

207
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:29,766
Mitsuki!

208
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:35,433
Mitsuki.

209
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,333
Grandma...

210
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,566
Ms. Tanaka bought
these for you.

211
00:16:43,366 --> 00:16:48,266
She's worried about you because you
haven't been eating much these days.

212
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:54,500
Thank you very much.
But I'm not hungry.

213
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:57,033
I see.

214
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:22,433
How is she?
The test results are in, aren't they?

215
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,133
It's a very difficult
situation after all.

216
00:17:26,433 --> 00:17:28,433
I believe that we should
go ahead and operate.

217
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:29,833
Huh?

218
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:30,533
Operate?

219
00:17:30,866 --> 00:17:33,566
Umm... Will that affect
the vocal cords?

220
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:36,200
Yes, I have to tell you that

221
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:38,633
there is definitely a possibility
that she will lose her voice.

222
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,366
Doctor, if she has the operation,
she will be saved, right?

223
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,066
I won't do it.

224
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:55,333
I absolutely won't do it.
I won't have the operation.

225
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:58,733
I don't want to lose my voice.

226
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,300
M-Mitsuki! Do you understand
what you're saying?!

227
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,966
If you don't have the operation,
you will...

228
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,800
I don't care what
happens to me.

229
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:09,600
Huh?

230
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:12,366
I don't care anymore.

231
00:18:16,766 --> 00:18:19,633
Hey! Do you really mean
what you just said?!

232
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,033
H-Hey, Takuto!

233
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,400
Until just recently,
you were saying that

234
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:26,033
you would live the short life
you were given to the fullest!

235
00:18:26,466 --> 00:18:27,866
But now you're saying

236
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,100
you will never sing again
and that you don't care!

237
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,033
That's not like you, Mitsuki!

238
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:33,700
Takuto, calm down!

239
00:18:34,766 --> 00:18:35,766
Damn this!

240
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:45,766
Why?! Why won't you sing?
You loved singing so much!

241
00:18:47,766 --> 00:18:52,800
I'll transform you as many
times as you want!

242
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:58,666
She's not transforming!

243
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,166
No way!

244
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Why?

245
00:19:08,566 --> 00:19:10,533
Unless Mitsuki has the desire,

246
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:14,133
we won't be able to transform her
with our Death Spirit powers.

247
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Mitsuki!

248
00:19:16,366 --> 00:19:19,833
I was able contact a different hospital.
Let's hurry over there.

249
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,666
Wait!

250
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,566
<i>She's not herself right now.</i>

251
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,033
<i>The real Mitsuki could</i>
<i>never give up singing.</i>

252
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:45,233
<i>For people who sing,</i>
<i>singing is a testimony of life itself.</i>

253
00:19:46,266 --> 00:19:49,000
<i>I will make her like singing again.</i>

254
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:53,000
<i>Giving up on singing is not something</i>
<i>that you can do so easily.</i>

255
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,000
<i>I know that best.</i>

256
00:19:58,266 --> 00:19:59,300
Ow...

257
00:20:05,266 --> 00:20:06,933
What was that just now?

258
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,433
I agree.

259
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:18,866
This is definitely a condition
that requires surgery.

260
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:21,100
That is your opinion too?

261
00:20:21,766 --> 00:20:24,933
We've gotten the same opinion
from various hospitals.

262
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,400
It would be great if one could operate
without injuring the vocal cords,

263
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:30,866
but that is extremely difficult.

264
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:34,133
I understand that Dr. Lon Herberd
is developing

265
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:38,633
a new operating technique in America,
but it's still unavailable in Japan.

266
00:20:39,466 --> 00:20:43,566
In America? With that technique,
the vocal cords wouldn't be injured?

267
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:47,000
No, though it is
not 100% certain yet.

268
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,866
But in Japan, we just don't
have the facilities or the surgeons.

269
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:57,333
Of those that I know of,
I believe Dr. Wakaoji

270
00:20:57,366 --> 00:21:00,866
at Tanemura General Hospital
is knowledgeable about this.

271
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,066
Dr. Wakaoji?

272
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,033
That's right. There is no better
doctor practicing in that field.

273
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,666
If you'd like, I'd be happy to
write a letter of introduction.

274
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:22,066
Jeez, where did that Takuto go?
I just assumed he was behind us.

275
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,966
<i>My throat...</i>
<i>I don't want to lose my voice.</i>

276
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,866
<i>Because...</i>

277
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,633
<i>Because if I don't continue to call</i>
<i>out to him, Eichi won't turn around.</i>

278
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,433
Takuto, just what do we do?
She's...

279
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:25,966
That can't be! There's no way
she'll stay like this!

280
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,400
But her appetite
is even affected

281
00:23:28,433 --> 00:23:30,233
now that she knows she'll
never see Eichi again.

282
00:23:31,566 --> 00:23:32,566
Wait a second!

283
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,000
Was that Madoka Wakamatsu
that I saw going in to the house?

284
00:23:36,466 --> 00:23:37,766
What is going on?!

285
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:42,666
Next time on Full Moon:
"A Sympathetic Heart."

286
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:44,166
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
