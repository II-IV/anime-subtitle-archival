1
00:00:05,566 --> 00:00:07,233
Kumi consults Mitsuki about love,

2
00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:09,066
believing that Mitsuki is
an expert on love.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,066
I come up with the idea of
writing him a love letter,

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,200
but he ends up thinking
it's from Mitsuki!

5
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:15,433
What do we do?!

6
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:19,100
Mitsuki encourages Kumi to
tell the boy how she feels,

7
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:20,766
and Kumi ends up confessing
her love to him!

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,200
Maybe Mitsuki really is
an expert on love!

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,900
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,700
Got that?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,666
Yes...

12
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:13,200
Have a nice day.

13
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,866
Everybody is out now.

14
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,500
Mitsuki and Takuto are at the event
for the release of the second single.

15
00:02:28,766 --> 00:02:30,666
I'm so bored!

16
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,766
Oh well, I guess I'll watch some TV!

17
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,000
<i>There! Completely white in no time!</i>

18
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:37,066
<i>- Wow!</i>
<i>- Wow!</i>

19
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,033
<i>Put one cup of rice wine into the pan</i>
<i>and cook for 30 minutes.</i>

20
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,666
How boring!

21
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,366
What? Did it break?

22
00:02:58,833 --> 00:02:59,866
W-What is this?!

23
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:05,700
W-What is this?!

24
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:07,300
What in the world is going on?!

25
00:03:07,566 --> 00:03:08,733
Could it be a ghost?

26
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,200
How rude!
Who do you think I am?

27
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:19,233
I am Miss Meroko, a Death Spirit
fearsome enough to silence a crying child!

28
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,100
There!

29
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,333
Y-You're so cruel.

30
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,900
No way! Is it really a ghost?!

31
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:30,466
No, he's a Death Spirit.

32
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,600
That voice... Could it be?

33
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,500
I-Izumi?!

34
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:40,900
It's been a long time, Mero!

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,933
<i>- W-Why did he show up</i>
- Hey, is my nose squashed?

36
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:56,733
<i>- all of a sudden?</i>
- No, I think it actually got bigger.

37
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,633
I-Izumi, why are you here
in the human world?

38
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,366
Should I not have come?

39
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:05,666
I'm not going to be a nuisance...am I?

40
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,233
O-Of course not!

41
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:09,766
It's absurd to think that
you'll be a nuisance!

42
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,400
Of course,
I'm really glad to see you!

43
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:13,766
Yeah, aren't you?

44
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:19,366
Oh yes, this is Jonathan,
who became my partner after you, Mero.

45
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:21,600
Nice to meet you.

46
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:23,300
Nice to meet you.

47
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:27,133
Hey, there is this rumor...

48
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,300
A rumor that Green Onion Ramen
is using Death Spirit powers

49
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:34,100
to become friends
with a human child.

50
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,366
What?!

51
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,133
The Division Chief told us
to go investigate.

52
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,766
If the rumor is true,
it will be a serious problem.

53
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:45,666
With a very scary punishment.

54
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,133
Punishment?!

55
00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:56,466
Izumi is such a sadist.

56
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,166
That's because you picked on Mero.

57
00:04:58,233 --> 00:04:59,433
Sorry.

58
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:04,233
I'm the only one who's allowed
to pick on Mero. Right?

59
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:07,300
So, is the rumor true?

60
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,366
Is it true?

61
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,533
Th-That's nonsense!

62
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,866
Of course we wouldn't do that.
We are Death Spirits!

63
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:15,366
I thought so.

64
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:16,966
Yup!

65
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,666
That's fine if that's the case.

66
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:21,133
By the way, where is Takuto?

67
00:05:21,966 --> 00:05:23,766
And was it Mitsuki Koyama?

68
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,066
Where is the girl you're in charge of?

69
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,466
T-Takuto is out right now.

70
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,300
He's watching over Mitsuki.

71
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,800
See, we're just doing our job.

72
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,666
Mero, why aren't you with him?

73
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:39,166
Aren't you madly in love with Takuto?

74
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:41,700
What? W-Well...

75
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:43,800
Hey, what is this?

76
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:45,900
There are so many buttons!

77
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,733
<i>The second single is</i>
<i>a very good song.</i>

78
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,100
<i>I'd love it if everybody could make it</i>
<i>to today's concert for the new single!</i>

79
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:55,966
<i>Everybody, please come to</i>
<i>Full Moon's live concert</i>

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
<i>to hear her new single</i>
<i>at Nasu Aquatic Stage</i>

81
00:05:58,033 --> 00:06:00,333
<i>- at two o'clock in the afternoon.</i>
- T-Television!

82
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:03,333
Right now,
I like TV more than Takuto!

83
00:06:03,366 --> 00:06:04,366
Oh yeah?

84
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:07,833
<i>I feel like I'm dead.</i>

85
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:11,966
Hey, hey, there's not much to
do by staying here

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,700
so let's go out and play until
Takuto comes back.

87
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,966
Okay.

88
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,300
<i>Great! I can trick them and</i>
<i>somehow get them to go back!</i>

89
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:24,233
Hey, is there anywhere you want to go?

90
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:25,100
Yeah.

91
00:06:25,366 --> 00:06:27,066
That Full Moon we just saw on TV...

92
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,766
I want to go to her
new single release concert.

93
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:35,266
<i>Why there, of all places?!</i>

94
00:06:36,033 --> 00:06:39,033
<i>A-Anyhow, I have to get</i>
<i>in touch with Takuto.</i>

95
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,866
Can you wait here a little bit?

96
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:46,566
It's the first time in a while that I'll be
going out with Izumi, so I want to dress up.

97
00:06:48,566 --> 00:06:50,166
Oh, I'm so excited.

98
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,166
What?! Izumi is here?!

99
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,200
And not only that, he came
to investigate us?!

100
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:08,266
<i>Yeah! What should I do?</i>

101
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,233
At any rate, all we can do is to
deceive him and buy some time

102
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,300
<i>until the concert for</i>
<i>the new single is over! Got it?!</i>

103
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:17,200
Okay... I'll try my best.

104
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:18,533
What do you mean, "I'll try my best"?

105
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,933
U-Umm... My make-up.

106
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,800
Yes, I tried my best with my make-up.

107
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
How do I look?

108
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:29,666
Dang it, Izumi!

109
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,300
Of course he comes
at a bad time!

110
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:33,666
I want to meet Izumi!

111
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:34,500
Huh?

112
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:37,333
Isn't he a friend of
yours and Meroko's?

113
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:38,700
I have to say hello.

114
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:40,566
No! There's no need for that!

115
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:44,333
Izumi is the most sadistic among
the Death Spirits

116
00:07:44,366 --> 00:07:46,400
and basically lives to pick on others.

117
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,733
If he learns that you not only see
the appearance of Death Spirits

118
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:51,700
but can also talk to us...

119
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:52,966
<i>Here, here.</i>

120
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,100
<i>No!</i>

121
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:59,133
No, more than that, if he finds out
that I help you by using my powers,

122
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,266
he'll immediately report it to
the Division Chief,

123
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,600
and both Meroko and I will get punished
and assigned to someone else.

124
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:06,633
What?

125
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:09,733
I'm going to hide while Izumi is around.

126
00:08:09,866 --> 00:08:10,533
Okay.

127
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:14,600
Don't worry. Just be patient until
the new single release concert is over.

128
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,733
Make sure to pretend that
you can't see us.

129
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,233
Okay, I understand.

130
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:28,666
Wow, there are so many people.

131
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:31,366
Full Moon is quite popular, huh?

132
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,200
I-I guess so.

133
00:08:34,266 --> 00:08:37,033
<i>I just have to try to get them</i>
<i>as far away as possible.</i>

134
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,266
Hey, Full Moon is over there.

135
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,133
What? Where?

136
00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:43,366
Follow me.

137
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,633
Full Moon!

138
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,966
Machi and Lisa have arrived.

139
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:49,533
Hello!

140
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,466
How are you doing, Full Moon?

141
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,033
Mero, did you mean to say "here"
when you said "over there"?

142
00:08:57,266 --> 00:08:59,033
That's strange!

143
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:03,533
<i>Takuto was saying those things,</i>

144
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:05,700
<i>but I wonder if</i>
<i>he's that scary of a person.</i>

145
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,866
Something wrong, Full Moon?

146
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:09,466
Oh? Oh, no.

147
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,733
Then, I'll begin your make-up now.

148
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,700
Yes. Thank you.

149
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:23,600
<i>Yes, I know. Pretend not to see,</i>
<i>pretend not to see.</i>

150
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:26,233
Isn't she cuter in person
than on TV?

151
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,066
Do you think so?

152
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,233
To me, Mero is so much cuter.

153
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,933
Oh... She has a nose hair sticking out.

154
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,233
Oh, is something wrong?

155
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:37,833
I-It's just a little itchy.

156
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,733
Full Moon's surprisingly funny.

157
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,833
Really.

158
00:09:45,266 --> 00:09:49,966
<i>Okay! Thank you for coming today to</i>
<i>Full Moon's second single release concert!</i>

159
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:55,000
<i>Please enjoy</i>
<i>the new world of Full Moon!</i>

160
00:09:55,366 --> 00:09:57,133
All right, it's finally show time.

161
00:09:57,366 --> 00:09:58,366
Go break a leg!

162
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,366
Yes!

163
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,666
<i>Now, it's what everybody</i>
<i>has been waiting for.</i>

164
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:04,233
<i>Here's Full Moon!</i>

165
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,300
Help me!

166
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,333
Mitsuki!

167
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,466
Hold on!

168
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:30,333
Takuto!

169
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:44,866
Are you okay?

170
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:46,133
Are you hurt?

171
00:10:48,033 --> 00:10:51,866
<i>I'm so sorry! The horse seems to</i>
<i>have been in a bad mood!</i>

172
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,766
Don't worry!
Full Moon seems to be fine.

173
00:10:55,366 --> 00:10:56,933
Thank goodness you're not hurt.

174
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,066
Yeah.

175
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,433
The knight on a white horse,
Takuto, arrives, eh?

176
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,300
Izumi! What were you thinking?!

177
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,933
Well, I guess I was just
playing around.

178
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Stop messing around!

179
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,266
Why are you so angry?

180
00:11:14,933 --> 00:11:18,200
It shouldn't matter to you
what happens to Full Moon.

181
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:25,400
Hey, since you're here, does that mean
that girl named Mitsuki is around here too?

182
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:29,800
Huh? What's wrong?

183
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,200
Where is she?
I want to meet her!

184
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,066
Th-That's...

185
00:11:37,266 --> 00:11:38,900
<i>Takuto is in trouble!</i>

186
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,566
Oh yeah!

187
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:44,066
Ms. Oshige, Dr. Wakaoji,
I have something to ask.

188
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:48,433
What?!

189
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,500
Now, let me meet Mitsuki.

190
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,700
I want to meet her!

191
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,100
Come to think of it,
isn't the name "Mitsuki"

192
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:16,800
written with the Chinese characters
meaning "full moon"?

193
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,466
That's just like "Full Moon" the singer.

194
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,233
What a funny coincidence.

195
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:25,633
Wait, Full Moon!

196
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,500
Wait!

197
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:34,366
Oh? Are they playing tag?
Looks like fun.

198
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,133
Darn it, Jonathan.

199
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:37,666
Takuto! We should go too!

200
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:38,500
Yeah.

201
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,400
Takuto! Meroko!

202
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:43,633
Change me back to Mitsuki
while we have this chance!

203
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Mitsuki!

204
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,066
Then that's...

205
00:12:55,866 --> 00:12:56,866
What?

206
00:12:57,066 --> 00:12:58,700
They're gone.

207
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:02,766
Oh well. Let's go back to Mero.

208
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:08,300
Was that long enough?

209
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:12,733
We're back.

210
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:13,766
How was it?

211
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:15,800
We lost them.

212
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Oh, yeah?

213
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:19,933
You came just in time!
I'll introduce her!

214
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:24,966
This is Mitsuki Koyama that we,
Green Onion Ramen, are in charge of.

215
00:13:27,066 --> 00:13:28,933
Oh, so this is Mitsuki?

216
00:13:29,366 --> 00:13:31,366
She's pretty cute!

217
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,733
Stop it, Izumi!

218
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:40,000
Yeah, you're going to
scare Mitsuki!

219
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:44,233
Why? It's not as if
she can see us, right?

220
00:13:44,466 --> 00:13:46,400
Huh? Oh, yeah.

221
00:13:46,466 --> 00:13:50,966
Izumi, these two probably
like this girl a lot.

222
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
I see.

223
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,966
Oh yeah,
speaking of liking, Mero,

224
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,800
how many times have you
confessed your love to Takuto?

225
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:01,133
If I recall, it was over 30 times
last time I heard.

226
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:04,000
It doesn't matter
how many times I do it!

227
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:06,433
I love that.

228
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:10,433
Laughing scornfully
while watching your face

229
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:13,933
bearing humiliation and anger
is one of my tiny joys.

230
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:18,466
I hate you!

231
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,533
You have such a short temper, Mero.

232
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:22,333
That's enough, Izumi!

233
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:27,300
Meroko is my important partner!
Stop making fun of her so much!

234
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:28,733
Takuto...

235
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:34,000
Oh? But isn't it bad for you to
be so worried about Meroko?

236
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:38,166
If you fail this time,
the Division Chief might really get angry!

237
00:14:38,633 --> 00:14:39,666
<i>Fail?</i>

238
00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:44,633
Because you haven't recovered
a single soul up to now.

239
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,033
Right, good-for-nothing Takuto?

240
00:14:48,866 --> 00:14:49,866
<i>Takuto...</i>

241
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:52,866
Takuto is a late bloomer!

242
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:55,466
He'll soon become a great Death Spirit!

243
00:14:55,666 --> 00:15:01,733
Well, I'll stop the teasing here for
the sake of my dear Mero's words.

244
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:06,200
<i>Dummy!</i>

245
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,866
Oh, by the way, Mitsuki is here
but I wonder where Full Moon is.

246
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,466
Sh-She's probably somewhere near here!

247
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,466
Mero-Mero Change!

248
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,966
Now, I have to make this work!

249
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,866
How long are they going to play tag?

250
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:36,933
Huh?

251
00:15:36,966 --> 00:15:38,066
There she is!

252
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:42,566
Gosh, how far did Ms. Oshige
and Dr. Wakaoji go?

253
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:44,633
<i>Is it Meroko?</i>

254
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:47,533
Oh, so you're Mitsuki?

255
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:48,233
Huh?

256
00:15:48,266 --> 00:15:51,000
Thank you for the flowers!
I was very happy!

257
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,166
Y-You're welcome.

258
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,466
Izumi, it's Full Moon.

259
00:15:58,133 --> 00:16:00,266
<i>Everybody,</i>
<i>just a little bit longer.</i>

260
00:16:00,466 --> 00:16:04,200
<i>Please wait a little longer.</i>
<i>Okay? Okay?</i>

261
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:07,800
Thanks for waiting! Mitsuki!
Did it work? Huh?

262
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:09,400
Huh?

263
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:14,700
- W-Why are there two Mitsukis—
- Ms. Oshige!

264
00:16:15,566 --> 00:16:19,433
M-Mitsuki, how was it?
Were you able to talk to Full Moon?

265
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:22,400
Oh? Umm... Yes, just a little bit.

266
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,133
All right, that's great.

267
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:26,233
Oh, there you guys are.

268
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,633
Both Mr. Oji and Full Moon,
please hurry.

269
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,700
We can't make the crowd
wait any longer.

270
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:31,733
I understand!

271
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,866
Tell them we'll be going
to the stage now.

272
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:34,900
Yes, sir!

273
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:36,733
Now, Full Moon.

274
00:16:36,866 --> 00:16:38,733
What?! B-But I'm...

275
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,266
Now, quick.

276
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,766
B-But...

277
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:44,733
This is great!

278
00:16:45,366 --> 00:16:49,433
<i>What are they going to do?</i>
<i>Meroko can't sing the new single.</i>

279
00:16:50,633 --> 00:16:54,100
Huh? Only one Mitsuki? Why?

280
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:55,666
That's enough!
Come back to your senses!

281
00:16:56,066 --> 00:16:58,033
<i>Hi, thanks for</i>
<i>waiting everybody.</i>

282
00:16:58,433 --> 00:17:00,533
<i>It's finally time for</i>
<i>Full Moon to come out!</i>

283
00:17:03,566 --> 00:17:04,566
Mitsuki.

284
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,500
Um, I'm Meroko.

285
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:10,466
Then the one over there
is the real Mitsuki.

286
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:13,666
Okay, keep on heading
towards the stage.

287
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,800
After that,
we'll do something about it.

288
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:16,900
But...

289
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,400
Don't worry. Trust me.

290
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:21,366
We'll change the stage direction!

291
00:17:21,966 --> 00:17:24,766
Full Moon will appear first and
we'll call her off using the horse.

292
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,500
<i>At this point,</i>
<i>I don't care what happens!</i>

293
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:35,866
What?! You brought her
up on stage?!

294
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:38,566
Yeah, we'll switch the two on stage.

295
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,000
What the—?
How are you going to do that?

296
00:17:41,233 --> 00:17:43,833
Not only is Izumi around,
there are the eyes of the crowd!

297
00:17:43,966 --> 00:17:46,133
That's why we'll change
the stage direction a little.

298
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,833
The point is to not have
that moment be visible.

299
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,133
We'll do the final trick for
the song in the beginning.

300
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:56,000
You're right, if we do that,
the top of the stage will be hidden.

301
00:17:56,666 --> 00:18:00,166
Now Takuto, I have one thing
I have to ask you to do.

302
00:18:00,533 --> 00:18:01,200
Me?

303
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,166
Yes.

304
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:03,866
Will you do it?

305
00:18:04,766 --> 00:18:05,433
Yeah!

306
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,633
<i>Full Moon, are you feeling well?</i>

307
00:18:08,766 --> 00:18:11,033
<i>Yes, I'm completely fine!</i>

308
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:12,066
I'm so glad!

309
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,466
Thanks!

310
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,966
<i>Your new single really captures</i>
<i>your essence.</i>

311
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,500
<i>Thank you!</i>

312
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:20,533
<i>- I did my best!</i>
- She looks distressed. This is great.

313
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,800
<i>Then Full Moon,</i>
<i>please let us hear the song!</i>

314
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:24,833
<i>Sure.</i>

315
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,466
All right, let the emcee retire stage left.

316
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:34,033
The song will begin with my signal.
Mitsuki, you got it?

317
00:18:34,266 --> 00:18:34,933
Yes!

318
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:39,000
All right. Now, let's begin!

319
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,033
<i>Now everybody,</i>
<i>please listen to "Eternal Snow."</i>

320
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:45,600
- Huh?
-She's so cute!

321
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,166
<i>Mitsuki?</i>

322
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:50,500
What are they trying to do?

323
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:52,200
They won't be able to do a thing.

324
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,133
Now!

325
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:07,333
I can't see!

326
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:10,733
W-What is this?!

327
00:19:10,766 --> 00:19:12,066
Meroko! Now, while we
have the chance!

328
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,766
Huh?

329
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,666
Takuto!

330
00:19:41,033 --> 00:19:42,533
Meroko! Hurry!

331
00:19:42,566 --> 00:19:43,233
Yeah!

332
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:46,100
Done!

333
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,300
Darn, I can't see a thing.

334
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:19,233
<i>How long...has it been...</i>
<i>since I fell in love with you...</i>

335
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:28,833
<i>My feelings keep</i>
<i>getting stronger...</i>

336
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:31,233
I'm so tired!

337
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:32,300
Good work!

338
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:39,000
Umm... Hey, Izumi?

339
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,533
Sorry, sorry, I might have played
around too much.

340
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:44,400
What?

341
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,933
Well, Full Moon is a good singer.

342
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,533
I understand why you want
to support her, Takuto.

343
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,833
I was able to meet Mitsuki, and there seems
to be nothing suspicious either, so...

344
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:57,466
What?! Then...

345
00:20:57,933 --> 00:20:59,833
It's about time we go home.

346
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,000
It was fun, Mero!

347
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:07,800
See you later!

348
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:15,833
Aren't you glad they
didn't find out, Takuto?

349
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:16,533
Yeah...

350
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,900
<i>I hope that's the case.</i>

351
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:27,066
Izumi, should we report it
to the Division Chief?

352
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:30,800
No. For now, I'll be silent about it.

353
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,200
Becoming a friend with
a human child like that.

354
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,666
That's why you'll
always be no good.

355
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,100
Before long, I'll make you
understand that Mero is mine.

356
00:23:18,766 --> 00:23:21,266
Meroko, you said she has
a guest from America?

357
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,933
Who is it?
Could it be Eichi?!

358
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:27,600
No, it's not! It's Ms. Kazumi,
her teacher from the orphanage.

359
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,166
I see.

360
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,033
But Ms. Kazumi's married and
lives in America now!

361
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,700
She might know something about Eichi!

362
00:23:36,233 --> 00:23:39,333
I-I'm just worried about
our assignment as Death Spirits.

363
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:40,966
It's not like I'm jealous.

364
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:44,766
Next time on Full Moon:
"Someone Who Might
Know Where Eichi Is"

365
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:46,033
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
