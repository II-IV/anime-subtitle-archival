00:00:05,666 --> 00:00:08,700
Full Moon has a show at
a university's school festival.

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,200
But there are some weirdos
among the students

3
00:00:12,233 --> 00:00:14,233
that put her in some
dangerous situations!

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,133
Takuto thinks fast and
turns into his human form

5
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:19,933
to act as Mitsuki's bodyguard,
so nothing goes wrong, but...

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,366
Why are you always all about Mitsuki?!
You're mine, Takuto!

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,866
So, I wonder what's
going to happen today...

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,700
Got that?

9
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:34,700
Yes.

10
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,966
Good job today!

11
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,100
- Good job!
- Good job!

12
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,733
Oh, here she comes!

13
00:02:17,866 --> 00:02:18,866
Sorry to keep you waiting!

14
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:20,866
Are all you done?
Let's hurry and go here!

15
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,900
I heard it's famous for
its super spicy ramen!

16
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:25,666
I would rather go to this Taiyaki place.

17
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,000
Sure, I can't eat unless
you go with me anyway.

18
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:32,200
Oh yeah! How about
going to both places!

19
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:33,233
How about it, Takuto?

20
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:33,933
Okay, okay.

21
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,366
Go to both places?

22
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:38,666
Say, I haven't seen Madoka lately.

23
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:40,700
Madoka? Who's that?

24
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:42,633
Oh no, did you forget her?

25
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:47,366
That one that competed with Full Moon
to release a CD... Madoka Wakamatsu.

26
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:49,800
Oh, right, right!

27
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:52,400
I wonder what she's up to?
We haven't heard anything about her.

28
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,866
Maybe she's retiring.

29
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:55,133
Maybe.

30
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
<i>Retiring?</i>

31
00:03:04,633 --> 00:03:06,533
Huh? Madoka Wakamatsu?

32
00:03:07,066 --> 00:03:09,466
Yes, I wonder what she's
been doing since then.

33
00:03:10,633 --> 00:03:11,633
Is it bothering you?

34
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:14,033
Well...yes.

35
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:18,933
I understand how you feel, but it's not
something you should be worried about.

36
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:23,400
Even if something
like that happened.

37
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:33,433
I'm a bit shocked that Ms. Oshige
said such a cold thing.

38
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:37,600
Really? I think that's logical.

39
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:40,466
Even you're saying that?

40
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:44,466
Well, it won't do much to worry, right?

41
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:46,566
Well... That's true, but...

42
00:03:46,766 --> 00:03:49,733
Yeah. Why are you even
worrying about her

43
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:51,666
after she did all sorts of
mean things to you?

44
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,500
Yeah, you're right.

45
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,266
<i>But...</i>

46
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,533
<i>I can't stop worrying about</i>
<i>what happened to her.</i>

47
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,900
Oh, over there!

48
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,700
Wow, it's so crowded!

49
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:19,700
They must really be good!

50
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,166
Don't they look like they
are from the industry?

51
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:24,200
I can't take this anymore!

52
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,133
Wait, Madoka!

53
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:29,700
Wait!

54
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:31,933
<i>Madoka!</i>

55
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:36,333
You have to go back, Madoka.

56
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,233
But I can't stand spicy things!
I can't eat that!

57
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,366
I don't know what
your previous manager was like,

58
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,766
but I won't let you be so selfish!

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Whatever!

60
00:04:47,366 --> 00:04:50,266
Ms. Sasaki would've never
made me do this kind of job!

61
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,000
She took better care
of me as a talent!

62
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:54,233
Madoka...

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,200
Well, at least she hasn't retired.

64
00:04:57,233 --> 00:04:59,200
Looks like she has
a new manager as well.

65
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:00,533
She's reporting, huh?

66
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:04,033
No fair! She gets to eat
that super spicy ramen for free!

67
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:07,633
Ms. Imamura,
we are going to take a break now.

68
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:10,433
All right.
I'm very sorry.

69
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,633
What are you doing?
Did you come to eat ramen?

70
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:16,100
Huh? Oh...

71
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,266
Or, I don't suppose you're
Madoka Wakamatsu's fan?

72
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:22,700
No, you can't be, right?
That ex-idol on the downgrade.

73
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:23,866
D-Downgrade?

74
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:26,133
You can call it going downhill too.

75
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:34,166
Listen, Madoka.
Ms. Sasaki didn't care about you.

76
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:36,766
She was just spoiling you.

77
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:40,033
Understood? Now go back to work.

78
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,233
I can't take this anymore.

79
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:44,300
What?

80
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:46,300
I quit!

81
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:47,433
Madoka?!

82
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,800
I don't want to be doing
these kinds of worthless jobs.

83
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,733
Don't say such nonsense!

84
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,466
Bye.

85
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,766
Madoka!
Come back, Madoka.

86
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,466
No.

87
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,866
I don't want to do it anymore,
so I won't go back!

88
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:04,033
Where do you think you're going?

89
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Goodbye!

90
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,733
Madoka, you are coming back here!

91
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:14,000
Do you hear me?
You are coming back!

92
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,466
What the heck?

93
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,900
Can't at least one person
come running after me?

94
00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:02,066
What is it?!
What do you want from me?

95
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:03,733
U-Umm...

96
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,133
Hey, are you okay?

97
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,800
You shouldn't have
pushed yourself that much.

98
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:15,233
I-I'm all right.

99
00:08:15,433 --> 00:08:16,100
Hey...

100
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,266
Are you all right?
Are you not feeling well?

101
00:08:32,766 --> 00:08:34,800
Wow, the pizza is so red.

102
00:08:34,966 --> 00:08:37,900
Didn't she say she
couldn't stand spicy food?

103
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,700
Here, eat, eat!

104
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:41,733
Yeah.

105
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:45,733
So huge.

106
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,766
Oh, any normal idol would eat that.

107
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,900
Really?!

108
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:52,633
Is that so?

109
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,233
Oh yeah, you didn't know?

110
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:57,466
How nice!

111
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,866
I didn't know that.

112
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:02,800
Why are you being so clueless?
You're an idol too, aren't you?

113
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:03,833
Oh, that's right.

114
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:07,800
- Did you say something?
- Oh, no!

115
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:14,233
You're a bit strange.
So, what were you talking about?

116
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,166
What?

117
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:18,633
You were talking with the staff, right?
At the ramen shop.

118
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:21,300
So, what were you talking about?

119
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:24,133
Well... Umm... That's...

120
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:28,066
<i>I don't suppose you're</i>
<i>Madoka Wakamatsu's fan?</i>

121
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:31,366
<i>No, you can't be, right?</i>
<i>That ex-idol on the downgrade.</i>

122
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,066
<i>What?</i>

123
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,100
<i>You can call it</i>
<i>going downhill too.</i>

124
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,800
<i>I can't tell her such</i>
<i>a horrible thing.</i>

125
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:44,400
No, nothing out of the ordinary.

126
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,066
I'll determine if it's out
of the ordinary or not.

127
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,600
So just tell me!

128
00:09:49,766 --> 00:09:50,866
Umm...

129
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,966
We were just saying what
a wonderful person you are, Madoka.

130
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,766
Oh, really? Of course.
Some people can actually see that.

131
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,533
And you?

132
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:02,400
Huh?

133
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,500
What do you mean, "huh?"
Aren't you my fan?

134
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,033
Tell her no. Just tell her clearly.

135
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,700
Yeah, or else this woman
will get carried away again.

136
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,666
Don't hesitate to tell me the truth.

137
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:16,233
Yes...that's right.

138
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,800
Hey, don't be idiotic now.

139
00:10:19,966 --> 00:10:24,966
Yeah, women like her only take things
the way they want to!

140
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:27,700
Yeah! I knew it!

141
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:30,266
You see?

142
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:32,866
So, you must be like,
"oh my god,"

143
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,833
after meeting your idol
Madoka Wakamatsu, right?

144
00:10:39,466 --> 00:10:41,700
Miss, I'm so sorry!

145
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:46,033
Sorry.

146
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:05,733
Here you go.

147
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,133
Thank you.

148
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:13,033
It's delicious!

149
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,833
That's an outfit I wore for
a role when I as a kid.

150
00:11:17,966 --> 00:11:19,233
I'm glad it fits.

151
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,566
Thank you so much for this.

152
00:11:20,766 --> 00:11:24,200
No, no problem.
But that was terrible.

153
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,166
Yes.

154
00:11:25,266 --> 00:11:27,400
You're the one who drenched her!

155
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:30,166
Oh? A message?

156
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:31,633
Who could it be?

157
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:36,266
<i>Madoka, it's your mother.</i>
<i>How are you?</i>

158
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,866
<i>You haven't called in so long,</i>
<i>I started worrying. How is work going?</i>

159
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,300
<i>We got a bunch of persimmons,</i>
<i>so I'll send some to you.</i>

160
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:46,100
<i>I'll send some to</i>
<i>your new manager as well.</i>

161
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,766
<i>Please call me sometime.</i>

162
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:58,566
<i>Hello. Delivery!</i>

163
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,666
Oh, okay.

164
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,400
Here we go.

165
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,866
Wow, so many persimmons!

166
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,566
Wanna try them?

167
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,566
Sure.

168
00:12:07,966 --> 00:12:09,100
Thank you!

169
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:17,533
These persimmons your mother
sent are so delicious.

170
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:18,500
Really?

171
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:21,833
Madoka...

172
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,533
Hmm?

173
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,500
What are you going to do now?

174
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,866
Dashing out in the middle of work...

175
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:34,866
It's just that,
I want to become an idol.

176
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,366
I wanna wear pretty dresses
and have the spotlight on me.

177
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:42,033
And have many fans,
and people who copy me.

178
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,533
And I wanna always have
the attention of the media.

179
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,766
After running away from the workplace,
what the heck is she talking about?

180
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,566
She thinks being a singer is easy.

181
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:53,566
Recently, I've been thinking maybe
it's better to be an actress than a singer.

182
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,200
What do you think?
Wouldn't I make a great actress?

183
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:56,900
She thinks being
an actress is easy too!

184
00:12:56,966 --> 00:12:58,933
How audacious of her!

185
00:12:59,266 --> 00:13:00,566
So singing...

186
00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:02,900
So you aren't going to sing anymore?

187
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,166
I'm done singing.

188
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,700
Oh, Gu!

189
00:13:11,566 --> 00:13:13,300
You know Gu?

190
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,800
Oh, no, I've only seen you
holding him in a magazine.

191
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:21,966
Huh? What?

192
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:26,033
Does he see us?

193
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:27,066
That can't be.

194
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,233
You really are my fan, aren't you?

195
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:30,966
No!

196
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,966
- I'm impressed. Make yourself at home.
- Hey! Meroko!

197
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,666
Y-Yes.

198
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:37,066
Gu!

199
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,066
Can you be quiet please?

200
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,633
I'm saved.

201
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,533
What a shrewd pig.

202
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,200
These videos are so valuable now!

203
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,400
Madoka... You're so beautiful.

204
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,566
Oh? R-Really?

205
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:11,200
It's a little embarrassing
when people remind me.

206
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:36,066
What are you doing?!

207
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,100
Madoka?

208
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:49,766
Yeah! This is the song that I competed
against Full Moon with and lost.

209
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,833
Doesn't it amuse you to hear it?

210
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:52,800
But...

211
00:14:55,866 --> 00:14:57,133
Sorry for raising my voice.

212
00:14:58,133 --> 00:15:01,500
Oh, yeah, you must be thirsty, right?
I'll go buy something.

213
00:15:02,766 --> 00:15:03,766
Madoka!

214
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,333
Takuto!

215
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,800
Sorry, I have to go after Madoka.

216
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:09,833
Wait!

217
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,666
Meroko is going after her.
Read this before you go.

218
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:17,833
What's this?

219
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:24,400
"September 18th.
A new song. Such a wonderful song."

220
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,500
"I'm so lucky to be able to
sing this as my debut song."

221
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:29,166
Takuto, is this...

222
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:37,733
"I want to study a lot of things to
get a better image for this song."

223
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:41,200
<i>Mr. Takasu disapproved of</i>
<i>my performance today.</i>

224
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,166
<i>But Mr. Takasu is</i>
<i>my most reliable producer.</i>

225
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:51,233
<i>He scolds me because he cares about me.</i>
<i>I have to meet his expectations.</i>

226
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:57,333
<i>November 30th.</i>
<i>I can't hit the high notes well.</i>

227
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,766
<i>I should've done my vocal</i>
<i>exercises more thoroughly.</i>

228
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
<i>I'm regretting that.</i>

229
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,366
Madoka, you cared about
"Eternal Snow" so much.

230
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:20,566
I'm so frustrated.
So frustrated! So frustrated.

231
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,166
What do I do?
Just what can I do?

232
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:31,866
Now, everything is over.

233
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,766
What?

234
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:08,700
Is it funny...that I'm crying?

235
00:17:10,533 --> 00:17:14,366
Why don't you sing "Eternal Snow"?

236
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,533
I want to sing it too!

237
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,666
But I can't anymore!

238
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,633
After all, I've lost.
I lost to myself!

239
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:27,233
I didn't lose to Full Moon.

240
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,800
That's right.
I didn't lose to Full Moon.

241
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:37,333
<i>You can't believe in me,</i>
<i>can you?</i>

242
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,166
<i>Well...</i>

243
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:41,266
<i>I believed in you.</i>

244
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:45,800
<i>I believed in your power.</i>

245
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,433
Madoka... Please sing.

246
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:10,333
You said a moment ago that
you wanted to sing, right?

247
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,200
I want to hear your song too!

248
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,300
My song?

249
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:18,633
I think...

250
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,833
that everyone
has a unique song.

251
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,200
2There's a song for Full Moon.

252
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,300
But I think that there's also
a song that only you can sing.

253
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,533
I want to hear your song.

254
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:43,233
<i>You better think again</i>
<i>why you want to sing.</i>

255
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:46,733
<i>That's all I can say.</i>

256
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:51,633
That's what he meant.

257
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:59,500
I have a feeling that once I hear your song,
I'll like you even more!

258
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:01,766
What a statement.

259
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:04,600
But who on earth are you?

260
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:08,366
I'm one of your fans.

261
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
I see.

262
00:19:11,766 --> 00:19:14,400
But there might be no place
to go back to anymore.

263
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:16,233
That's not true!

264
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,600
There must be lots of people
waiting for you!

265
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You think so?

266
00:19:21,033 --> 00:19:22,033
Yes!

267
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:24,000
Everybody is waiting for you!

268
00:19:24,266 --> 00:19:25,933
I'm sure they're waiting! I'm sure.

269
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,633
It's so late,
I'm sure no one is still waiting.

270
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,333
Ms. Imamura?

271
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,333
Ms. Imamura!

272
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,266
Madoka?

273
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:49,866
You came back.

274
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:52,566
I'm sorry.

275
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:55,600
It's all right.
I'm so glad you came back.

276
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:57,133
Ms. Imamura...

277
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:58,366
Yes?

278
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,100
I want to sing!

279
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,533
I was waiting for you to say that.

280
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:11,766
You had been running away.
You were scared of singing.

281
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:15,466
But it won't do you any good to run away.

282
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,866
That's why I was strict with you,
believing that one day,

283
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,533
you would tell me
that you wanted to sing.

284
00:20:22,633 --> 00:20:26,633
I had no idea. I'm sorry.

285
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:28,833
I'm sorry!

286
00:20:30,366 --> 00:20:32,800
Now, let's go to Mr. Takasu's,
shall we?

287
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:38,466
Mr. Takasu must be
waiting for you too.

288
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:43,633
Yes!

289
00:20:49,366 --> 00:20:51,933
And today's show's director is...

290
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:53,833
Oh, Madoka!

291
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,600
Madoka! Good morning!

292
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,566
I've been wanting to
tell you this for a while.

293
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:04,333
Yes?

294
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,000
All this time, I thought of you as
an inept idol with just a pretty face.

295
00:21:09,033 --> 00:21:09,700
Huh?

296
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:13,166
But maybe you are pretty
talented as a singer.

297
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,000
That's what I started
to think recently!

298
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,433
But I will not lose to you,
no matter what!

299
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,666
What was that?

300
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,833
Well, I guess that's
her way of greeting you.

301
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:31,933
Greeting me?

302
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,733
It means she acknowledges you!

303
00:21:34,866 --> 00:21:38,033
She's so insincere.
Though, who am I to say this?

304
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:41,633
Madoka...

305
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:23,966
Oh no, Takuto! Looks like Mitsuki's illness
has suddenly gotten worse!

306
00:23:24,066 --> 00:23:26,666
What?! Have you
contacted that doctor?!

307
00:23:26,866 --> 00:23:31,400
Well... Just when we need Dr. Wakaoji,
we can't get a hold of him!

308
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,566
Jeez! Where is he
at such a critical time?!

309
00:23:34,733 --> 00:23:38,066
If we don't do something,
they will force her to get the operation!

310
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,266
Next time on Full Moon:
"The Illness Advances."

311
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,100
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
