1
00:00:05,933 --> 00:00:08,500
What?! Eichi is at Narita Airport?

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,166
Just before the Fantasia
Music Festival's rehearsal,

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,800
Mitsuki receives another
fake email from Izumi.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,166
Mitsuki is waiting at the airport,
and Takuto decides to tell her the truth.

5
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:20,500
But Mitsuki isn't discouraged
by the news,

6
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:22,666
and she goes on to win
the Best New Singer Award!

7
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:24,300
You did great, Mitsuki!

8
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:28,033
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

9
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:33,666
Got that?

10
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:34,733
Yes.

11
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,666
Good morning.

12
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,900
Morning!

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,400
Congratulations on
the Best New Singer Award!

14
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:26,900
Thank you very much!

15
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:33,166
Thanks to the award, I get to go to America.
I'm so happy I can't stand it!

16
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,133
How nice! Share a little bit
of your happiness with me!

17
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:39,800
Well, Ms. Oda, why don't you come
to the Christmas party?

18
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,466
We're talking about doing it at
Ms. Oshige's house on Christmas Eve.

19
00:02:44,566 --> 00:02:47,900
A Christmas party? It kind of sounds like
an elementary school kid's way of saying it.

20
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:49,900
What? Yeah, maybe.

21
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,933
<i>But I have work</i>
<i>on Christmas Eve.</i>

22
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:55,800
<i>Aww, that's too bad!</i>

23
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:58,266
Seems like she's super excited.

24
00:02:58,466 --> 00:03:01,100
She's so close to finding out
where Eichi is.

25
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,333
She's so happy she
can't contain herself.

26
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,166
<i>Well, shall we start</i>
<i>recording soon?</i>

27
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:06,033
Sure!

28
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:09,733
Okay, this program is going to
be aired on Christmas Eve,

29
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:12,266
so let's do this
like it's the 24th.

30
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:13,033
Okay!

31
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:20,266
Hello, everyone! Merry Christmas!
Well, our guest tonight is...

32
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,533
Full Moon! Merry Christmas!

33
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,966
Ms. Oshige and me...

34
00:03:34,466 --> 00:03:36,466
Wakana, Tomoe...

35
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:39,666
There they are!

36
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,766
Good morning!

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh, morning!

38
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:42,700
Morning.

39
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:45,900
Hey Kumi, Emi, do you have
plans on Christmas Eve?

40
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:47,400
No, why?

41
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,733
I'm going to have a Christmas party
with everybody.

42
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:51,000
- A Christmas party?!
- A Christmas party?!

43
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,133
Yeah! Do you two
wanna come?

44
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,866
We'll decorate the door with a wreath,
exchange presents and stuff.

45
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,866
It'll definitely be fun!

46
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,666
Yeah, sounds good.

47
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,633
And it's our last Christmas as
elementary school students!

48
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,566
Yep! Let's all have fun together.

49
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:16,366
So look here, you do this...

50
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:18,533
Then this, then this...

51
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,100
You put a ribbon on it...

52
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,833
And the wreath is complete!

53
00:04:22,633 --> 00:04:25,333
- The Forest Friends Play!
- The Forest Friends Play!

54
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,000
At Christmas, hanging a wreath on the door
or a wall is supposed to attract happiness.

55
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,066
Everyone in front of the TV,

56
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,433
hang a wreath on the door
for Christmas, and let's be happy!

57
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,933
We Death Spirits don't really have
anything to do with Christmas though.

58
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:46,833
No way! Death Spirits want to be
happy on Christmas too!

59
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,533
Mitsuki, you're so good.

60
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:52,300
Before I moved in with my grandma,
I made them every year.

61
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:54,433
Oh, you mean...

62
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,800
They bring back special memories
you made with Eichi?!

63
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:58,500
What?!

64
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,066
<i>It's a beautiful wreath, Mitsuki.</i>

65
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:09,966
<i>If the wreath is made</i>
<i>by you, Mitsuki,</i>

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,233
<i>I feel like it's really going to</i>
<i>bring me happiness.</i>

67
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:19,000
<i>I hope that Eichi and me,</i>
<i>and everyone will find happiness.</i>

68
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:26,866
You're so lucky, Mitsuki!

69
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:27,733
What?

70
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:29,533
Oh, I'm jealous!

71
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:30,566
Yeah, yeah.

72
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:35,600
Hey, I know, how about if we invite boys
for Christmas? Okay, Kumi?

73
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:36,333
What?!

74
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,533
It'll be your chance!

75
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:45,933
Then, is that okay?

76
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:47,500
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

77
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:51,933
Kumi, Wakana...

78
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:54,000
Emi, and then...

79
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:56,533
Yeah, yeah, it doesn't matter
how many people,

80
00:05:56,566 --> 00:05:58,600
so invite everyone
and we'll party!

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,066
Okay.

82
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:02,766
But I wonder if it's okay
to invite classmates.

83
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,233
That's right, how will you
explain Ms. Oshige.

84
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:11,066
That's no problem.
You can tell them that I'm like a big sister.

85
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:13,600
"Big sister," really?

86
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:15,366
I don't think you'd pass.

87
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,433
What are you two saying!

88
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,800
That's why I said "like"
a big sister. Jeez!

89
00:06:25,433 --> 00:06:28,800
My CD is finally done.

90
00:06:29,366 --> 00:06:33,966
Mr. Takasu wanted to release
your CD within the year,

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,900
and he did everything possible
to make it happen.

92
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,366
The release date is towards
the very end of the year...December 24th.

93
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,533
December 24th?

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,333
Don't get spoiled by
your Christmas present.

95
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:52,133
It's a humble celebration for
the new Madoka Wakamatsu

96
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,966
who could finally get
her start as a singer.

97
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:58,333
Thank you so much.

98
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:03,200
I see. A Christmas party, huh?

99
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,933
Dr. Wakaoji, you should come too.

100
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:08,500
Sorry, I have to work that day.

101
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:09,700
What?!

102
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,166
But if I can go home early,
I'll swing by.

103
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,866
Okay!

104
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,500
<i>So, you saw it, right?</i>

105
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,900
<i>Yes, the husband came</i>
<i>down from the second floor</i>

106
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:24,833
<i>and said that</i>
<i>he wanted coffee.</i>

107
00:07:24,866 --> 00:07:27,266
<i>So I thought I'd make it, but the wife said</i>
<i>she would make it, which she rarely does.</i>

108
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,300
Ms. Tanaka...

109
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,333
Yes?

110
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:34,433
Wow! Fuyuko Komaki's
Christmas Dinner Show?!

111
00:07:34,966 --> 00:07:37,433
It's a little early,
but it's a Christmas present.

112
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:43,033
Th-Thank you very much!
I can't believe you were able to get a ticket.

113
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,966
I got it from Ms. Oshige.
But I can't go.

114
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,300
Oh, I see.

115
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:52,833
But it's such a nice thing!
It's too much! Oh, I know!

116
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:59,233
Here, this is a gift in return.

117
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:00,333
A radio?

118
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,133
I won it in a lottery when
I was out shopping.

119
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,500
I already have a radio.

120
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,733
This will be a secret from
your grandmother!

121
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,666
I am so happy,
I am so happy!

122
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:20,900
Oh, yes! I have to listen to all of
Fuyuko Komaki's CDs again.

123
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:24,700
<i>Well then, the fax theme</i>
<i>for this evening is,</i>

124
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:28,266
<i>"Christmas is almost here!</i>
<i>What do you want for a present?!"</i>

125
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,600
I'm giving my grandma a knit shawl.

126
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:36,633
A hand knit present, huh?
You put so much into it, Mitsuki.

127
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:40,900
Think of your body...
and don't overdo it.

128
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:47,866
Hey, are there Christmas presents
in the world of Death Spirits?

129
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:50,033
It's not that there aren't, but...

130
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,900
Well, why don't you knit
a present for Takuto too?

131
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,800
Oh, are you not good at knitting?

132
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:01,500
No, but...is it okay?

133
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,366
What?

134
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:06,833
No... Umm... You're right!
It's Christmas!

135
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:09,133
Yes, let's all be happy!

136
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:12,366
I want to be happy too.

137
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:17,033
On Christmas Eve, I'm going to give Takuto
a present and confess my love!

138
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:18,200
Yeah!

139
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,200
<i>And now one song.</i>

140
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,366
<i>This song will be released</i>
<i>on December 24th,</i>

141
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,833
<i>and it is Madoka Wakamatsu's</i>
<i>debut single.</i>

142
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:31,833
<i>It's a cover of</i>
<i>a Route L song,</i>

143
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:34,566
<i>and it was a hot topic when</i>
<i>she competed with Full Moon.</i>

144
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,800
<i>It's a little bit late,</i>
<i>but it's finally on sale.</i>

145
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,833
<i>Her version is more rhythmic.</i>

146
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:44,333
<i>If you give this to the person you like</i>
<i>for Christmas, I'm sure things will go well!</i>

147
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,866
<i>Here is Madoka Wakamtsu's,</i>
<i>"Eternal Snow"!</i>

148
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:54,800
<i>How long has it been</i>
<i>since I fell in love with you?</i>

149
00:09:55,266 --> 00:10:01,866
<i>- My feelings keep getting stronger...</i>
- Madoka... That's great.

150
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:09,233
<i>I wonder if you can notice them.</i>

151
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:16,600
<i>Even though I've</i>
<i>never mentioned it.</i>

152
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:23,533
<i>They're silent like the snow,</i>

153
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,433
<i>but they keep building up.</i>

154
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:33,933
<i>Hold me tight,</i>

155
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:43,000
<i>if loving someone</i>
<i>was going to feel like this</i>

156
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,000
<i>I wish I never found out</i>
<i>about love.</i>

157
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:48,033
<i>I love you.</i>

158
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:52,200
<i>My tears won't stop.</i>

159
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:54,300
<i>If this is how it's going to be...</i>

160
00:10:54,333 --> 00:11:03,533
<i>It would have been better...</i>
<i>I wish I had never met you!</i>

161
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,700
Hey, Meroko.

162
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:06,700
Hmm?

163
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:11,200
Let's keep this a secret from Takuto until
Christmas Eve and surprise him, okay?

164
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:12,700
Yeah!

165
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:30,700
<i>I'm sure that Christmas</i>
<i>this year is going to be lovely.</i>

166
00:11:51,966 --> 00:11:53,500
Okay, I'll see you on the 24th!

167
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,200
At four o'clock in front of
the shopping mall, right?

168
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:57,133
Yeah!

169
00:11:57,166 --> 00:12:00,066
Mitsuki, Kumi invited Machida too!

170
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,866
Really?!

171
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:02,900
Yeah.

172
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,200
Wow! That's great!

173
00:12:06,066 --> 00:12:07,266
Okay, bye!

174
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:08,533
- Bye!
- Bye!

175
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:13,633
What's up with that Meroko lately?

176
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
What do you mean?

177
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,800
Both yesterday and today,
she said, "I'm sleepy"

178
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,600
and wouldn't even come with you.

179
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,700
I'm sure that she's doing something
in the middle of the night.

180
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:25,633
Girls have a lot of things to do.

181
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:26,733
Like what?

182
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,700
Just a lot of things...

183
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,166
Yep, I'm sure that Grandma will
be happy to receive this.

184
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,333
Oh, you're so lucky, Mitsuki.

185
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,166
I haven't even scratched
the surface of my scarf.

186
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,866
Well, if it's come to this,
I'll use my powers!

187
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,133
If you don't knit it all
with your own hands,

188
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,266
you won't be able to convey
your feelings to Takuto.

189
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,300
What are you talking about
in the middle of the night?

190
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,000
Whoa! Nothing!

191
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,866
Th-That's right.

192
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's nothing.

193
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:09,900
It's okay to be excited for Christmas,
but keep it in check.

194
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,566
- Okay!
- Okay!

195
00:13:24,866 --> 00:13:25,866
Grandma?

196
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,800
You could at least answer!

197
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:30,500
Meroko!

198
00:13:31,066 --> 00:13:32,866
Umm... Grandma...

199
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,633
I've made plans with my friends today.
I'll come home before it gets too late.

200
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,500
May I go—

201
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:42,133
Do as you like.

202
00:13:42,866 --> 00:13:45,033
Th-Thank you!

203
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,366
Well, I'm off!

204
00:14:04,866 --> 00:14:06,333
Oh, she's here!

205
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,866
Mitsuki!

206
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,900
Everyone!

207
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,900
Wow...

208
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:18,433
It's a beautiful tree, isn't it?

209
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:21,533
I'm sure it's even more
beautiful in the evening.

210
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,666
It's romantic.

211
00:14:24,566 --> 00:14:27,366
I've decided to confess to
Takuto over there!

212
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,500
Oh, I think that will be lovely.

213
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:31,566
What are you whispering about?

214
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:33,566
Oh, nothing!

215
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,300
It's a secret.

216
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:36,433
Huh?

217
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:38,233
What is it with those two?

218
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,100
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

219
00:17:10,633 --> 00:17:12,666
Hey, what happened to everyone?

220
00:17:16,266 --> 00:17:17,966
Umm... Machida...

221
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:24,766
Umm...

222
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:32,766
- Please go out with me!
- Please go out with me!

223
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,266
- Yay!
- Yay!

224
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,133
Come to think of it, where is Meroko?

225
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,966
Oh, Takuto.
You have something in your pocket.

226
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:46,733
Huh?

227
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,766
So I'm supposed to clean
this up by myself?

228
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:56,533
Yes?

229
00:17:58,133 --> 00:18:00,833
Oh, Dr. Wakaoji...

230
00:18:01,066 --> 00:18:02,133
Merry Christmas.

231
00:18:02,633 --> 00:18:05,266
Huh? Is it all over?

232
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:06,833
No, no.

233
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:10,033
There's still some food left over,
so let's make a toast!

234
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:21,700
I'LL BE WAITING AT
THE TOP OF THE TREE
IN THE SHOPPING MALL PLAZA.
—MEROKO

235
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:26,133
Meroko.

236
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:30,966
What is this?
You could've just told me this.

237
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,500
But...

238
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,733
I wanted to give this to you
in front of this tree.

239
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,500
You... Is this what you've been
sneaking around to do lately?

240
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,700
It's Christmas! It's the first Christmas
since Green Onion Ramen was formed.

241
00:18:56,766 --> 00:18:59,433
Mitsuki taught me,
and I knit it the best that I could.

242
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,533
What?

243
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:02,400
<i>She taught you?</i>

244
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:10,100
Takuto... I've been given the cold shoulder
many times, but I'll keep confessing.

245
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:14,300
Takuto, I really like you.

246
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:16,400
What?

247
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:19,400
Oh, I understand.

248
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,266
You just...

249
00:19:22,566 --> 00:19:24,266
I've confessed 58 times,

250
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,566
and this is the first time you didn't let it
go in one ear and out the other.

251
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,966
W-Well, it's the first Christmas
since we've met.

252
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,000
So...

253
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:36,600
D-Don't get the wrong idea.
I don't especially like anyone...

254
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:45,666
I'm unsure of...my feelings.

255
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,566
That's okay.

256
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:56,366
Compared to the past,
this is major progress. I'm satisfied.

257
00:19:57,866 --> 00:19:58,866
This is great.

258
00:20:03,366 --> 00:20:04,433
H-Hey!

259
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:07,666
Wrap this around yourself too.

260
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,400
Aww, Takuto!

261
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:11,700
I know, I know.

262
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:13,500
Stop crying.

263
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,400
Yay!

264
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:25,300
- Yahoo! Jingle, jingle...
- Hmm, 58 times, huh?

265
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:28,033
I let it go in one ear and
out the other 83 times.

266
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:33,233
Who cares about that this evening?
Merry Christmas, everyone!

267
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,833
Okay, smile, smile!

268
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,466
Huh? I don't understand
how to work the flash!

269
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,866
What are you doing? C'mon!

270
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,200
Actually, I have a present for
the two of you as well.

271
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:47,766
Here you go.

272
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,733
It's cute!

273
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:52,233
Mitsuki, you made these for us?

274
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
Hey Takuto!

275
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:55,700
Yeah!

276
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:56,700
Okay!

277
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,800
Green Onion Ramen returns the favor!

278
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:11,933
It's snowing!

279
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,300
Yeah!

280
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:15,133
Wow, so pretty!

281
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:23,233
<i>Hello, everyone! Merry Christmas!</i>
<i>Well, our guest tonight is...</i>

282
00:21:23,566 --> 00:21:26,200
<i>Full Moon!</i>
<i>Merry Christmas, everyone!</i>

283
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:28,366
<i>- Thanks for joining us tonight.</i>
<i>- Thanks you for having me!</i>

284
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,666
<i>Well, why don't we start with the song?</i>
<i>Will you introduce it for us?</i>

285
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,566
<i>Sure!</i>

286
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,666
<i>From the bottom of my heart,</i>
<i>I hope you all have a wonderful Christmas.</i>

287
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,000
<i>This is Full Moon,</i>
<i>and here is my song, "Eternal Snow."</i>

288
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:21,466
Oh no! This is bad!

289
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,566
I know!

290
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,000
We were so caught up in the excitement
over the Best New Singer Award

291
00:23:24,033 --> 00:23:25,966
that we forgot to think about
her grandmother!

292
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:29,266
Isn't there some way to convince her
to let her go to America?

293
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,533
There's no way!

294
00:23:30,633 --> 00:23:34,300
We have to keep it a secret that
it's the prize for winning the award!

295
00:23:34,633 --> 00:23:35,633
Oh, more bad news!

296
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:37,666
She got in a fight with
her grandmother!

297
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:43,000
Next time on Full Moon:
"Grandma's Past"

298
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:44,533
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
