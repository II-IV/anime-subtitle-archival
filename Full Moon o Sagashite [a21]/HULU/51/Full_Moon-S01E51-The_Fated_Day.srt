1
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,466
<i>Testing, testing.</i>

2
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:28,200
<i>Mic check, mic check.</i>

3
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,166
Bring those things over here.

4
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,000
- Okay!
- Okay!

5
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:33,133
Then, we'll start the introduction
music as we hit the lights.

6
00:02:33,466 --> 00:02:34,133
- Okay.
- Okay.

7
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,266
It's been a while since
you performed, huh?

8
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,566
Yes.

9
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:40,233
Let's do our best!

10
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:41,233
Yes!

11
00:02:48,566 --> 00:02:52,933
<i>Well, thank you for waiting.</i>
<i>We are now opening the doors.</i>

12
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:57,500
<i>Seats are all reserved,</i>
<i>so please don't run.</i>

13
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:01,066
All right everyone,
let's work hard today too!

14
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,766
- All right!
- All right!

15
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,800
<i>Please show the tickets</i>
<i>to the attendants.</i>

16
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:15,033
<i>Was that the right thing to do?</i>

17
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,400
Here, thank you very much!

18
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:27,000
What the heck is this?!

19
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,800
<i>Looks like my power is back.</i>

20
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:32,566
<i>This was the right thing to do.</i>

21
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:37,400
<i>Besides...</i>
<i>I remember her with no problem.</i>

22
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,066
But...

23
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:44,966
What are you doing here?

24
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:45,800
Meroko!

25
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:47,900
Today's the fated day!

26
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:50,333
This is no time to be daydreaming.

27
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:52,900
There's no stopping now
that we've made it here.

28
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,100
We have to work hard
for Mitsuki today!

29
00:03:57,366 --> 00:04:01,133
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>I must do what I can today.</i>

30
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,566
You don't have to tell me.

31
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:06,266
We'll prevent her from dying,
no matter what!

32
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,966
Yes, that's the spirit!

33
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,933
But we don't know where
other Death Spirits may come from.

34
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,066
Just make sure not to
leave Mitsuki's side.

35
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:18,233
I'll go check around.

36
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:19,233
Okay.

37
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:19,933
Later.

38
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:23,100
<i>Takuto...</i>

39
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,133
<i>In every case,</i>

40
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,800
<i>we Death Spirits were destined to</i>
<i>be separated from Mitsuki today.</i>

41
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:33,366
<i>But we're trying to change that,</i>

42
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,900
<i>so it wouldn't surprise me if</i>
<i>we lose something else instead.</i>

43
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:41,733
<i>So we must not let Mitsuki die,</i>
<i>no matter what!</i>

44
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:45,600
It's beautiful.
When we tested it on stage,

45
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:48,500
it looked so pretty shining in the light.

46
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:52,866
Oh, Meroko!
Look, look!

47
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,733
Isn't this pretty?
I'll be singing in this dress!

48
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:03,133
Meroko, what's wrong?

49
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,233
Nothing. It's wonderful!
It's so beautiful!

50
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:10,033
It'll look really good on Full Moon.

51
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:10,733
Yes!

52
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:15,366
Man, I wish I could've worn this when
we were at the studio rehearsal.

53
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,300
<i>What's gonna happen?</i>
<i>What's coming?</i>

54
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,200
<i>It doesn't matter what comes!</i>

55
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,133
<i>I won't give Mitsuki's life to</i>
<i>anyone no matter what!</i>

56
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,933
Hello Takuto.

57
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:42,233
How are you?

58
00:05:45,966 --> 00:05:46,633
Hi!

59
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,900
Izumi...

60
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Wow...

61
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,166
Don't look so scary.

62
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:53,466
Is it you?

63
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:54,633
What are you talking about?

64
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:56,866
Is it you who's going
to take Mitsuki's life?

65
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,066
No way. There's no reason for me
to do such a thing.

66
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,400
I can't get Mero to turn to me
even if I did that.

67
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:09,833
What is it?

68
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,666
Izumi, do you really like Meroko?

69
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,566
Why are you asking?

70
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:20,366
If you really like her, then why do you
do things that make her suffer?

71
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:23,933
I know...

72
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:29,466
What you want to say is, that in true love
you should care for each other, right?

73
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:36,200
But I know that's just an illusion.
So I'm just testing her.

74
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:43,433
Besides, whatever you try to do,
Mikki's life will end today.

75
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,300
Even if you don't do it,
someone else will come to do it anyway.

76
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:49,800
Fate won't change.

77
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:51,466
The result is the same.

78
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:54,066
There's no point in trying.

79
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,566
Izumi...

80
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:01,766
What is it?

81
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:06,133
Why do you think we
became Death Spirits?

82
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:10,533
It's a punishment for being careless
with our own lives.

83
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:18,800
Right. You must be right.
I didn't finish my life properly.

84
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,033
But I am so disgusted now
for being forced to see

85
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:25,200
the death of someone
that I care about.

86
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:31,466
That's the punishment.
We became Death Spirits to suffer.

87
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:33,766
Maybe you're right.

88
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,200
But I will prevent that destiny.

89
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,366
Nothing will start unless I move.

90
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,066
You are an optimist.

91
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:46,666
It's just that you're too pessimistic.

92
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:48,933
You think so?

93
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:52,966
See you.

94
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:54,733
Izumi!

95
00:07:55,966 --> 00:07:56,633
What?

96
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,266
Meroko is a good person.

97
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:01,633
I already know that.

98
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,033
Not only Meroko. There are people
that you can actually trust.

99
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:08,600
There's no need to test them.

100
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,633
I think I got enough pictures
from this area.

101
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:27,333
Then, let's head on in.

102
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:32,733
It's so amazing that this girl became
such a popular idol, isn't it?

103
00:08:32,766 --> 00:08:33,900
Totally!

104
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:38,300
I was like "huh?" back when she said
she was going to debut as a singer.

105
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:42,800
When I first saw the huge billboard of her,
I thought, "What?!"

106
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Where is Mitsuki?

107
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,200
With her grandmother, I think.

108
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:51,533
There are so many people here.

109
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:54,833
I wonder if Mitsuki was able
to find her friends.

110
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:56,633
She should be fine.

111
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,566
Oh, Ma'am, this way, this way!

112
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,866
Hello there!

113
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:06,200
I'll have two pamphlets, two necklaces
and two pen-lights as well, please.

114
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,000
Sure!

115
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:09,200
You really seem to know
what you're doing.

116
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,733
Oh, yes, of course!

117
00:09:10,766 --> 00:09:13,733
I used to always come to shows
without your knowledge!

118
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,766
Is that so?

119
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:18,766
Well, not always.

120
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,333
It was just once in a while!
Just once in a while.

121
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:23,200
I really don't come to
shows that often.

122
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,866
Wow!

123
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,300
So many people came for me.

124
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:34,200
Meroko...

125
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:37,133
How does it look around the area?

126
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,066
Not much going on.

127
00:09:38,466 --> 00:09:39,633
How about here?
Did anyone come?

128
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:42,666
No problem here.
No one has come here.

129
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,866
Okay.

130
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:45,266
Takuto?

131
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:46,800
Did something happen?

132
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:49,200
What happened? What do you mean?

133
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:51,566
You're acting a bit strange.

134
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,966
What are you saying?
Takuto is always like this.

135
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,033
It's starting!

136
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:04,166
<i>Hello everybody!</i>
<i>Welcome to Full Moon's "Live"!</i>

137
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:10,200
<i>Before Full Moon comes out in</i>
<i>just a little bit, let's get pumped!</i>

138
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:11,566
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

139
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,666
<i>Without further ado,</i>
<i>I'll introduce you to a wonderful guest!</i>

140
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:20,233
<i>She rushed over here for Full Moon!</i>
<i>Madoka Wakamatsu!</i>

141
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,700
<i>The song is, of course,</i>
<i>"Eternal Snow"!</i>

142
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:45,600
<i>How long has it been ever since</i>
<i>I fell in love with you?</i>

143
00:10:46,066 --> 00:10:52,800
<i>My feelings just keep</i>
<i>getting stronger...</i>

144
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,533
She's so lively.

145
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,200
She's a clumsy one, but looks like
she's found her own way to live her life.

146
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,566
Yes.

147
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:07,366
Even if Madoka says all those things,
I think she likes Full Moon.

148
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:11,500
I think she gets the motivation
to work hard from Full Moon.

149
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:17,033
No, Madoka is someone who could sing
very well even if Full Moon didn't exist.

150
00:11:17,366 --> 00:11:20,500
Just look at her singing so happily.

151
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:24,866
<i>Hold me tight.</i>

152
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,266
<i>If loving someone was</i>
<i>going to feel like this,</i>

153
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,000
<i>I wish I never found out</i>
<i>about love.</i>

154
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:36,366
I won't lose to her!

155
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:42,000
Because I'm singing the songs I love
so much, I'll sing happily like Madoka.

156
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:45,733
So I won't lose fighting
against my fate!

157
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,133
Mitsuki...

158
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:48,533
That's right!

159
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,833
We will support you too,
so defeat fate with your singing!

160
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,366
Thank you, Meroko.

161
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,700
Mitsuki...

162
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,433
Dr. Herberd.

163
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,666
We've been looking forward
to your visit.

164
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,766
Today is the day, Mr. Wakaoji.

165
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:32,033
Yes.

166
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:33,533
<i>Today is the day.</i>

167
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,333
<i>Everything will finish today.</i>

168
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,300
<i>If Mitsuki is fine</i>
<i>after midnight tonight,</i>

169
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,833
<i>that means that we were able</i>
<i>to change her fate.</i>

170
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:46,400
<i>I will protect her till then,</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

171
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:51,600
<i>So, Keichi, you must</i>
<i>succeed in the surgery.</i>

172
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:52,833
<i>Yes.</i>

173
00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:54,066
<i>All right.</i>
<i>I'm counting on you.</i>

174
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,233
<i>Takuto!</i>

175
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,266
<i>After everything is finished</i>
<i>and tomorrow comes,</i>

176
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,100
<i>let's jam together again.</i>

177
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,033
<i>Yeah!</i>

178
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:09,933
Okay, let's go!

179
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:11,833
Let me carry your luggage.

180
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:13,200
Oh, thank you.

181
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:17,500
<i>Thank you for</i>
<i>a lovely performance!</i>

182
00:13:17,766 --> 00:13:21,400
<i>By the way, what kind of artist</i>
<i>is Full Moon in your eyes, Madoka?</i>

183
00:13:21,533 --> 00:13:25,600
<i>For me, she's someone</i>
<i>who's destined to be my rival!</i>

184
00:13:25,733 --> 00:13:26,900
<i>I see.</i>

185
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:28,966
<i>If I remember it correctly,</i>

186
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,066
<i>you were supposed to release a song</i>
<i>at the same time as Full Moon, right?</i>

187
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:36,966
<i>Yes! I actually kind of</i>
<i>got depressed then, but...</i>

188
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,433
<i>Oh, you did, Madoka?</i>

189
00:13:38,766 --> 00:13:44,966
<i>I think people see me as someone</i>
<i>who says whatever comes to my mind,</i>

190
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,033
<i>but I am really a pretty</i>
<i>sensitive person.</i>

191
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,766
<i>Huh?</i>

192
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:49,500
Just listen to her.

193
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:51,100
She's clearly gotten over it well.

194
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,566
<i>Well, that aside,</i>

195
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,066
<i>we will be looking forward to</i>
<i>everything you do in the future!</i>

196
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,466
- Izumi,
<i>- Yes, of course!</i>

197
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,133
- we're not going back yet?
<i>- That was Wakamatsu Madoka,</i>

198
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,166
- No.
<i>- everyone!</i>

199
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,366
- Why? Tell me why?
<i>- Thank you!</i>

200
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,800
Shut up, it's none
of your business.

201
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,300
So, Mitsuki, it's almost time to go.

202
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,166
Okay!

203
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:14,733
Takuto, please turn me
into Full Moon.

204
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Are you okay?

205
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:17,233
Yes, I am!

206
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,666
I really want to sing now!

207
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,166
I want to sing to the entire world.

208
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,366
Got it.

209
00:14:34,766 --> 00:14:35,966
N-No way!

210
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,033
She can't transform?

211
00:14:38,266 --> 00:14:39,900
What happened, Meroko?

212
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:41,933
Takuto's power isn't working!

213
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:42,633
What?

214
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,633
What about the concert?

215
00:14:48,033 --> 00:14:52,066
<i>Full Moon, long time no see.</i>
<i>Congratulations on your first live show.</i>

216
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,800
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>I can't make it today,</i>

217
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,366
<i>but I will definitely come and</i>
<i>support you next time, so keep it up.</i>

218
00:14:58,033 --> 00:15:00,600
<i>I look forward to seeing you again.</i>
<i>So long.</i>

219
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:05,100
<i>All right, that was</i>
<i>a video letter from Miss Komaki!</i>

220
00:15:05,266 --> 00:15:08,066
<i>Now, Full Moon will finally</i>
<i>come out on stage soon!</i>

221
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Takuto...

222
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:21,000
My power isn't enough.

223
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:26,200
The effect of the Flower of Forgetfulness
probably hasn't kicked in yet,

224
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:27,933
but once it starts working...

225
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:32,233
Damn it! Why can't I use my power
at such a critical moment?!

226
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:33,966
Just start working now!

227
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:40,766
That's okay if I can't transform
into Full Moon.

228
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,566
- What?
- What?

229
00:15:41,633 --> 00:15:45,366
I'll sing... just as my
12-year-old self.

230
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,166
But then...

231
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,233
I was able to become a singer

232
00:15:49,266 --> 00:15:52,100
because Takuto allowed me
to transform into Full Moon.

233
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,766
I was able to live a completely different
life from the one I used to live.

234
00:15:57,433 --> 00:16:00,400
So that's already more than enough.

235
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:04,633
When is Full Moon coming out?

236
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,100
She's so late.

237
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:07,500
She's coming now!

238
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:08,533
Please!

239
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,900
What should we do?

240
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:14,133
We'll take care of things here,
so please take care of the stage.

241
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,300
All right!

242
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:17,933
Mitsuki, you...

243
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:19,466
It's okay.

244
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,666
I can't project my voice as much,
but my desire to sing is all the same.

245
00:16:24,966 --> 00:16:25,633
No!

246
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,000
Mitsuki, that's impossible.

247
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:33,400
Yeah, the audience is waiting for
Full Moon to come on stage now.

248
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:36,033
Ms. Oshige!

249
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:37,133
Where's Full Moon?

250
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,133
Okay. I'll fill the time.

251
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,066
<i>Hey everybody!</i>
<i>I don't think you're loud enough!</i>

252
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:50,566
<i>You've got to call Full Moon</i>
<i>in a much louder voice!</i>

253
00:16:50,633 --> 00:16:55,933
- Full Moon!
- Full Moon!

254
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,466
But...

255
00:16:59,866 --> 00:17:03,133
No one will understand that
you are Full Moon.

256
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,833
Everyone will be confused.

257
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,866
But...

258
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,900
Damn it! It's my fault.

259
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,833
- Meroko?
- You...

260
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:43,033
Here, Takuto.

261
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,066
What? What's this?

262
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:49,033
I'm giving you my power.

263
00:17:49,366 --> 00:17:51,466
But if you do that...

264
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:56,000
Don't worry about me.
Please transform Mitsuki into Full Moon.

265
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,533
This is the last time
she can sing as Full Moon.

266
00:18:01,366 --> 00:18:02,366
Meroko...

267
00:18:02,933 --> 00:18:06,100
- Full Moon, Full Moon, Full Moon!
- Full Moon, Full Moon, Full Moon!

268
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,900
This ring will lead
my power to you, Takuto.

269
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,266
We are going to join our power.

270
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,166
Thank you, Meroko.

271
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,566
You better be really grateful
for a young lady's hair.

272
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,400
I've given you my treasure.

273
00:18:23,466 --> 00:18:24,133
Okay?

274
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,366
Meroko...

275
00:18:47,566 --> 00:18:49,066
Let's go, Mitsuki!

276
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,000
But...

277
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:50,800
It's fine!

278
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:53,133
I won't lose.

279
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,500
I won't forget about you
no matter what, either!

280
00:18:59,966 --> 00:19:09,500
- Full Moon, Full Moon!
- Full Moon, Full Moon!

281
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:27,500
<i>How long has it been</i>
<i>since I fell in love with you?</i>

282
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:36,633
<i>My feelings keep getting stronger.</i>

283
00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:56,400
<i>They're silent like the snow,</i>
<i>but they keep building up.</i>

284
00:19:57,933 --> 00:20:06,600
<i>Hold me tight. If loving someone</i>
<i>was going to feel like this,</i>

285
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:15,800
<i>I wish I never found out about love.</i>

286
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:23,933
<i>I love you, my tears won't stop.</i>

287
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:37,800
<i>If this is how it's going to be,</i>
<i>I wish I had never met you.</i>

288
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:46,900
<i>- If the snow falls forever,</i>
- I... I...

289
00:20:46,933 --> 00:20:53,833
<i>- will I be able to let go</i>
- Who am I?

290
00:20:53,866 --> 00:20:56,866
<i>- of these thoughts of you?</i>
- Your name is Takuto.

291
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,633
Takuto? Why am I here?

292
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:04,066
Because...

293
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:11,333
Because you're going to
make new memories.

294
00:21:12,266 --> 00:21:14,700
New memories...

295
00:21:16,466 --> 00:21:19,866
<i>I love you.</i>

296
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:24,466
<i>The feeling of love fills my heart...</i>

297
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:32,566
<i>I want to scream in the winter sky</i>
<i>that I want to see you right now.</i>

298
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,900
This is my first listen,
but her song is really good.

299
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:38,600
Yeah.

300
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:24,000
It's a really good song.
Hey, what's her name?

301
00:23:24,366 --> 00:23:28,400
She's Full Moon.
No, she's Mitsuki.

302
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,133
Mitsuki?

303
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:33,966
Yes. She's the girl you threw
everything away to protect.

304
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,366
I protected her?

305
00:23:35,566 --> 00:23:40,033
Here, this is her last song.
We have to listen.

306
00:23:40,366 --> 00:23:41,033
Yeah.

307
00:23:41,866 --> 00:23:45,200
Next time on the final episode of Full Moon:
"Looking for the Full Moon."

308
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:46,633
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
