1
00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:06,600
After what happened
at the audition,

2
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:09,533
I had a falling out with Takuto
and couldn't go home.

3
00:00:09,766 --> 00:00:11,866
But Mitsuki told me
she wanted me to return.

4
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:14,000
At first, the both of us
were hesitant.

5
00:00:14,066 --> 00:00:18,866
But with Mitsuki's persistence and pleading,
I was able to make up with him.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,033
We celebrated the revival
of our partnership

7
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:24,466
and set off Green Onion Ramen
fireworks and it felt really good!

8
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:27,766
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

9
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:33,466
Got that?

10
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:34,600
Yes.

11
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,633
It looks like her illness
hasn't progressed.

12
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:23,133
How about it?
Can she return to work?

13
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,700
Certainly when you compare
it to the 12-year-old's X-ray,

14
00:02:27,966 --> 00:02:31,266
symptoms are not at all visible in
the condition of the 16-year-old's.

15
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:34,600
Well, how about it?

16
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,766
Let's see.

17
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,233
If she doesn't push herself...

18
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:42,533
- What?! Yay!
- Yes!

19
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:45,066
That's great, isn't it, Mitsuki!

20
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:45,600
Yes.

21
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:46,933
Dr. Wakaoji!

22
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,266
I promise.
I won't push myself again!

23
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:52,533
Hm? Good.

24
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,466
Dr. Wakaoji, thank you very much.

25
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,800
Thank you very much!

26
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:07,366
At any rate, that's really great.

27
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:10,733
You can sing songs
as Full Moon again.

28
00:03:10,866 --> 00:03:11,333
Yeah.

29
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,600
More importantly, Dr. Wakaoji
forgave me, I'm really happy!

30
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:17,866
Yeah, yeah.

31
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,133
What is it?

32
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:24,966
Umm... You're Takuto, right?

33
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,366
That's right.

34
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,666
Who's the rabbit next to you?

35
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,233
I'm Meroko!

36
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:31,733
Oh... I see.

37
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:37,433
Somehow it feels like I'm recapturing
the thread of a bad dream.

38
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:39,000
That's rude!

39
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:43,266
A bad dream, like we are spooks
and specters or something.

40
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:45,933
We are bona fide Death Spirits,
you know?!

41
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:47,500
Death Spirits...

42
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:49,733
Yes, that's it.

43
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:50,366
Oh!

44
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:52,633
Meroko, don't say that now.

45
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:57,466
Why not?
I mean, why does she know about us?

46
00:03:57,766 --> 00:04:00,300
What in the world happened
while I wasn't around?!

47
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,833
It can't be helped, can it?

48
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:04,833
The situation required it.

49
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:09,900
It seems like we're always carried
away by the situation requiring it.

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,800
Is this okay,
Green Onion Ramen?

51
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:15,300
W-Well, you've got the official word that

52
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,666
you're okay as long as you're
in your current condition.

53
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:21,433
So, from now on, we have to
think of Mitsuki's body first.

54
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,066
Thank you, Ms. Oshige.

55
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:24,866
Work with all your might!

56
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:25,533
Yes!

57
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,200
<i>The time has come
to start working again.</i>

58
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,733
<i>I have to do my best.</i>

59
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:41,033
Oh... Good morning, Mr. Todoroki.

60
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,933
What? Ms. Oshige,
I haven't seen you in a while.

61
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:46,433
Starting today Full Moon is back at work.

62
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,966
Thanks in advance for your help.

63
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:49,633
Yes, thank you.

64
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:51,100
Oh, now that you mention it...

65
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:54,666
How are you? Are you feeling well?

66
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,233
Yes, sorry to have troubled you.

67
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,166
I hope you are,
take care of yourself.

68
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:00,833
I will.

69
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:02,433
Well... Excuse me.

70
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:03,366
Excuse me!

71
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,633
They say that she's in
poor physical condition

72
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,800
but I wonder what
it was really about.

73
00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:11,733
What do you mean?

74
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,966
There's a rumor that
she has a boyfriend.

75
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,633
I've heard she doesn't deny it either.

76
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:21,266
One could say she's bold,
or maybe shameless.

77
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,866
Oh, is that so?

78
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,866
But that rumor,
who did you hear it from?

79
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,033
Well, that's uh...

80
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,766
Ms. Sasaki?

81
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:32,733
Hm?

82
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,366
She returns to work starting today?
Full Moon...

83
00:05:35,766 --> 00:05:37,400
Yes, so it seems.

84
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:39,833
For the taping of a music show.

85
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,000
Hmm.

86
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,266
<i>The talk of her missing
the audition in such manner</i>

87
00:05:45,366 --> 00:05:47,366
<i>is already resounding
throughout the industry.</i>

88
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:50,600
<i>If she thinks she can make
a comeback that easily</i>

89
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:51,866
<i>she's got another thing coming.</i>

90
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:54,600
<i>I mean, rather, I won't let her.</i>

91
00:05:58,933 --> 00:05:59,933
Good morning!

92
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,633
- Oh...
- She's here.

93
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,366
Must be nice,
they say she has a boyfriend.

94
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:11,266
To think she can afford to cut back
on her work! What luxury.

95
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:13,866
I think she's letting her popularity
getting to her head.

96
00:06:14,366 --> 00:06:15,900
Pretty conceited for a new face!

97
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,833
There's, like, a negative vibe.

98
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,633
Don't take them seriously, Mitsuki.

99
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:22,066
<i>But...</i>

100
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:25,466
<i>This on the first day of her comeback.</i>

101
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,833
They say his name is Eichi.

102
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,166
<i>Huh?! Why do they know that much?</i>

103
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:35,966
W-What was that about?!

104
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,300
Don't just keep quiet!
Say something back!

105
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,133
Meroko!

106
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,100
- Hey!
- Huh?

107
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,166
Good morning!

108
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:43,366
Mr. Takasu?!

109
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,166
Congratulations on your comeback!

110
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,800
What? Um...

111
00:06:47,966 --> 00:06:50,466
I was really surprised when
I heard you'd collapsed!

112
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:52,766
But you're returning today? Work hard!

113
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:55,333
Mr. Takasu, thank you so much!

114
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,033
This bouquet is so big.

115
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,566
Wow... It smells so good!

116
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,900
Well, I thought it would
liven things up!

117
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,100
It's about time, shall we go?

118
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:06,700
Yeah.

119
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:11,066
Well, do your best!

120
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:11,933
Yes!

121
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,033
That man is unexpectedly nice.

122
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:21,566
I'm a bit surprised.

123
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:22,700
That aside...

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,600
What is it, Ms. Oshige?

125
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:28,933
Things with Eichi have become even
more of a rumor than I thought.

126
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:30,066
Yes.

127
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:33,400
I hope it doesn't become
a terrible scandal.

128
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,666
Huh? And how bad could that be?

129
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:38,300
That's fine.

130
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,600
If there's a little bit of a scandal,

131
00:07:40,633 --> 00:07:43,800
then surely it will be easier
for Eichi to find Mitsuki!

132
00:07:44,033 --> 00:07:46,066
That's another way to think about it.

133
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,666
I've always suspected it,

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,766
but you're the kind of girl to always
gain something from a mistake.

135
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:53,200
You know it!

136
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:55,433
What? That's a compliment, right?

137
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,433
Huh? Yeah.
Well, let's leave it at that.

138
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:04,233
And...Mr. Takasu was checking on
how she was doing.

139
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,266
What was that?

140
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,900
What's going on?!

141
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,400
Why does it go so well for her?
Why is she loved by everyone?!

142
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:17,766
Even though she hasn't
put in any effort!

143
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:21,933
If it were me,
it wouldn't be going this well.

144
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,866
I wouldn't be accepted by
those around me like she is.

145
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:27,433
<i>I know.</i>

146
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,533
<i>After all, this world has
always been cold to me.</i>

147
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,233
<i>I wonder if she's lost.</i>

148
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:56,866
<i>Oh!</i>

149
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,566
<i>Oh... Thank you.</i>

150
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,300
<i>Um... Where are you going?</i>

151
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:08,133
<i>I want to go to my grandchild's house,
on this map.</i>

152
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:13,700
<i>I know this place.
I'll take you.</i>

153
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:28,833
<i>Good morning!</i>

154
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,866
<i>What do you mean "good morning"?!
You're late!</i>

155
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:33,300
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

156
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:35,800
<i>You're an hour late,
are you taking us for a ride?</i>

157
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,133
<i>I'm sorry!
I'll get ready right now!</i>

158
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:41,000
<i>There's no need for that!</i>

159
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:42,500
<i>We've already found
your replacement!</i>

160
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:43,166
<i>What?</i>

161
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,800
<i>You don't have to come anymore!</i>

162
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,666
<i>No way...</i>

163
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,233
<i>What on earth were you doing?!</i>

164
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:56,833
<i>Because...there was an old lady
who was lost and...</i>

165
00:09:57,366 --> 00:10:00,966
<i>Listen! In this world, you are
the most important thing!</i>

166
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:05,100
<i>You won't rise to the top
by caring about someone else!</i>

167
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:13,700
<i>After that, they started the rumor
that I was conceited,</i>

168
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:15,766
<i>and my jobs were cancelled
one after the next.</i>

169
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,733
<i>Even though I did something
that was to be expected.</i>

170
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:25,366
<i>I can't forgive it.</i>

171
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:27,300
<i>Why?</i>

172
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:32,533
<i>Since then, I've put
in so much effort.</i>

173
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,566
<i>I did everything to
change the image</i>

174
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,533
<i>that I was conceited,
which stuck from that one time.</i>

175
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,133
<i>I always looked at the reactions
of those around me</i>

176
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,000
<i>and tried to be nice.</i>

177
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,000
<i>Even so...</i>

178
00:10:46,266 --> 00:10:47,666
<i>Why is it always that girl?!</i>

179
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:31,366
Mitsuki.

180
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,666
Don't worry about it.

181
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:35,100
Okay.

182
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,033
Miss Full Moon!

183
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:38,500
Rehearsal, please.

184
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:39,800
Oh...yes!

185
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:48,233
Well then, camera test, please.

186
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:49,966
We're starting!

187
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:53,100
5 seconds, 4, 3...

188
00:11:56,733 --> 00:12:02,033
<i>Why do I like you so much?</i>

189
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:08,833
<i>My tears are falling.</i>

190
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:27,866
<i>Because in the past
there were a lot of things I lost...</i>

191
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,366
<i>And I couldn't sing.</i>

192
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:35,166
<i>A distance place—</i>

193
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,133
<i>I wonder if everyone is telling
rumors about me.</i>

194
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:44,400
<i>...was where I belonged</i>

195
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,700
Who's that?!

196
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,666
Oh, I'm sorry!

197
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,433
Stop the music!

198
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:52,700
I'm disappointed in you!

199
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,833
Disrupting someone's song...

200
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:57,833
Ms. Komaki!

201
00:12:58,566 --> 00:12:59,733
I-I'm sorry!

202
00:13:00,266 --> 00:13:02,066
If you call yourself
professional singers,

203
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:05,466
you should listen to the singing
of others with the proper respect!

204
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:06,733
- Y-Yes!
- Y-Yes!

205
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,800
- You are absolutely right, Ms. Komaki!
- You are absolutely right, Ms. Komaki!

206
00:13:09,366 --> 00:13:12,266
And you, your song is not all there.

207
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,300
What happened?

208
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,633
Where is the power you had
when you turned on me that time?

209
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,166
I-I'm sorry!

210
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:19,100
And you over there!

211
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,600
If you have time to lurk around
in the shadows,

212
00:13:22,766 --> 00:13:25,000
how about studying acting
for a little bit?

213
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,333
<i>Madoka...</i>

214
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,733
It seems you've been spreading
rumors for some time.

215
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:31,933
You can't stand a fair match
based on your own merits?

216
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,000
If so, that's the same
as losing from the start!

217
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:37,966
<i>Madoka? Rumors?</i>

218
00:13:39,766 --> 00:13:42,100
Th-That's right! We...

219
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,300
We took what Madoka said at face value!

220
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:46,866
I'm sorry.

221
00:13:51,366 --> 00:13:55,133
I-I think I did something
that is unforgivable.

222
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:58,800
But... I'm envious of Full Moon.

223
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,033
<i>Madoka... Jealous of me?</i>

224
00:14:02,866 --> 00:14:07,400
But telling rumors in the shadows...
that wasn't my intention.

225
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:10,900
It's just, it must be nice to have
someone that you like.

226
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,833
I want to see what it's like to
like someone like that.

227
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:19,533
I didn't think it would be
that much of a rumor.

228
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:25,600
I'm sorry.
That wasn't my intention.

229
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,200
What? No...that's okay.

230
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm sure that Eichi will find you.

231
00:14:34,266 --> 00:14:35,033
Thank you.

232
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,433
I think that Madoka is
a nicer girl than I thought.

233
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,500
That's right!

234
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,733
There are times when you can't
convey what you want to convey.

235
00:14:44,966 --> 00:14:46,133
I hope that's it.

236
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:46,800
What?

237
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,133
Meroko, what do you mean by that?

238
00:14:50,866 --> 00:14:51,666
Let's see.

239
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,300
Oh!

240
00:14:53,766 --> 00:14:55,700
Oh my... What happened?

241
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:56,700
Th-That...

242
00:14:56,866 --> 00:14:57,866
Huh? Oh no!

243
00:14:58,666 --> 00:14:59,833
What happened?

244
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,000
What, what?

245
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,900
Who? Who did this horrible thing?!

246
00:15:05,466 --> 00:15:06,066
Oh...

247
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,366
Oh! Hello?
This is Oshige.

248
00:15:08,566 --> 00:15:10,900
Is Yasuno the stylist there?

249
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,900
What? She's not?

250
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:14,100
Do you know where she went?

251
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:19,000
Huh? We have a big problem with
Full Moon's wardrobe!

252
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:24,666
Oh no! Why now, of all times,
can't I get in contact with her?!

253
00:15:24,866 --> 00:15:25,633
Mitsuki?

254
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,033
What was that?!

255
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,200
It looks like we were frivolously
passing on rumors by ourselves!

256
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:40,766
And she was the one bad mouthing
Full Moon not long ago!

257
00:15:41,466 --> 00:15:43,766
She talks out of both sides
of her mouth!

258
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:47,233
Now, for the first time, I understand
the scary side of this business!

259
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:53,333
That just now...
What was that about?

260
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,666
Uh...um...

261
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,866
Of course! It's just as I thought.

262
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,666
What? What do you mean
of course, Meroko?

263
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,933
Madoka's tears just now
were all an act!

264
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:05,900
What? So, do you mean
that Madoka did it?

265
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:08,600
Stop it, it's not like there's proof!

266
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,766
Yeah, but think about that
conversation just now.

267
00:16:11,866 --> 00:16:13,800
That's the only thing I can think of!

268
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,600
Right now, there's no use in
saying stuff like that.

269
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:20,166
Anyway, we have to do something
about this situation.

270
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,466
Y-Yes, I can't catch Ms. Yasuno!

271
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,466
Oh no! What should I do?!

272
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:28,933
That's it!

273
00:16:29,266 --> 00:16:33,366
Hey hey, this is a place to
showcase my powers, don't you think?

274
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:33,833
What?

275
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:35,633
Powers?! What's that?

276
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:38,300
Well, leave it to me.

277
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:45,333
Mero-Mero Change!

278
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:48,866
Oh my...

279
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,466
What? Th-This? This is a little...

280
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,800
What are you doing?!

281
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,000
What? That's strange.

282
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:56,700
One more time!

283
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,366
Meroko... Are you playing around?

284
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:06,166
Um... We don't have much time.

285
00:17:06,466 --> 00:17:08,233
L-Leave it to me I said!

286
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:09,166
Here!

287
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,700
W-What?

288
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:18,866
Please! We have only 30 minutes
until the performance.

289
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:20,200
That's strange.

290
00:17:20,566 --> 00:17:24,000
Hmm... How was it for
an idol's wardrobe again?

291
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:24,966
That's okay.

292
00:17:25,066 --> 00:17:25,833
- Huh?
- What?

293
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:30,700
I don't know who did this to
my wardrobe or why.

294
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,700
But...

295
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,933
No matter who did it,
I don't want it to get me down.

296
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,533
You...

297
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,666
- Mitsuki!
- No!

298
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,033
Hey! I said hey!

299
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:51,333
Have you gone crazy?

300
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:57,100
Stop! Stop! What in the world
are you doing, Mitsuki?!

301
00:18:05,366 --> 00:18:08,333
I'm sure that she's in a fluster about
not having her wardrobe about now.

302
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:09,900
Serves her right.

303
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:16,733
<i>Why do I like you so much?</i>

304
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:22,933
<i>Your voice echoes and
it sounds almost sad.</i>

305
00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:28,866
<i>Up to now what was supporting me?</i>

306
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:37,100
<i>I realize, now that I'm far away.
What was supporting me?</i>

307
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:50,466
<i>Why do I like you?</i>

308
00:18:50,500 --> 00:19:00,766
<i>That's too easy to answer.</i>

309
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:07,333
Everyone, I'm really sorry to
have caused you trouble

310
00:19:07,566 --> 00:19:10,866
by suddenly taking a break.

311
00:19:11,966 --> 00:19:15,066
Although I might not be the best,
I'll continue to work my hardest.

312
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,866
Please continue to support me!

313
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:25,800
That was great!

314
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,466
When I watched the rehearsal
earlier I wondered how it would go.

315
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,200
Thank you very much!

316
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:33,300
Continue to do your best!

317
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:33,866
Yes!

318
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:58,500
The sudden change of wardrobe really
surprised me, but this is good.

319
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,200
As a comeback, too, it's a big success.

320
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,666
Thank you!

321
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:05,966
Well, it seems that there are
some strange rumors,

322
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
but don't worry about it.

323
00:20:07,466 --> 00:20:09,433
It happens a lot in this world.

324
00:20:09,566 --> 00:20:10,033
Yes!

325
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,066
Well then, take care.

326
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,500
Good job!

327
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,600
I never would have guessed

328
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:24,300
that you'd arrange and wear
your costume in that manner.

329
00:20:25,866 --> 00:20:29,500
This is one little girl who always
gains something from her mistakes.

330
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:33,100
Really, at one point, I wondered
what was going to happen.

331
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:35,166
This kid's gotten tough.

332
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,466
Absolutely.

333
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,266
But you know, that Madoka
is so unforgivable!

334
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,633
Save your breath, Meroko.

335
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:46,100
I haven't understood the
conversation for a while.

336
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,533
Did something happen?

337
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,700
Somebody cut this girl's wardrobe
into shreds!

338
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,466
What? What did you say?!

339
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:53,566
I'm fine.

340
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:55,700
Don't worry, Dr. Wakaoji.

341
00:20:56,433 --> 00:20:57,100
But...

342
00:20:58,033 --> 00:20:59,933
I'm just fine!

343
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:03,166
These kind of things won't
get me down at all! Right?

344
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,900
Mitsuki, you really like
singing, don't you?

345
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,800
I understand.

346
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:13,500
I won't waver anymore.

347
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,733
Dr. Wakaoji?

348
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:23,133
I'll search for some way for you, Mitsuki,
to do without an operation.

349
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:24,333
Really?

350
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,066
Yes.

351
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,100
But don't overdo it.

352
00:21:28,733 --> 00:21:31,133
There are going to be many things
you need to pay attention to

353
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,400
on your return to work
after a long break.

354
00:21:33,966 --> 00:21:35,666
But, really, don't push yourself.

355
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:36,766
Okay!

356
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:21,466
This is bad! This is bad!
Takuto, what are we gonna do?

357
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,133
What are you so upset for?

358
00:23:23,366 --> 00:23:25,800
Her first solo performance
has been planned

359
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,033
so this is no time for all of this.

360
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:30,666
The thing is that there's trouble
with that solo performance!

361
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,000
What happened?

362
00:23:32,533 --> 00:23:36,066
Someone has cancelled the event site
where she was to perform!

363
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,700
But the performance is tomorrow!
What are we gonna do?

364
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:43,866
Next time on Full Moon:
"A Solo Performance - Live!"

365
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,166
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
