1
00:00:06,233 --> 00:00:07,466
This is the Flower
of Forgetfulness.

2
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:10,133
I believe a Death Spirit
who recovers his memory

3
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:12,366
becomes a ghost because of
the attachment to his life on earth.

4
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:16,333
That's why, if his memory is erased
with this Flower of Forgetfulness...

5
00:00:19,366 --> 00:00:20,033
But...

6
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:23,033
<i>- Staying a Death Spirit by losing</i>
- Whose fault do you think

7
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:24,466
<i>- by losing his memories</i>
- it is that I look like this?!

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,500
<i>- or becoming a ghost</i>
- You said it was the cat

9
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:26,533
<i>- by holding on</i>
- on the second block, right?

10
00:00:26,566 --> 00:00:28,733
<i>- to the memories.</i>
- Y-Yeah, it's because of the cat.

11
00:00:28,766 --> 00:00:30,133
<i>- Which one would</i>
- The cat, the cat, the cat!

12
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,233
<i>- make Takuto happy?</i>
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

13
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,566
<i>I couldn't say it last night</i>
<i>or the night before.</i>

14
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,033
I'm going to say it tonight.

15
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:33,333
Yeah.

16
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:37,266
Hey, are you all made up,
graduate?

17
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,366
Takuto, you're coming too?

18
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,100
Stupid, do you think I would
miss your graduation?

19
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,533
Oh, right.

20
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:48,900
Hey, hey,
if you're like that already,

21
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:51,733
you might even cry
before the graduation!

22
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,466
Huh?

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,900
Make sure to smile
as you graduate.

24
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:56,266
Yeah!

25
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,433
<i>Wakana Kimura.</i>

26
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,366
Yes!

27
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:22,300
<i>Mitsuki Koyama.</i>

28
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,266
Yes!

29
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:29,866
Ma'am...

30
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Congratulations.

31
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:43,133
<i>Kumi Sagimiya.</i>

32
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:44,033
Yes!

33
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,233
Congratulations, Mitsuki.

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,533
We finally graduated.

35
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:07,066
It's farewell to
this school today.

36
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:12,400
But next month, we're just moving
to the junior high next door.

37
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:13,100
Yeah.

38
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:18,066
I'm just so glad that I got to
graduate with all of you.

39
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,566
Of course you'd
graduate with us!

40
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:25,666
Mitsuki.

41
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,700
- We should be going soon.
- Oh...yes.

42
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,300
Mitsuki!

43
00:04:30,266 --> 00:04:31,600
Dr. Wakaoji...

44
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,366
This is the first time
I've come here with you.

45
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:53,400
Yes.

46
00:04:54,766 --> 00:04:55,900
I am sorry.

47
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,300
Grandma...

48
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:06,133
Dad, mom... I graduated from
elementary school today.

49
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,900
Aoi, Hazuki, she will be thirteen
next month and go into junior high.

50
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,066
I will take responsibility in
raising your daughter well.

51
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,300
Grandma...

52
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:26,900
That's right. Mitsuki, there is still
a very long road ahead in life.

53
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,533
Doctor Herberd,
who will be present at the surgery,

54
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:32,733
is set to arrive in
Japan next week.

55
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,966
Thank you, Dr. Wakaoji.

56
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,866
Sure.

57
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,066
All right.

58
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:49,566
Well, we do wanna end
with something great,

59
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,033
so maybe we could
do "Myself."

60
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:52,533
And then...

61
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,866
Do you want me to say it?

62
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:03,100
No, I'll say it.

63
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:04,233
Say, Mitsuki.

64
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:06,966
Continuing our conversation
from before...

65
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,666
Huh?

66
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:10,133
The conversation about how
we should do the concert.

67
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:11,233
Oh, yeah.

68
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:14,233
I thought about the order of the songs,
but how about this?

69
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,300
Y-Yeah.

70
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:16,900
Looks good.

71
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:20,300
Doesn't it? Now we have to
think about stage direction.

72
00:06:20,366 --> 00:06:21,366
Mitsuki...

73
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,233
Actually, I won't do it today.

74
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,300
We grew wings when
we did "Myself" before.

75
00:07:51,266 --> 00:07:52,266
Is he okay?

76
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,266
Yeah.

77
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:54,233
But...

78
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:06,733
Don't worry about it.

79
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,900
Leave your concert up to me.

80
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,000
Of course I believe in you,
Takuto.

81
00:08:13,466 --> 00:08:15,700
But... But what if...

82
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:19,933
What if there is a way for you
to not have to become a ghost?

83
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,700
If there were a way,
I would have done it already.

84
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:24,266
In that case...

85
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:26,100
Is there a way?

86
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:30,566
You become a ghost because
you recover your memory.

87
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,833
Isn't that true? Then...

88
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,533
You're saying I should
erase my memory again?

89
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:37,866
Y-Yes.

90
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,600
No thanks.

91
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:45,100
Just like how you graduated

92
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:47,633
from elementary school with
all sorts of memories,

93
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,866
I want to graduate from being
a Death Spirit with all my memories.

94
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,100
It's totally better
to do it that way

95
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:57,866
than to throw away all your memories
to be a Death Spirit forever.

96
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,166
Takuto...

97
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,500
I was able to make lots of
good memories this year.

98
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,066
Most of all,
I was able to meet you.

99
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:13,400
By being around you, I was able to
feel like I was making music too.

100
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:16,233
It was fun.

101
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,466
It's thanks to you that
I was able to sing.

102
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:24,800
I'm also really glad I...

103
00:09:48,766 --> 00:09:52,733
Even I know that nothing is
going to happen by saying this.

104
00:09:54,966 --> 00:09:58,066
You are a human being
and I am a Death Spirit.

105
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,500
It's something no one
can do anything about, but...

106
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,000
I like you, Mitsuki.

107
00:10:21,966 --> 00:10:25,466
Well...I just wanted to say that.
But you can just forget about it.

108
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,433
I guess it's one-sided.

109
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,700
Oh man.

110
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,933
Happy birthday, Mitsuki!

111
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:32,033
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

112
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,566
Thank you, everybody.

113
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,366
You turned thirteen
before the rest of us!

114
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,800
You're so grown up!

115
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:43,066
Hey, hey, if a 13-year-old
is a grown-up, then what am I?

116
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:46,833
Oh, Ms. Oshige!

117
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:49,533
Hey, you seem too be
doing well.

118
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
- Huh?
- Huh?

119
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,300
- Wow! Madoka Wakamatsu!
- Wow! Madoka Wakamatsu!

120
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,333
Hello!

121
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:57,400
Why?

122
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,200
To tell you the truth, I told her
that today was your birthday.

123
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,866
And I came here
for my precious fan.

124
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,533
Huh? Weren't you
a fan of Full Moon?

125
00:12:09,566 --> 00:12:13,200
Huh? Well, I like Full Moon,
but I also like Madoka.

126
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:16,766
Well, that's fine.
Oh yeah, yeah.

127
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:20,600
I have a birthday present
for you in this backpack.

128
00:12:22,766 --> 00:12:24,700
Wow, thank you very much.

129
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,200
Open it and take a look.

130
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:27,133
Okay.

131
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:28,700
This is...

132
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,366
It's a ticket for my concert
the day after tomorrow.

133
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:33,766
By the way, Full Moon will
also be performing.

134
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,033
It's the other way around!

135
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:37,566
You're performing in
Full Moon's concert.

136
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,233
She never changes.

137
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,200
I have ones for your friends too,
so all of you please come.

138
00:12:42,566 --> 00:12:45,566
Actually,
since we're fans of Full Moon...

139
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,466
- We already have tickets!
- We already have tickets!

140
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:49,200
What?!

141
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:52,833
Yeah, we all decided to go.

142
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,800
Then I'll give the tickets to
your Grandma and Ms. Tanaka.

143
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,733
I apologize, we also already...

144
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:03,200
It's my first show since
Fuyuko Komaki's dinner show.

145
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:05,233
Oh, what should I wear?

146
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,766
Now then, please give me your signature
on the surgery agreement.

147
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,366
Mitsuki, are you
all right with this?

148
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,833
Doctor, I will entrust
myself to you.

149
00:13:26,366 --> 00:13:27,666
Mitsuki, let's do our best.

150
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:28,800
Yes.

151
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,400
<i>I like you, Mitsuki.</i>

152
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:50,900
Eichi... What am I
supposed to do?

153
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,166
<i>Please forget about me.</i>
<i>You don't need to worry anymore.</i>

154
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:57,666
<i>You can just forget about it.</i>

155
00:13:58,566 --> 00:14:01,100
<i>Why did both of them</i>
<i>say the same thing?</i>

156
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,700
<i>But this feeling...</i>

157
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:13,366
Why do I feel the same way
as when Eichi said it?

158
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:18,966
I don't wanna. I can't forget
about either Eichi or Takuto.

159
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:22,866
Because Takuto is...

160
00:14:33,966 --> 00:14:37,700
One more day left.
At least tomorrow, I'll...

161
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:44,433
I see.

162
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:46,400
I don't understand
these kinds of feelings.

163
00:14:48,633 --> 00:14:50,433
How can I feel this way?

164
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:51,800
You can.

165
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,566
It's okay to feel that way.
I was the same too.

166
00:14:57,533 --> 00:15:02,566
When I was teamed up with Izumi,
I really liked him.

167
00:15:09,966 --> 00:15:13,933
At first, my feelings
didn't reach Izumi,

168
00:15:13,966 --> 00:15:17,400
but after confessing my love to him
over and over again, finally...

169
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,333
But Izumi never really
opened his heart.

170
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,866
<i>Division Chief, why?!</i>

171
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:35,333
<i>Why do I have to pair up</i>
<i>with this newcomer? I'm...</i>

172
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:39,833
<i>Izumi Lio...has requested</i>
<i>to disband from you.</i>

173
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,766
<i>Izumi! Why did you...</i>

174
00:15:48,566 --> 00:15:52,000
<i>A person's feelings are</i>
<i>unstable and unreliable.</i>

175
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:55,000
<i>That's why,</i>
<i>what you're saying...</i>

176
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,933
I thought that if I had to experience that,
I never wanted to be in love again.

177
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:08,900
However, when Takuto came around,
I started to like him.

178
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:13,466
Although in the end, my heart
was broken by Takuto as well.

179
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,900
No way.

180
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:18,933
It's okay.
I don't regret it at all.

181
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,633
I'm fine if Takuto is happy.

182
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,400
I bet Eichi feels the same way
about you too.

183
00:16:26,566 --> 00:16:27,566
Meroko...

184
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:33,133
Don't you like him? Why don't you be
more honest with your feelings?

185
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:35,733
But...

186
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:42,000
It doesn't mean
you'll forget Eichi at all.

187
00:16:42,633 --> 00:16:45,733
You're alive. Of course
a new romance will begin.

188
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,000
That's what it means to live.

189
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:55,533
What you have to do right now
is convey your true feeling.

190
00:16:56,633 --> 00:17:01,600
Takuto will surely understand
if you tell him the truth.

191
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:11,000
KOYAMA

192
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:12,800
Welcome home.

193
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:17,633
Izumi and Jonathan.

194
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:18,800
What do you want?

195
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,066
I was wondering
what happened.

196
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,633
Did you already have
Takuto drink it?

197
00:17:24,933 --> 00:17:27,866
No, but I'm going to talk
to him about it now.

198
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:29,700
Is that so?

199
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:32,533
Take care.

200
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,166
Izumi, you're not acting like yourself,
being so concerned about Mikki.

201
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,466
You think so?

202
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,866
Since some people
abandoned their work,

203
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,700
I wonder what's going to
happen to Mitsuki's fate.

204
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,966
Her fate probably
won't change though.

205
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,700
You think so?

206
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:03,800
Do you really think
that fate can't be changed?

207
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,500
What is that?

208
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,900
The Flower of Forgetfulness.

209
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:20,300
It's the only way for you
to not become a ghost.

210
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,533
The Flower of Forgetfulness?

211
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:25,266
If you drink this,
you'll forget all your memories.

212
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:26,666
What do you mean all?!

213
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,266
Memories from when
you were a human,

214
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,066
as well as after you
became a Death Spirit.

215
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,700
Y-You've got to be kidding.

216
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,100
But Takuto, if you don't drink it,
you'll become a ghost!

217
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:37,833
Stupid, I already told you!

218
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:40,766
I'm gonna be around until
your concert is over!

219
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:46,200
But I don't want you to become
a ghost even after the concert is over!

220
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:48,066
Mitsuki...

221
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,866
Takuto, please.

222
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,233
No, I'm definitely not
going to drink it.

223
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,100
Why would you go that far to
try to make me drink this?

224
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:05,833
Right now, I can touch
your hand like this.

225
00:19:08,366 --> 00:19:09,666
But if you became a ghost...

226
00:19:12,866 --> 00:19:16,000
I told you to forget
what I told you!

227
00:19:16,366 --> 00:19:18,633
Wasn't that how you really feel?

228
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:23,800
I also want you to
always be by my side.

229
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,433
I don't want to lose you.

230
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:28,533
I...

231
00:19:29,633 --> 00:19:32,933
If I can listen to your singing,
to Full Moon's singing, tomorrow,

232
00:19:32,966 --> 00:19:34,233
then that's fine.

233
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,800
Even if I become
a ghost after that.

234
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:40,466
I don't want that.
That's not fine at all!

235
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:44,066
Then it won't be Full Moon's
LIVE concert.

236
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:49,866
Doesn't live also mean "to live"?
That's what you taught me!

237
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:53,500
But then how can you be fine
with becoming a ghost?

238
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,200
This is your live concert. As long as
you have the passion to live...

239
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:00,466
You're wrong, Takuto.

240
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,933
Full Moon doesn't
just belong to me.

241
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:09,833
I was wondering for a long time
what Full Moon is.

242
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,100
And I finally figured it out.

243
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,933
Full Moon is a dream that
Takuto and I created.

244
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:19,566
Meroko, Ms. Oshige, and Dr. Wakaoji...

245
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,233
Everybody helped to
build this dream.

246
00:20:23,466 --> 00:20:28,600
You said it yourself. That you felt like
you were making music with me.

247
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,200
Full Moon is a dream that can't be
seen without you and me together.

248
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:39,300
Full Moon's live concert
won't be a live concert

249
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,633
unless we feel that
we need to live.

250
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,900
Mitsuki...

251
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:47,300
Takuto...
Let's live together.

252
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:51,900
Let's make tomorrow the first day
for the new you and me.

253
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,000
Yeah, you're right.

254
00:20:57,066 --> 00:21:00,600
Takuto... I like you.

255
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,166
Mitsuki, I...

256
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:25,200
Hey, Takuto, what are you doing here?
This is no time to be daydreaming.

257
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:26,300
Meroko...

258
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,833
There's no stopping now that
we've made it here.

259
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,900
We have to do
what we can do.

260
00:23:32,633 --> 00:23:35,166
Thanks, Meroko.
You're right.

261
00:23:35,766 --> 00:23:39,000
We have to prevent her from dying,
no matter what!

262
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,066
Yeah!

263
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:43,766
Next time on Full Moon:
"The Fated Day."

264
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,300
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
