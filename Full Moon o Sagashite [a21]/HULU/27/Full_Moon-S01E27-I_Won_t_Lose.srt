1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,933
After Dr. Wakaoji asked her what
she wanted to convey with "Eternal Snow,"

2
00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:12,700
Mitsuki found an old music box
inside the storage shed.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,933
It was a present that Mitsuki's father
gave to her mother a long time ago.

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,333
Takuto's Death Spirit Powers
revive the music box

5
00:00:19,366 --> 00:00:21,266
and the melody to
"Eternal Snow" comes out.

6
00:00:21,466 --> 00:00:24,700
After hearing this, Mitsuki discovers
her message.

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,800
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,600
Got that?

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,633
Yes.

10
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:11,333
In this week's guest corner,

11
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:14,400
we have in our studio
Full Moon and Madoka Wakamatsu,

12
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:18,566
who will be competing with
their renditions of "Eternal Snow."

13
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,000
How are you two doing?!

14
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:21,066
- Hello.
- Hello!

15
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,466
Wow, so cute!

16
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,666
What are you holding
on your chest, Madoka?

17
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:30,133
Yes, this is my friend,
Gu the piglet.

18
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:34,666
How cute that
a piglet is your friend.

19
00:02:35,466 --> 00:02:36,866
Thank you very much!

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,800
By the way, are you two doing
the recording on the same day

21
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,366
at the same studio
in this competition?

22
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:44,233
Yes.

23
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:46,066
Since it is the same song,

24
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,233
will they actually be
completely the same?

25
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:50,966
No, I believe that both the
arrangement and the image

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,500
will be very different.

27
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,433
Then, specifically,
how will it turn out?

28
00:02:57,366 --> 00:02:58,433
That is a secret.

29
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,166
Oh, that's too bad.

30
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:03,466
How is yours progressing,
Full Moon?

31
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,300
Is it secret with you too?

32
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:09,066
Oh, that's not the case at all.

33
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:12,566
Tell you the truth, there's nothing
to even keep a secret about.

34
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,200
Huh? Really?

35
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes. Actually, I haven't
been told anything.

36
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:20,233
Umm... Isn't your producer

37
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,600
a former member of Route L,
Mr. Oji?

38
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:26,966
Yes, Mr. Oji has only
told me to think very hard

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,400
about what I want to convey
in this song.

40
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,633
And what do you want to convey?

41
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,133
More than anything else,
I've been thinking

42
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:40,733
that I want to warm people's
hearts with music.

43
00:03:40,866 --> 00:03:43,200
I see, to warm hearts.

44
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,833
Maybe that is Mr. Oji's goal.

45
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:47,566
What? Do you think so?

46
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:56,800
Thank you very much
for your hard work!

47
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,333
Thank you very much!

48
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:06,033
Miss Sasaki, what was
with today's interview?

49
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:10,100
Wasn't my part short compared
to Full Moon's?!

50
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,266
Sorry, with the appearance of Oji,
the director suddenly...

51
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,833
The appearance of Oji?

52
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,866
<i>Does Oji draw that much</i>
<i>more attention than Mr. Takasu?</i>

53
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,966
Miss Wakamatsu!

54
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,100
Do you have some time?

55
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,466
Excuse me! Please stop it.

56
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,133
Didn't I tell you that we're not going
to take your magazine's coverage?

57
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:32,800
Umm... What's happening?

58
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,233
Everything's fine, Madoka.

59
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:38,433
He's from a tabloid magazine that
writes about scandals of young talents

60
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,533
and he's our enemy, so to speak!

61
00:04:40,566 --> 00:04:44,066
That's rude, do you need
to say it to that extent?!

62
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:47,866
There are even stars that have
had their careers killed off

63
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,466
because of things written up in
this magazine, which were all lies!

64
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,133
<i>Careers killed off?</i>

65
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,466
Miss Sasaki! Do you have some time?

66
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:56,533
Yes!

67
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,033
Now, let's go!

68
00:04:58,233 --> 00:04:59,200
Oh, yes.

69
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,066
Huh?

70
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:08,766
If you have any interesting
material related to stars,

71
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,433
I welcome it anytime.

72
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,366
I'll make sure to show my gratitude.
Okay, see you later!

73
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:20,166
Madoka? Hurry up
and come over here!

74
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:21,166
Oh, yes!

75
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:36,733
Mr. Oji, isn't it about time
to allow Full Moon to sing?

76
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:39,500
No, it's not that time yet.

77
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:40,666
Why?

78
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:42,466
Do you need a reason?

79
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:47,133
But Madoka Wakamatsu's side seems
to be rapidly progressing with their plan.

80
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,600
It doesn't matter.

81
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:54,733
Mr. Oji, don't you think the
staff is feeling dissatisfied too?

82
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,133
Full Moon surely feels that way too.

83
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,700
Schedule time is being taken
up for the preparation,

84
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:02,100
but she hasn't been allowed
to sing at all.

85
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:04,633
If she doesn't at least
do some warming up,

86
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,266
she won't suddenly be able to sing
in the actual take.

87
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,166
Do you think so?

88
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,833
What?

89
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:12,400
Don't worry. Please leave it to me.

90
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:15,700
Oh...

91
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:18,100
Mr. Oji...

92
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,433
Don't you want to sing soon, Mitsuki?

93
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:27,200
Yes.

94
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:32,166
<i>I wonder if the recording</i>
<i>is really going to be all right?</i>

95
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:40,233
<i>I love you, my tears won't stop.</i>

96
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:44,366
<i>If this is how it's going to be,</i>

97
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,100
<i>I wish I had never met you</i>

98
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:50,633
It's no good, stop it.

99
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:51,366
Yes sir.

100
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,566
What's wrong, Madoka?

101
00:06:58,666 --> 00:06:59,766
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,733
You're not being yourself.

103
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:05,033
I fell in love with the
Madoka Wakamatsu

104
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,066
who's filled with more
self-confidence and dignity.

105
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,333
Yes, thank you very much.

106
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,400
Get back your usual self
by the main take.

107
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,000
Do you understand?

108
00:07:23,366 --> 00:07:25,800
Did you hear the story about
Full Moon's new song?

109
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:26,866
Huh? What, what?

110
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:29,933
After Mr. Oji signed
on as a producer,

111
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:33,033
many famous musicians
have asked to participate in it

112
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:35,666
and it's going to be
an awesome line-up!

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,333
Wow, is that true?

114
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,466
Then isn't Madoka Wakamatsu
in trouble?

115
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,200
It seems like Mr. Takasu is
going to completely lose face.

116
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:44,733
Oops! Hush!

117
00:07:59,933 --> 00:08:02,433
<i>What on earth am I doing wrong?</i>

118
00:08:02,866 --> 00:08:06,333
<i>I don't understand what</i>
<i>Mr. Takasu is demanding from me.</i>

119
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:07,500
Huh?

120
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,633
Didn't I tell you not
to nestle close to me

121
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,566
when people are not looking?!

122
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:21,400
I'm only keeping you for
my image as a gentle, animal loving girl!

123
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,166
If you don't stop it,

124
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
I'll change your name
to "Yummy-looking."

125
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,466
Oh, darn it!

126
00:08:34,466 --> 00:08:36,033
<i>I'm going to lose if it</i>
<i>stays like this.</i>

127
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,200
<i>What should I do?</i>

128
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,166
<i>Oh...</i>

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,333
<i>If you have any interesting material,</i>
<i>I welcome it anytime.</i>

130
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,500
<i>There are even stars that</i>
<i>have had their careers killed off.</i>

131
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,966
Hello?

132
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,366
Is this Mr. Yomitani?

133
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,466
That doctor!

134
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,766
I wonder why he called you
out all of a sudden.

135
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:28,866
I don't know. Maybe it's time
for him to finally let me sing.

136
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:29,966
That's possible.

137
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,566
Mitsuki!

138
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:44,266
Dr. Wakaoji, I'm sorry I was late!

139
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,900
That's fine, but what did
you need to talk to me about?

140
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:51,833
I came here because I was told
that you needed to talk to me.

141
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:55,800
What? I came here because
I was called out by you.

142
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,400
I was also told to come here.

143
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,133
Who was that guy?

144
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
What was that just now?

145
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,233
That's gonna be a problem.

146
00:10:13,466 --> 00:10:15,133
What? What do you
mean by "a problem"?

147
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,033
Anyhow, we should contact Ms. Oshige.

148
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,933
Who cares about the director?

149
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:33,066
I have my own circumstances over here!

150
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Old man, one more drink!

151
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:36,600
Yes!

152
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,733
I'm not getting through to her.

153
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:41,933
Dr. Wakaoji? What has happened?

154
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:45,800
Listen to what I say carefully.

155
00:10:46,966 --> 00:10:47,700
All right?

156
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:49,300
Yes...

157
00:11:13,433 --> 00:11:15,800
Maybe I drank a bit
too much last night.

158
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:20,133
<i>It's this morning's</i>

00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,933
Wow, what is this?!

176
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:06,233
Isn't this it?

177
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:08,100
The thing they were showing
on TV this morning.

178
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:11,333
Yeah, yeah. Full Moon is
going out with the producer.

179
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:13,266
What? That's so shocking!

180
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:14,833
Hey, we're going.

181
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:15,833
Okay.

182
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:17,066
And I liked her so much!

183
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:20,366
What was that?
Did you actually have a photo taken?

184
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,200
Yeah.

185
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:23,400
Wait a minute! Isn't that bad?

186
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:24,300
Yeah.

187
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:25,933
But...

188
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,800
<i>What happened just now</i>
<i>is like an accident</i>

189
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:34,166
<i>that a young female singer</i>
<i>like you comes across now and then.</i>

190
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:36,466
<i>Even if you're being careful,</i>

191
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,033
<i>an accident just happens</i>
<i>when it happens.</i>

192
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,333
<i>You're not the one at fault.</i>
<i>Neither am I.</i>

193
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:42,600
<i>We just had a little bad luck.</i>

194
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:45,566
<i>People forget about</i>
<i>silly rumors quickly.</i>

195
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,800
<i>But you might need</i>
<i>some perseverance until then.</i>

196
00:12:50,933 --> 00:12:53,800
<i>Mitsuki, do you think</i>
<i>you can handle it?</i>

197
00:12:55,766 --> 00:12:56,533
<i>Yes.</i>

198
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:01,433
<i>Good, I'll be with you.</i>
<i>You don't need to worry.</i>

199
00:13:01,966 --> 00:13:02,700
<i>Yes!</i>

200
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:06,600
So that's what happened.

201
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:09,533
He's surprisingly dependable.

202
00:13:09,766 --> 00:13:15,900
Yes. I felt really glad that I asked
Dr. Wakaoji to produce for me.

203
00:13:16,633 --> 00:13:17,600
I think so too.

204
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,933
<i>He is really an adult.</i>

205
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:21,833
<i>To tell the truth,</i>

206
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:24,600
<i>I didn't know what to</i>
<i>say at that time.</i>

207
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:29,433
What is this?
Isn't this a lack of oversight?

208
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,566
I-I'm sorry.

209
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:33,800
First of all, I don't care
if it is Oji or whoever,

210
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,100
but is the recording actually
going to be done?

211
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:42,633
If I don't hear some material soon,
I won't know what to tell Mr. Miyata.

212
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:44,900
Yes. That's...

213
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,633
SCOOP!
WE DELVE INTO
FULL MOON'S PRIVATE LIFE

214
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,066
<i>Will I be able to let go of</i>
<i>these thoughts of you?</i>

215
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:04,333
<i>Hold me tight,</i>
<i>if this is how it feels</i>

216
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,400
<i>to fall in love with someone,</i>

217
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:12,033
<i>I wish I never knew.</i>

218
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:18,466
<i>I love you,</i>
<i>my tears won't stop.</i>

219
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,633
<i>If this is how it's going to be</i>

220
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:30,066
<i>I wish I had never met you.</i>

221
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,900
Umm... Mr. Takasu?

222
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:43,566
Huh? Oh yeah.

223
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:45,666
<i>How was my singing?</i>

224
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:49,133
There's something that weighs
on my mind, no matter what.

225
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:49,933
<i>Huh?</i>

226
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:51,933
Let's end it here for today.

227
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,300
Mr. Takasu?

228
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,466
I really want to sing this one song.

229
00:15:41,366 --> 00:15:44,666
<i>Grandma, please make sure</i>
<i>to listen to my song someday.</i>

230
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,066
<i>And please come to like,</i>
<i>even a little bit,</i>

231
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,266
<i>music that you've hated for so long.</i>

232
00:15:57,766 --> 00:15:59,900
TODAY'S RECORDING SCHEDULE:
A. FULL MOON 1:00 - 6:00
B. MADOKA WAKAMATSU 1:00 - 8:00
There's a huge group of reporters.

233
00:15:59,933 --> 00:16:03,666
That's because it's right after
Full Moon had that kind of a scandal.

234
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,800
Mr. Oji seems to have
already entered.

235
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,133
Will Full Moon come?

236
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,966
Well, don't you think it's impossible?

237
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,600
There's even a rumor that
the release is going to be postponed.

238
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,633
What?! Is that true?

239
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,666
Good morning!

240
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:19,900
What? She's here?

241
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,800
Hello, I look for your guidance today.

242
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,633
Oh? Yes...me too.

243
00:16:32,566 --> 00:16:34,433
<i>Hey, how do you feel?</i>

244
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:37,966
I have so much desire
to sing right now,

245
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,633
I feel like my chest is
going to burst open!

246
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,233
Good, then let's begin.

247
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:03,466
<i>The emotion that piled up inside me</i>
<i>while I didn't sing all that time...</i>

248
00:17:04,433 --> 00:17:08,966
<i>I hope this song will warm</i>
<i>the hearts of people who listen to it.</i>

249
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,266
<i>I hope they are wrapped up</i>
<i>by a warm happiness.</i>

250
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:22,733
<i>How long has it been</i>
<i>since I fell in love with you?</i>

251
00:17:23,566 --> 00:17:31,833
<i>My feelings keep getting stronger.</i>

252
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:40,933
<i>I wonder if you can notice them?</i>

253
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:43,400
<i>Even though</i>

254
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:46,166
- Can it be that...
- <i>I've never mentioned it,</i>

255
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,866
<i>I've never mentioned it,</i>

256
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:58,766
<i>they're silent like this snow.</i>

257
00:17:59,366 --> 00:18:01,433
<i>But they...</i>

258
00:18:01,466 --> 00:18:06,066
You planned it like this...
by not having her sing until now.

259
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,733
<i>...keep building up.</i>

260
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,233
You really feel Full Moon's desire

261
00:18:11,266 --> 00:18:14,400
- to sing the song.
<i>- Hold me tight,</i>

262
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:17,233
- I became quite nervous, but...
<i>- if loving someone</i>

263
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:25,633
<i>was going to feel like this,</i>

264
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,966
<i>I wish I never found out about love.</i>

265
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:35,900
<i>I love you, my tears won't stop.</i>

266
00:18:35,933 --> 00:18:37,433
Where is Mr. Takasu?

267
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,000
- He's late.
<i>- If this is how it's going to be,</i>

268
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:42,066
- Good morning, sir!
- Good morning, sir!

269
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:43,666
<i>I wish I never</i>

270
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,866
- Mr. Takasu...
<i>- I wish I never</i>

271
00:18:44,866 --> 00:18:47,100
- I look forward to your guidance today!
<i>- found out about love.</i>

272
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,033
- Then let's begin at once.
<i>- found out about love.</i>

273
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:50,600
Madoka, be on stand-by.

274
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:51,400
Yes...

275
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,866
Madoka!

276
00:18:54,966 --> 00:18:55,500
Yes!

277
00:18:56,066 --> 00:18:57,000
Please come over here.

278
00:18:57,966 --> 00:18:58,666
Yes.

279
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,300
I thought about doing it
after the recording,

280
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,033
but I wanted to take it upon
myself to talk to you about it now.

281
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,000
Yes.

282
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,433
Do you not believe in me?

283
00:19:12,766 --> 00:19:13,266
What?

284
00:19:15,533 --> 00:19:17,466
I heard about the story
from the editorial staff.

285
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:19,633
Umm... There is a reason for this.

286
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:20,333
Reason?

287
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,900
Umm... Well, I mean...

288
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,000
What kind of reason is there?

289
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:32,166
In this world, no matter what
kind of dirty thing you do,

290
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:34,366
the one who's standing
in the end is the winner.

291
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:37,566
I won't make a pretty statement like
saying that what you did is dirty.

292
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,533
But you don't believe in me.

293
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,233
That's...

294
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,166
I believed in you.

295
00:19:46,366 --> 00:19:47,000
Huh?

296
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,133
I told you before.

297
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,933
I can only work with somebody
who believes in my skill.

298
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,533
I intend to settle what happened
this time in my own way.

299
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,066
What do you—?

300
00:19:58,266 --> 00:20:00,400
We will perform the recording
as planned.

301
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,333
But after today,
I will step down from producing you.

302
00:20:23,366 --> 00:20:25,866
<i>I believed in you.</i>

303
00:20:40,466 --> 00:20:41,800
What in the world happened?

304
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:42,966
I have no idea.

305
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,233
Madoka...

306
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,100
Oh, Mr. Takasu...

307
00:20:48,433 --> 00:20:50,766
What happened with
Madoka Wakamatsu?

308
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:52,700
I'm sorry, Ms. Oshige.

309
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:56,966
Mr. Takasu...

310
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:58,600
Madoka...

311
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:04,933
You should think hard one more time
about the reason why you want to sing.

312
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:09,166
That's all I can say.

313
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,000
<i>You should think hard one more time</i>
<i>about the reason why you want to sing.</i>

314
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,200
The reason why I want to sing.

315
00:21:35,566 --> 00:21:38,666
If I don't know that reason,

316
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,366
will I be unable to sing
like she was?

317
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:24,266
The time's finally come for Meroko
to put on a stellar performance!

318
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,300
Okay, okay.
So what's it this time?

319
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,466
A school friend of Mitsuki
is confused

320
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,700
and decided that she's
an expert in the matters of love

321
00:23:30,733 --> 00:23:32,533
and is asking her for advice!

322
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:35,866
Huh? How could she
be an expert in love?

323
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,400
Right? And so it's now time
for me to help out!

324
00:23:39,766 --> 00:23:41,433
That is a bit weird too!

325
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:46,166
Next time on Full Moon:
"Is Mitsuki an Expert on Love?"

326
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,433
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
