1
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:07,600
Meet Mitsuki Koyama,
12 years old.

2
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:10,700
Sadly, her life will last only
until next spring.

3
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:14,566
Although we were sent to make certain
that her destiny didn't change,

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,433
we ended up transforming her
into a 16-year-old girl, Full Moon.

5
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:21,200
Mitsuki somehow managed to make

6
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:24,133
her doctor and manager
believe the story.

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,800
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

8
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:33,600
Got that?

9
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:34,700
Yes.

10
00:02:17,366 --> 00:02:18,000
Huh?

11
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,200
What's that?

12
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,600
You haven't forgotten anything?

13
00:03:04,633 --> 00:03:05,533
No!

14
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,733
It's good that you're being released
from the hospital so soon.

15
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,200
Please, come in.

16
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:14,800
Oh, Dr. Wakaoji!

17
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,066
Thank you for taking such
good care of us.

18
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,300
O-Of course.

19
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,400
Mrs. Koyama also said to
give you her thanks.

20
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,700
Is that so?

21
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,700
How do you feel?

22
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,733
I feel great!

23
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:29,733
Doctor, thank you for everything.

24
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:36,833
Still, keep your transformation
a secret from your grandmother, okay?

25
00:03:36,866 --> 00:03:38,066
Ah, yes.

26
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:39,266
And...

27
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:41,066
Him too.

28
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,133
Y-Yes.

29
00:03:42,866 --> 00:03:44,533
Well then, take care of yourself.

30
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:49,366
Oh, Dr. Wakaoji, once our preparations
are done, we'll come say goodbye to you.

31
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:53,166
Oh no, I have an examination now,
so please don't bother.

32
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,300
It seems like that doctor doesn't like me.

33
00:03:58,466 --> 00:04:00,233
N-No way! That's your imagination!

34
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,666
Well, I guess it can't be helped
if he doesn't like me.

35
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:05,733
I'm a Death Spirit,
he's a doctor.

36
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,766
I was surprised by how much
your grandmother was worried about you.

37
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,166
Oh really?

38
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:22,266
<i>Grandma...
She's that concerned about me?</i>

39
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,400
You should think about how
you inconvenienced others!

40
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,433
Starting with Dr. Wakaoji,

41
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:32,633
then the nurses, everyone was so busy,
but they're looking for you!

42
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,300
I'm so sorry!

43
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,733
Indeed... Be careful from now on.

44
00:04:44,766 --> 00:04:47,066
Umm... Grandma, how are you feeling?

45
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:51,533
The heat got to me a bit.
There's no need to worry.

46
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,533
I see.

47
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:56,333
Excuse me.

48
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,866
<i>Congratulations on your release
from the hospital, Mitsuki.</i>

49
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,333
Thank you, Ms. Oshige.

50
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:07,633
<i>You can work again after
you've settled down a bit.</i>

51
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:08,900
Thank you.

52
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:12,766
And remember, you'll have to make
some apologies when you return.

53
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,666
<i>Yes.</i>

54
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,833
<i>Well, I'll be in touch.</i>

55
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:16,966
Okay.

56
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,500
Hey, ya little brat!

57
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:21,933
Why isn't there an air conditioner
in this room!

58
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,533
Because it's not good for my throat.

59
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:27,000
Besides, we're elevated,
so there's a breeze. Isn't it cool?

60
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:29,433
It's not cool!

61
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,633
More importantly...

62
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,200
I wonder what Meroko is doing.

63
00:05:35,766 --> 00:05:36,566
I don't know.

64
00:05:37,266 --> 00:05:39,300
Takuto, are you still angry?

65
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,300
Hey? Aren't you angry?

66
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,966
It's her fault that you didn't
make the audition!

67
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:47,766
I'm sure that Meroko had
her own reasons.

68
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,266
Th-That's true.
But it's Meroko's fault that you...

69
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,300
But, thanks to her, I was able to tell
Dr. Wakaoji and Ms.Oshige the truth.

70
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,933
Y-Yeah well...

71
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:02,100
All that's left is for Meroko
to come home.

72
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:07,100
Meroko... I wonder where she went.

73
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:17,466
I didn't do anything wrong!

74
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:23,366
I only fulfilled my duty as
a Death Spirit!

75
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,366
What's wrong with that?!

76
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:53,533
That stupid Takuto!

77
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:08,000
Hello.

78
00:07:08,566 --> 00:07:09,600
Yes, yes.

79
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,700
W-What is it?

80
00:07:16,366 --> 00:07:17,566
Is Mitsuki home?

81
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:18,466
Yes.

82
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,266
We all came to visit her!

83
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,900
We were surprised to hear
you were in the hospital.

84
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:27,033
But we're glad you've gotten better.

85
00:07:27,133 --> 00:07:28,466
Yes. Thank you.

86
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,700
Wow, your garden is big!

87
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,200
You even have a pond!
That's awesome!

88
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:35,166
Hey, can I go look a little bit?

89
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:35,900
Sure.

90
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:41,000
Ms. Tanaka.

91
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:42,300
Ma'am...

92
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:43,900
Do we have guests?

93
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,100
Yes, they are all Mitsuki's friends.

94
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,566
This is the first time so many
have come to visit.

95
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,933
I'm surprised.

96
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:56,366
What?! A school ghost story?

97
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:59,400
They say it appeared in
the gym of our school!

98
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:00,500
No way!

99
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:04,400
At night, when nobody is in the gym...

100
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:06,200
a basketball...

101
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,266
S-Stop it!

102
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,066
I have a thing about stuff like that.

103
00:08:13,466 --> 00:08:14,733
Mitsuki's a chicken.

104
00:08:14,766 --> 00:08:16,433
With only this much.

105
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:18,000
But...

106
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:20,433
I'm sure that ghost is lonely.

107
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,400
So it's waiting for someone to
come and play with it.

108
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:24,266
What?!

109
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:26,933
After all, you can't play basketball alone.

110
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:28,900
- You sure can't!
- You sure can't!

111
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:32,000
<i>Could that, by any chance, be...</i>

112
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,733
<i>Meroko?</i>

113
00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:43,466
Don't bother coming out.

114
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,200
Don't overdo it.

115
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,633
Okay, thank you for coming today.

116
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,166
See you again!

117
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,266
- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!

118
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,300
What a dreadful experience!

119
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,066
Hey, Takuto.

120
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,366
Huh? What is it?

121
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:59,000
It's about Meroko.

122
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:00,466
You're still talking about that?!

123
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,566
Meroko might be at school.

124
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,000
I don't want to hear it!

125
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:05,966
Oh, Takuto!

126
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Jeez!

127
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,066
I'm tired of it already.

128
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:35,966
Are you here, Meroko?!

129
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:39,400
Oh, shoot!

130
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:43,266
Oh, I can't get out!

131
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,700
Are you okay, Meroko?

132
00:09:45,566 --> 00:09:47,066
I'm fine.

133
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,466
What? Takuto didn't say anything?

134
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,266
That's right, he wouldn't tell
me even when I asked.

135
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,233
Th-The reason is...
The reason is...

136
00:09:58,133 --> 00:10:00,100
It's okay if you don't want to say it.

137
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,266
It's just...

138
00:10:03,533 --> 00:10:05,900
Without you, Meroko, it's like...

139
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,333
There's something missing,
like something's different.

140
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:11,633
When it's not the three of us...

141
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:14,900
If it's not the three of us like before,
it's lonely.

142
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,066
So, let's go home together!

143
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:56,100
I want to go home too.

144
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,066
I want to go home, but Takuto...

145
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,333
I think that deep down
Takuto wants you to come home.

146
00:11:02,766 --> 00:11:03,733
You think so?.

147
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:10,133
<i>It's okay with me if
you don't come home!</i>

148
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,100
<i>Why!</i>

149
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:14,066
<i>Because, I got to be
alone with her at last.</i>

150
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,200
<i>In short, you're</i>

151
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,500
<i>in the way!</i>

152
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,633
I-It's no good!
Takuto prefers it without me!

153
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:23,500
What?

154
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,500
Anyway, I can't go. See you!

155
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:28,200
Meroko!

156
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:31,733
Jeez...

157
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:49,200
Jeez! It's hot.

158
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,233
So hot!

159
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,100
I'm hot.

160
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:58,933
R-Rejected!

161
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,800
Hey, I haven't said anything yet.

162
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,933
Anyway, it's going to be
about Meroko, right?

163
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:05,166
Oh, you know?

164
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,900
Umm... I want you to go and get Meroko.

165
00:12:08,266 --> 00:12:09,400
Now she's at school.

166
00:12:09,433 --> 00:12:13,133
Listen, why do I have to go
and get her?

167
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,766
If she wants to come home,
she can come home herself.

168
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,933
What?! She can?

169
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:21,966
Th-That's Meroko's problem.
Why should I care?

170
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,900
I see. Yes, that's right.

171
00:12:25,966 --> 00:12:27,500
W-Wait a minute!

172
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,666
Did Takuto really say it was okay?

173
00:12:29,866 --> 00:12:30,633
That's what he said!

174
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:32,300
B-But...

175
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,933
Come on!

176
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,966
But I don't know what
to say to Takuto.

177
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,433
You can say, "I'm back!"

178
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,966
But I don't think Takuto will say,
"Welcome back."

179
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,633
Not that again.

180
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,700
At this rate,
things will stay like this forever.

181
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:49,966
Is that okay?

182
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,866
It's...not good, but...

183
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,700
Wow, the sky is so blue!

184
00:12:58,733 --> 00:13:00,433
And the clouds are so white!

185
00:13:00,566 --> 00:13:01,533
It's beautiful.

186
00:13:01,766 --> 00:13:03,300
Hey Takuto, come look!

187
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:04,700
I'm not interested.

188
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:06,300
Besides, for Spirits of Death,

189
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,800
it doesn't matter if the sky is blue
or the clouds are white!

190
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,466
Oh, is that so?

191
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:11,866
Yes, that's so!

192
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,766
Meroko, come here!

193
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:22,900
Jeez!

194
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:31,933
The both of you!

195
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,833
Hello, Tomoe?

196
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:37,666
This is just a hypothetical question.

197
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:42,733
What do you think you should do
to help good friends make up?

198
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:45,233
An opportunity.

199
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,266
<i>An opportunity? What kind?</i>

200
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,066
Anything is fine.

201
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,933
If you create an opportunity

202
00:13:50,966 --> 00:13:52,566
<i>after that it's up to them.</i>

203
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,100
An opportunity...

204
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:56,000
Mitsuki.

205
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,233
How long do you plan to
be on the phone?

206
00:13:59,866 --> 00:14:02,633
Long phone calls are troublesome
to the other party.

207
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:03,766
Y-Yes.

208
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,300
Hello, Tomoe?

209
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,666
That's fine.

210
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,400
Really? Thank you very much!

211
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:19,400
Just be careful about starting a fire.

212
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,300
Prepare a bucket full of water.

213
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,233
Yes!

214
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,333
Excuse me!

215
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:28,166
Fireworks with friends...
That sounds like fun!

216
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:30,300
Oh, please excuse me.

217
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:31,866
I got excited despite myself.

218
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:34,633
There's nothing to apologize for.

219
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:36,266
Yes, that's true.

220
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:41,300
Oh, shall we do something nice
for the children?

221
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,800
Do as you please.

222
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:43,600
Yes!

223
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,566
Fireworks with Death Spirit power?!

224
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,833
Yeah, I prepared
a fireworks set anyway.

225
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,266
But I want really big ones.

226
00:14:58,066 --> 00:14:59,366
That's fine.

227
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,866
Please.

228
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:03,466
Fireworks with Death Spirit power?!

229
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,966
Yeah! I want big flashy ones.

230
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:09,166
Hmm... Well okay.

231
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,200
Hello.

232
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,800
Oh, come in.

233
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,633
- Good evening.
- Please excuse me.

234
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,866
Good evening. Mitsuki's waiting.

235
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,366
Well, come this way.

236
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,166
W-What's this?

237
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,000
It's streaming somen noodle!

238
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:32,066
Yes, please eat all you like.

239
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,766
- Wow!
- How wonderful!

240
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,766
It feels so quiet and elegant!

241
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:38,233
Hey, hey, ginger goes with somen.

242
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:39,933
What? I like mayonnaise dressing.

243
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:43,066
Welcome!

244
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,900
Oh, Mitsuki!

245
00:15:45,066 --> 00:15:46,433
Cute!

246
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:47,500
Lovely!

247
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:49,266
You look pretty, Mitsuki.

248
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:50,566
R-Really?

249
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:52,866
Thank you for inviting us today.

250
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,866
Don't mention it.

251
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,700
Everyone, I'm going to start
streaming the somen now.

252
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:57,866
Okay!

253
00:16:00,366 --> 00:16:01,366
Caught it!

254
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:03,500
Oh, I missed it.

255
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:17,966
It's lit!

256
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:21,133
Light this one too!

257
00:16:44,233 --> 00:16:45,866
<i>I wonder if things will work out.</i>

258
00:16:53,933 --> 00:16:55,133
- Oh no!
- No!

259
00:16:57,366 --> 00:16:59,000
Everyone, this way!

260
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:03,066
R-Rain, at a time like this?

261
00:17:19,633 --> 00:17:22,366
It's unlucky...for it to rain.

262
00:17:22,466 --> 00:17:23,433
No worries.

263
00:17:23,466 --> 00:17:25,466
It's just a shower, it'll stop soon.

264
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,033
I hope so.

265
00:17:27,933 --> 00:17:30,600
But isn't it great
that you made a lot of friends?

266
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:33,433
Yes, thanks to you,
Takuto and Meroko.

267
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:35,533
You know, when my CD came out...

268
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,100
There were times like that.

269
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,066
And I wondered
what was going to happen

270
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,833
when Meroko transformed into me and
made a bargain sale of the CD's.

271
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:54,333
That really got me.

272
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:56,533
But that was good.

273
00:17:56,933 --> 00:17:57,633
Yeah.

274
00:17:58,233 --> 00:18:02,000
You're trying to bring the conversation
around to Meroko, aren't you?

275
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Saw through me?

276
00:18:05,966 --> 00:18:06,933
Well, that's okay.

277
00:18:07,566 --> 00:18:12,633
But when I got out of the orphanage,
you and Meroko were my first friends.

278
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:18,400
That's why, the two of you are
such important friends to me.

279
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:22,833
I want you to make up.

280
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,200
- Oh, the rain stopped!
- Lucky!

281
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:36,333
We can continue
the fireworks!

282
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,066
Let's do it!

283
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,933
<i>Hazuki...</i>

284
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,866
Let's do fireworks that shoot in the sky!

285
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,300
Yeah. Let's do it.

286
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,366
All right!

287
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:23,500
Now!

288
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:24,300
- Go!
- Go!

289
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:34,966
Oh, that's cute!

290
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,733
It's a rabbit and a cat!

291
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,300
W-What's that?!

292
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,100
I only did a rabbit.

293
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,366
That girl...

294
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,466
I get it.

295
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:53,933
Hey, Meroko!

296
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:57,666
Takuto...I...

297
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,200
You can't...forgive me.

298
00:20:03,433 --> 00:20:04,300
Well...

299
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,233
Wait!

300
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:08,233
Don't just decide how other people
are feeling by yourself.

301
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,333
So, do you forgive me?

302
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,266
That thing.
Let's do that thing.

303
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,500
- Huh?
- Yeah.

304
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,066
Yeah!

305
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,400
It's presumptuous to ask who we are!

306
00:20:21,766 --> 00:20:25,066
It's us! The Death Spirit duo
who fools crying kids!

307
00:20:25,366 --> 00:20:26,100
Takuto!

308
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:27,200
Meroko!

309
00:20:27,233 --> 00:20:30,500
Together we are,
Green Onion Ramen!

310
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,600
Wow!

311
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,800
Look at that!

312
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:38,500
I'm so glad.

313
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,900
What, Mitsuki?

314
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,366
Oh, so glad...

315
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,466
So glad that they have
green onion ramen fireworks!

316
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,466
Or something.

317
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,533
What are you saying, Mitsuki?

318
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,133
What am I saying?
I wonder...

319
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,733
- Good night.
- Good night!

320
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,066
Be careful!

321
00:21:03,466 --> 00:21:04,266
Mitsuki.

322
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,700
Did everyone return home
after having fun?

323
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,600
Yes.

324
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,400
That's good.

325
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:18,266
But Mitsuki, you're still recuperating so,
get warm and go to bed soon.

326
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:19,266
Oh, yes.

327
00:21:19,566 --> 00:21:20,433
That's all.

328
00:21:21,633 --> 00:21:22,500
Grandma...

329
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:24,166
What is it?

330
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:27,300
Thank you for always being
concerned about me.

331
00:21:32,066 --> 00:21:33,366
Takuto! Meroko!

332
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:36,700
I have a feeling
that from now on,

333
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,766
Grandma and I are going
to get along just fine!

334
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,400
Is that right?

335
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,433
Of course!

336
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:20,666
Man! I'm so frustrated!

337
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,166
That girl came back...
Madoka Wakamatsu!

338
00:23:23,366 --> 00:23:27,066
Hey! Why do you always
make her an enemy?

339
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,133
She might actually
be a nice person.

340
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,366
She can't be!

341
00:23:30,466 --> 00:23:34,400
I'm sure she's the one
who destroyed Mitsuki's costume!

342
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:36,866
Anyway, this is no time
to be talking about that!

343
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,133
She's returning to work for the first time
since her release from the hospital.

344
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,833
We have to support her.

345
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:44,533
Next time on Full Moon:
"A New Inspiration."

346
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:46,200
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
