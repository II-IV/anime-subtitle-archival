1
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:06,633
Why did this happen?!

2
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:10,333
The event site for Full Moon's live
performance was suddenly unavailable!

3
00:00:10,433 --> 00:00:13,733
It seems someone claimed to be a
staff member and cancelled it!

4
00:00:13,766 --> 00:00:16,166
Unfortunately, the performance
was to be cancelled too!

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,000
However, by transforming a ship
into a stage,

6
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:20,366
the performance became a success.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,233
Full Moon shined brilliantly
on the last night of summer vacation!

8
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,666
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

9
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:33,666
Got that?

10
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:34,666
Yes.

11
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:19,000
<i>Why do I like you?</i>

12
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:28,866
<i>That's too easy to answer.</i>

13
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:32,800
When is this gonna
be over?!

14
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:35,166
Hurry, hurry...

15
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,666
What's up with you two?

16
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,966
Do you have to pee?

17
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:53,100
<i>Okay.</i>

18
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:54,766
<i>Good work, Full Moon.</i>

19
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,766
Oh, okay.
Thank you very much.

20
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,733
Okay, it's over!

21
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,466
Thank you!

22
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,866
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

23
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:07,466
Ms. Oshige, let's go home.

24
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,366
Huh?! H-Hey!

25
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:12,700
What's the matter?
Explain!

26
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:14,433
Hadn't she mentioned it?

27
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:17,166
These days her people
are really strict!

28
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,133
You're home way past
your curfew.

29
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:22,500
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,666
Even if you were
visiting friends,

31
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,966
you would bother them
if you overstayed your visit.

32
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:30,466
Please be careful from now on.

33
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,000
Yes, ma'am.

34
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,200
All right, gotta go shopping.

35
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,333
Dr. Wakaoji...

36
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:56,733
You're so cute.

37
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,666
<i>Hello, Mitsuki?</i>

38
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,333
Yes... Good morning.

39
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,900
<i>Hey Mitsuki,
what are you doing today?</i>

40
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:05,700
Huh?

41
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,933
I was playing with the accessories

42
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:09,866
from the live performance
the other day.

43
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Is it work?

44
00:04:11,766 --> 00:04:13,766
<i>No, not work.
It's just...</i>

45
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,000
Huh? What is it?

46
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,333
<i>Can you guess?</i>

47
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:19,833
Come on!
What is it?

48
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,133
Why don't you come
on out?

49
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:25,366
I'm right here in the neighborhood.

50
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,733
<i>Oh, if possible could you bring
Takuto and Meroko along?</i>

51
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:29,700
<i>See you soon.</i>

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Hello, hello?
Ms. Oshige?

53
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,000
Hello...

54
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:37,566
You moved here?!

55
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:38,366
That's right!

56
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:42,300
I thought that if I lived
close by

57
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,300
it would make it easier
for you to go out, Mitsuki.

58
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,833
That makes sense.

59
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,866
You sure are a great manager!

60
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:50,333
Thanks.

61
00:04:51,933 --> 00:04:53,700
Um... Where do you want this?

62
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,900
Oh, please put it in
that room.

63
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,266
Please put that in
the corner over there.

64
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,833
Okay.

65
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,266
This is a pretty big place.

66
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:04,433
Making money, right, Manager?

67
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:08,400
Huh? The rent is nothing
compared to mid-city.

68
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,333
Oh, really?

69
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:14,766
This will let me back you up
even more than ever, Mitsuki!

70
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:17,133
If I have this much room,

71
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,966
I can set a room aside
just for you, Mitsuki.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,833
For me?!

73
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:21,333
Yes.

74
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:25,300
For example, this room could
be set aside

75
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,333
just for your singing lessons.

76
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,533
Or it could be a private room
for when you write lyrics.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,200
Wow!

78
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:33,866
Oh!

79
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,100
It's been soundproofed.

80
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,266
Kind of like a private studio
for Full Moon?

81
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,466
Just like a professional artist.

82
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:46,566
She is professional, after all.

83
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,366
I still have a long way to go.

84
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:51,766
Ms. Oshige, thank you
for doing all this for me!

85
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,566
Don't mention it.

86
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,433
Living in an apartment with
a view of the ocean was my dream.

87
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,733
Huh? So she did it for
herself, after all.

88
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:11,400
Yeah, I guessed she did.

89
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:19,633
So this is why she went to the trouble
of asking us to come over too.

90
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,600
Who the heck does she
think Death Spirits are?

91
00:06:25,366 --> 00:06:26,000
Oh no!

92
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:28,133
Huh?

93
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:29,733
Excuse me.

94
00:06:30,366 --> 00:06:31,533
You dropped something.

95
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:40,933
Huh?!

96
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,166
What's that?

97
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:45,166
I'm so sorry.

98
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,366
No problem.
I'll put it in the cart.

99
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:49,833
That's Mitsuki.

100
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,133
I wonder what she's doing
in a place like this.

101
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,866
In any case, I must report
this to Mrs. Koyama.

102
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,633
Huh?

103
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:56,466
Oh yeah...

104
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,000
I've summoned
one more person,

105
00:06:58,033 --> 00:06:59,800
besides you guys,
as reinforcement.

106
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,200
Huh? Who is it?

107
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:02,800
Oh, here he comes.

108
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,200
Oh!

109
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:07,100
Dr. Wakaoji!

110
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,566
So you were the
reinforcement, Dr. Wakaoji?

111
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,333
Reinforcement?

112
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:13,166
Thank you for your trouble.

113
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,533
There's a parking lot in the back.

114
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:18,033
U-Umm...

115
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,066
What was the important business
you needed me for?

116
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:21,933
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,766
There were too few men.

118
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:25,766
Huh? Oh...

119
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,300
That woman sure has
a lot of nerve.

120
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,466
You've got to be that tough
if you're gonna be a manager.

121
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,700
B-But is it really okay for me
to help a woman move?

122
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:40,833
<i>- W-Why is Dr. Wakaoji in a place like this?</i>
- Don't worry about that kind of thing.

123
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:43,366
I mean, we do have
a relationship, right?

124
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:45,633
"We do have a relationship"?!

125
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:49,333
I don't really know whether
I'll be of any use to you.

126
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:52,933
Yippee, Dr. Wakaoji will
help us too!

127
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:55,466
Well then, I'll go park my car.

128
00:07:56,566 --> 00:07:57,433
That woman!

129
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,366
What the heck is her relationship
with Dr. Wakaoji?

130
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:11,100
Umm... Would you like me to do that?

131
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,800
I'm...I'm all right!

132
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:15,766
See?

133
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,700
Umm...

134
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:26,700
Mr. Death Spirit...
I'd like to move this over there.

135
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,633
Th-Thank you.

136
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:39,233
She's so mushy with
my Dr. Wakaoji.

137
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:42,200
I will get to the bottom of
who that woman is!

138
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,333
Wow...

139
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:46,266
Looks like we've somehow
managed to get everything in order.

140
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,900
Yes, you saved the day.

141
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,900
Thank you very, very much.

142
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,500
Don't mention it.
I'm glad I was able to help.

143
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,433
Why are they so friendly
with each other?

144
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,500
As I thought, those two must be...

145
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,433
Ms. Tanaka?!

146
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,133
Huh?!

147
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,333
W-Why are you in
a place like this?!

148
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:02,533
Oh...umm... That's because...

149
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,866
What is it, Mitsuki?

150
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:05,600
Who's this person?

151
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:06,966
Ms. Tanaka...

152
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,066
Who's Tanaka?

153
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:10,900
She's the housekeeper
at Mitsuki's house.

154
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:11,800
This ain't good!

155
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:12,833
It ain't good?

156
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:14,100
That goes without saying.

157
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:17,200
If her relationship with
Manager comes to light...

158
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:17,866
I see.

159
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,200
Ms. Tanaka...

160
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,633
Uh...this is...ummm...

161
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,133
Dr. Wakaoji!

162
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:24,333
Y-Yes?!

163
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:25,933
Dr. Wakaoji!

164
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,566
You had a fiancée?!

165
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:29,100
By fiancée, you mean...

166
00:09:31,033 --> 00:09:32,300
You're talking about me?

167
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:38,333
I idolized Dr. Wakaoji!

168
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,766
He was my dream!

169
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,966
He was my hope!

170
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,866
U-Umm... Ms. Tanaka?

171
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:45,433
Please calm down.

172
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:48,400
I do not have that kind
of relationship with Ms. Oshige.

173
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:51,166
I don't understand
what's going on?

174
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,033
I see. All right.

175
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,333
In exchange...

176
00:09:57,766 --> 00:09:59,066
Let's battle it out!

177
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:00,600
Huh?!

178
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,066
The person who is best suited
as Dr. Wakaoji's bride

179
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:08,766
is someone who can cook,
do laundry and clean perfectly!

180
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,133
Let's battle it out to see

181
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,900
which of us is more suited
to fill that role!

182
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:16,866
Dr. Wakaoji...

183
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,100
Do I have to participate
in this battle?

184
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,633
If doing so will calm
Ms. Tanaka down.

185
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,200
All right!

186
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:28,566
I'm getting very excited!

187
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,133
We're getting into
a sticky situation again.

188
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:32,300
All right!

189
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,133
Let's battle it out clean and fair!

190
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,033
Okay! Do whatever you want!

191
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,633
<i>What am I gonna do?</i>

192
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,633
<i>This has turned into
a big mess.</i>

193
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,833
Ms. Tanaka... Ms. Tanaka?

194
00:11:01,466 --> 00:11:02,400
That's strange.

195
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,433
Hasn't she come back
from shopping yet?

196
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,033
One condition a good bride
must meet

197
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,533
is the ability to make
good miso soup!

198
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,433
Go, Mitsuki!

199
00:11:21,466 --> 00:11:22,733
Huh? Oh...

200
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,600
Cooking miso soup battle...
Begin!

201
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:27,933
Yeah!

202
00:11:27,966 --> 00:11:28,800
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

203
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,333
More...here! There!

204
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,566
And miso!

205
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,633
Well? There! More!

206
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,800
It's ready!

207
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:05,700
Here you go.

208
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:06,900
Wow...

209
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,566
- I'm digging in!
- I'm digging in!

210
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,600
Delicious...

211
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:17,166
It's wonderful.

212
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,933
What?!

213
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,066
What's the matter,
you two?!

214
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,633
Well, I mean, she lives alone.

215
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,866
So cooking's not her forte.

216
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,733
Next, a cleaning battle!

217
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,933
On your mark... Go!

218
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:07,366
I'll do okay on this one.

219
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:08,933
Oh my gosh...

220
00:13:09,766 --> 00:13:10,500
Oh my gosh...

221
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:22,966
All right!

222
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:24,100
Finished!

223
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:29,500
I'm not done yet!

224
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:35,833
All right.

225
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,166
Next is a laundry battle.

226
00:13:38,766 --> 00:13:39,633
On your mark...

227
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,033
Start!

228
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:44,866
Why?!

229
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,766
Why a washbasin in
this day and age?

230
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,400
All right! I'm done!

231
00:14:04,866 --> 00:14:07,000
Ms. Oshige, are you all right?

232
00:14:07,633 --> 00:14:08,700
My arms...

233
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,900
I can't lift them.

234
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,700
How annoying!

235
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:16,600
And...

236
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:18,533
Here goes!

237
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,233
W-What's this sudden breeze.

238
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:25,700
And moreover, it's hot!

239
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,833
M-Meroko!
You're overdoing it!

240
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,533
I'm doing this so that
this side will dry sooner.

241
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:33,433
Power up!

242
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,666
No!

243
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,366
The laundry!

244
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,666
W-What?

245
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:49,666
I don't have a clue about
what's happening!

246
00:14:50,066 --> 00:14:52,200
Did I...overdo it?

247
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,866
As I thought...

248
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:01,100
This kind of thing is over my head.

249
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,633
For one's beloved husband...

250
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,600
One cooks delicious meals.

251
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,166
One irons his shirts.

252
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,800
On weekends they enjoy
going shopping together.

253
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:16,033
The house has a warm atmosphere
and many friends gather there.

254
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:18,433
But...but...

255
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,500
That's impossible!

256
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,200
First of all,

257
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:25,833
I haven't lived my life with
the aim of becoming a bride!

258
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,533
What do I care?!

259
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:28,266
I'll live my life out as
a single woman!

260
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:29,766
Some might call me
an ungrateful child,

261
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,933
and even if I'm called a
lady-in-waiting in the workplace,

262
00:15:31,966 --> 00:15:33,533
I'll save up my salary

263
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:36,400
and collect a juicy amount
of employee pension benefits!

264
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,366
I'll live my life out with
the reputation

265
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,933
in the neighborhood
of being a nasty spinster!

266
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,400
M-Ms. Oshige...calm down.

267
00:15:44,933 --> 00:15:46,666
You're beating around
the bush,

268
00:15:46,766 --> 00:15:49,233
but the long and short of it
is that you're admitting defeat, right?

269
00:15:51,766 --> 00:15:53,966
If it will make you
leave these premises.

270
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:55,233
Hey!

271
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:56,400
Are you really okay with that?

272
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:57,800
Don't you feel mortified?!

273
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,133
Sorry to have bothered you.

274
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,300
But young people these days...

275
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,900
Their parents sure haven't
given them any home training.

276
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,800
It's pitiful!

277
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:09,500
Huh?!

278
00:16:10,266 --> 00:16:11,033
Gimme a break!

279
00:16:11,066 --> 00:16:13,800
Parents have nothing
to do with this!

280
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:15,533
Oh, really?

281
00:16:15,566 --> 00:16:17,433
If your parents had given
you proper home training,

282
00:16:17,466 --> 00:16:20,366
you should have been able to make
a better showing in this competition.

283
00:16:20,433 --> 00:16:22,366
Cooking! Laundry! Cleaning!

284
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,600
And that's not all!

285
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,166
Sewing! Evening drinks!
Park debut!

286
00:16:26,366 --> 00:16:28,600
Can you handle all of those?

287
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,833
Let's start the next battle!

288
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,400
That's right! Go for it!

289
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:35,966
Ms. Oshige...

290
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,233
This is getting interesting.

291
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,966
Well, if you win this time,
I don't mind giving you 4 points.

292
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:43,333
Such confidence.

293
00:16:43,366 --> 00:16:45,566
She thinks there's no way
she'll lose, huh?

294
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,900
But if she wins...

295
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:51,933
Ms. Oshige will then come
from behind to win!

296
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:54,233
I'll win, no matter what!

297
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,133
Okay then, for the last,
let's have a shopping war.

298
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,766
- A shopping war?!
- A shopping war?!

299
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,200
Everything you need for sukiyaki!

300
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:04,600
The one who purchases it all
at the least cost within 30 minutes wins!

301
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,966
Sounds good!
I'll take you on!

302
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,033
And so, the last competition
will be a sukiyaki battle!

303
00:17:11,233 --> 00:17:13,000
Oh... Is there something
I can make a sound with?

304
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,200
Come on, let's go along too!

305
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,766
Umm...

306
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:23,000
Hello.

307
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,066
Welcome.

308
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,533
I'd like some meat for sukiyaki.

309
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:28,966
Some sukiyaki beef, right?
Comin' up!

310
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,166
Umm... Sir...

311
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,100
Could you give me
a little discount?

312
00:17:32,566 --> 00:17:35,000
For a beautiful young lady like you,
I'll take 30% off!

313
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,800
Really?!

314
00:17:36,033 --> 00:17:37,500
Thank you, sir.

315
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,933
Wait a second!

316
00:17:39,966 --> 00:17:40,800
Oww...

317
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,800
You played hooky from
work yesterday

318
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,066
and went to play pachinko,
didn't you?!

319
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,766
W-Why do you know that?!

320
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,000
Don't try to pull
a fast one on me!

321
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,333
Last week, you lied
about having a meeting and

322
00:17:49,366 --> 00:17:51,100
went to buy betting tickets
for the horses, didn't you?

323
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,266
I'll tattle on you to your wife.

324
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,100
Umm...

325
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,233
How about 30% off?

326
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,866
Can't you give me half off?

327
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,400
Th-Thank you always
for your patronage.

328
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:06,366
I'm no match for Ms. Tanaka.

329
00:18:10,633 --> 00:18:11,800
Oh...that's cheap.

330
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,300
Excuse me!

331
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,033
Be right there!

332
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,200
I wonder what she's doing
at the fish market?

333
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:17,200
No idea.

334
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:21,400
Umm... Ms. Oshige?

335
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:24,166
What is it, Mitsuki?

336
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:26,833
You don't put fish in sukiyaki.

337
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:29,266
Huh?! You don't?

338
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,100
Of course you don't.

339
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,366
What's up with them playing
around like that?

340
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,933
Is it possible that she's
never eaten sukiyaki before?

341
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,200
That's unbelievable!

342
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:13,733
Oh, they're going to
the milk shop next.

343
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:14,533
Let's follow them.

344
00:19:24,866 --> 00:19:28,033
It looks like this is another
win for me.

345
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,033
They're coming, they're coming.

346
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,033
Dr. Wakaoji?

347
00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:49,966
<i>Do you think there
are enough eggs?</i>

348
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,766
<i>Wouldn't a carton of ten
have been better?</i>

349
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:58,300
<i>No, eggs are high in cholesterol,
so one per person is plenty.</i>

350
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,900
<i>That's so like a doctor.</i>

351
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:02,533
<i>Not at all.</i>

352
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:10,233
W-What's...that?

353
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,266
They make a nice picture together.

354
00:20:13,266 --> 00:20:15,366
They make such a nice picture
together it makes me jealous.

355
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:20,000
Sorry to be late.

356
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:23,000
Listen, you!

357
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,700
Huh? But I'm within the time limit.

358
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:28,533
It's my loss.

359
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:29,900
Huh?

360
00:20:30,933 --> 00:20:32,200
I acknowledge it.

361
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:35,666
This is your win.

362
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,300
Huh?!

363
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:37,900
What do you mean by that?

364
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,166
You can't cook. You're no good
at laundry either.

365
00:20:40,466 --> 00:20:43,000
You're terrible at cleaning
and shopping too!

366
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,366
Ms. Oshige...

367
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,566
But the two of you
look very good together.

368
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,433
Well, I wish you both happiness!

369
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:01,700
Let's be friends since we're going
to be neighbors from now on.

370
00:21:11,766 --> 00:21:13,966
So what was all this about anyway?

371
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,066
The entire day today...

372
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,933
I think...it's all okay now.

373
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:18,600
Yeah...

374
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,833
So Ms. Oshige has now
become Mitsuki's neighbor.

375
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,733
Ms. Oshige?

376
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:25,800
Huh?

377
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,766
Y-Yes!

378
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,966
Please take good care
of Mitsuki.

379
00:21:30,433 --> 00:21:32,200
S-Sure...

380
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,933
Let's do our best,
okay, Mitsuki?

381
00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:35,700
Yes!

382
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,366
I'm so happy! Mitsuki's second single
is finally slated for release.

383
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:25,500
Yeah. Lots of things have
happened to date,

384
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:27,966
but now it's time to celebrate!

385
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,666
And what song is she going with?

386
00:23:29,733 --> 00:23:32,000
She's doing a cover of
one of her father's songs.

387
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,533
I see. I sure hope it's another hit.

388
00:23:34,566 --> 00:23:35,866
What are you saying?!

389
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,666
As long as I, Meroko, am on the case,
that definitely will not be a problem!

390
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,833
There's no mistake that
it'll be a huge hit!

391
00:23:41,366 --> 00:23:44,733
Next time on Full Moon:
"My Father's Song"

392
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,133
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
