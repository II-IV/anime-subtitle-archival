1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,166
Hey! Are you seriously
never going to sing again?

2
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:12,800
I'll transform you as many
times as you want!

3
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:17,966
She's not transforming!

4
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:19,600
Why?

5
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:21,966
Unless Mitsuki has the desire,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,700
we won't be able to transform her
with our Death Spirit powers.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,100
No way.

8
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:31,733
Mitsuki...

9
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:16,866
IS FULL MOON RETIRING AT LAST?!

10
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:25,033
<i>Full Moon...</i>
<i>What in the world is up with her?</i>

11
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:28,000
Madoka, it's time for rehearsal.

12
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,066
Okay!

13
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,933
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

14
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:33,033
Good morning!

15
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:39,333
Hey, hey, have you heard the news?
Full Moon is finally retiring.

16
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:43,900
Yeah, I heard that the record company
is already searching for a new artist.

17
00:02:43,966 --> 00:02:46,433
Really? Maybe I'll bring
them a demo tape!

18
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,766
What? Now?!

19
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:48,833
Hey!

20
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,966
Do me a favor and stop
spreading random rumors!

21
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,733
There's no way she'd retire!

22
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:57,266
Full Moon isn't the kind of girl
who would give up that easily!

23
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,700
Got it?!

24
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:00,366
Oh... Yes.

25
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:01,800
Madoka...

26
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:05,033
Gimme a break!
Running off their mouths like that!

27
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:07,033
I don't know what
it is with you,

28
00:03:07,066 --> 00:03:10,166
but I suggest you do something about
that strong-headed manner of speaking.

29
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:12,800
I take after you in strong-headedness.

30
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh, Ms. Oshige!

31
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:26,666
Oh, Ms. Imamura.

32
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,800
What are you doing here today?
Full Moon is off, right?

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,766
Yes. I came to pick up the fan letters
that were sent here to the program.

34
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:36,500
Oh, I see.

35
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,166
<i>- If I remember correctly,</i>
- Please give her my best regards too.

36
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,600
<i>that woman is</i>
<i>Full Moon's manager.</i>

37
00:03:39,966 --> 00:03:42,233
Thank you.
Well, see you.

38
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:46,666
Ms. Imamura...

39
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,700
Yes? What is it?

40
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,933
What's my schedule for today?

41
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:52,266
You're free for
the rest of the day.

42
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,366
Great!

43
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,066
Huh?

44
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,800
Nothing. Thank you!

45
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:01,300
<i>If I trail her, I might be</i>
<i>able to find out something.</i>

46
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:04,866
Hey! If you don't hurry,
I'll leave you behind!

47
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:20,400
<i>Yes?</i>

48
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:21,833
It's Oshige.

49
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,300
Kamiyama?

50
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,466
This is Full Moon's house?

51
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,266
I see, so they've
gone to the hospital.

52
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,366
I'm sorry that you went
out of your way to visit.

53
00:04:36,433 --> 00:04:39,500
It's no problem.
I'll come by again another day.

54
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:49,100
She still has the fan letters.

55
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,966
Maybe it wasn't here after all.

56
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,166
Huh?

57
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:15,033
<i>That's that girl from back then.</i>

58
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,433
So this is that girl's house?

59
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,700
Are you tired?

60
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,166
Yes.

61
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,600
Mitsuki, you must eat for
the sake of your health.

62
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:40,633
Okay.

63
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,733
Do you think you can
eat something today?

64
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:51,600
I'll bring you some fruit later.

65
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:06,733
Ms. Tanaka.

66
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:07,433
Yes?

67
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,700
Please bring Mitsuki
some fruit later.

68
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:11,933
Yes.

69
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,933
Umm... Ma'am?

70
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:17,633
What is it?

71
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,866
How was the hospital?

72
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:24,766
M-Ma'am?

73
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:38,933
Did you find it?

74
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Who are those guys?

75
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,066
Hey!

76
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,900
Oh, Takuto! Where were you,
slacking off like that?

77
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,133
More importantly, look at that.

78
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,233
Hey, hey.

79
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:09,533
Madoka Wakamatsu? Why?!

80
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
Hey, you!

81
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:19,966
Madoka?

82
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:22,433
Can I come in?
I can, right?

83
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:28,800
Sorry!

84
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:35,333
I was so surprised to see you here!
I couldn't help but say hello!

85
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:41,400
Are you not feeling well?
Do you have a fever?

86
00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:45,766
Oh, you don't have a fever!

87
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:51,733
Am I bothering you?
Do you want me to leave?

88
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:53,766
No.

89
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,500
I didn't think so! After all,
you're a fan of mine, right?

90
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:01,333
You must be thrilled because I came
to visit you when you're sick, right?

91
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:12,466
<i>Dear Grandma, I met with</i>
<i>Dr. Herberd the other day.</i>

92
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,400
<i>I was very happy to hear that</i>
<i>I might recover from my illness.</i>

93
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:19,766
<i>The landscape here in America</i>
<i>is very expansive</i>

94
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,500
<i>and it makes me</i>
<i>feel very small.</i>

95
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,933
<i>Next time, I'd like to come</i>
<i>here with you, Grandma.</i>

96
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:27,266
<i>Mitsuki.</i>

97
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:39,033
That song...
That's my song!

98
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:44,733
Well, I guess Full Moon
sings it too.

99
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,733
Speaking of, Full Moon's manager
dropped by this house.

100
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,900
How do you know her?

101
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,166
You don't feel well, do you?

102
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,466
What happened to all that energy
you had that last time

103
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,466
when you were talking
so big to me?

104
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:05,733
But it's really weird, isn't it?

105
00:09:05,766 --> 00:09:08,133
That Full Moon has suddenly
taken time off from work.

106
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:15,433
You and Full Moon...

107
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,566
I was thinking that I wouldn't
be where I am today

108
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,866
if it hadn't been
for both of you.

109
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,100
You probably wouldn't
understand this,

110
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:25,500
but Full Moon is a girl
who really pisses me off.

111
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:27,766
She seems to be
so full of confidence.

112
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,766
I'm looking forward to
knocking her down someday.

113
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Do you understand
what I mean?

114
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,600
What I'm saying is that if
Full Moon weren't around,

115
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:39,366
I would lose sight of what
I'm aspiring to right now.

116
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,733
So that's how Madoka
sees Full Moon.

117
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:49,500
So it seems. In those days this girl
was so strong it even surprised us.

118
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:54,933
And moreover,
I'd really be depressed

119
00:09:54,966 --> 00:10:00,833
if a cheeky girl like you who told me
that I have my own song lost her vitality.

120
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,166
Madoka...

121
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:08,633
Huh? What? What?

122
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,566
Full Moon...no longer exists.

123
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:14,500
Huh?

124
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:19,800
Come on... Don't talk nonsense!
Hurry up and get well.

125
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:23,233
Is there anything I can do?
Shall I sing you a song?

126
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:27,933
Mitsuki!

127
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:30,833
What's the matter?
Are you all right?

128
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,733
Mitsuki, are you all right?

129
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:38,500
I'm so sorry!
I invited myself in.

130
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:41,366
Hey, hang in there!

131
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,866
Mitsuki, be strong!

132
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:54,433
Ma'am?

133
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,500
U-Umm...

134
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,200
They're asking whether
you have a regular hospital.

135
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
A regular hospital?

136
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,566
<i>Dr. Wakaoji, I cannot entrust her</i>
<i>to you any longer.</i>

137
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,800
<i>From now on, please stay</i>
<i>out of our family's affairs.</i>

138
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:14,433
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>I will switch hospitals as well!</i>

139
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,233
Please take us to
Dr. Wakaoji's hospital!

140
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,833
Mitsuki, you'll be all right now!
You're at the hospital now!

141
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:45,966
Doctor,
we're ready for her now.

142
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,266
All right.

143
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:49,566
Mitsuki...

144
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:58,600
<i>I am not in that girl's heart.</i>
<i>Isn't there anything I can do?</i>

145
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:03,733
We must have Mitsuki
live out her life span!

146
00:12:04,633 --> 00:12:10,400
But it would be cruel to force her
to continue living in this state.

147
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,733
This is the first time I've had to
deal with...such an exhausting case.

148
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:19,300
That's not true!

149
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:22,000
Even if her life is short,

150
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:27,700
making her feel that it was worth living
is part of our job too, right?!

151
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,966
That hurts, Takuto!

152
00:12:35,266 --> 00:12:36,466
Don't say such
irresponsible things!

153
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:38,433
That's impossible.

154
00:12:39,566 --> 00:12:43,400
We're Death Spirits! There's no way
we would be able to do that!

155
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,566
Takuto, you idiot!

156
00:12:53,366 --> 00:12:56,566
Ma'am, I will go get
her clothes and things.

157
00:12:56,866 --> 00:12:57,533
All right.

158
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:01,733
Oh?

159
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:03,633
Umm... How is she?

160
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,733
It seems her condition
has stabilized.

161
00:13:05,766 --> 00:13:06,766
What a relief.

162
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,766
Well, I better go now.

163
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:12,733
You there.

164
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:17,066
I'm sorry about inviting myself in
to see your granddaughter.

165
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,566
I had no idea that
she was that ill.

166
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,433
Are you a friend of
Mitsuki's from before?

167
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,866
Mitsuki?
I didn't know her name was Mitsuki.

168
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,333
I see. Is that what happened?

169
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:40,366
Yes. Thanks to Mitsuki,
I was inspired to persevere.

170
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,600
Until then I thought
I would quit singing, but...

171
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:51,766
<i>I think...that everyone</i>
<i>has a unique song.</i>

172
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,766
<i>There's a song for Full Moon.</i>

173
00:13:56,466 --> 00:14:01,266
<i>But I think that there's also</i>
<i>a song that only you can sing.</i>

174
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,533
<i>I want to hear your song.</i>

175
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:11,533
It made me think that if there is
somebody out there who says

176
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:13,900
they want to hear my song,
I should sing.

177
00:14:14,566 --> 00:14:17,166
It made me think that I should try
and persevere just a little longer.

178
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:22,733
<i>Mitsuki's passion for song...</i>
<i>is what gave this girl strength.</i>

179
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,466
<i>Grandma...</i>

180
00:14:24,633 --> 00:14:30,733
<i>Please listen to</i>
<i>my songs someday!</i>

181
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:40,200
<i>I've never properly listened</i>
<i>to Mitsuki's singing.</i>

182
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,500
Dr. Wakaoji.

183
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:48,633
Mrs. Koyama...

184
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:54,733
Mitsuki... I beg you,
please help Mitsuki.

185
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,433
I will, with my body and soul.

186
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,966
I will do everything within
my power to help her.

187
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:05,933
Please, grant my request!

188
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,966
If you are going to that extent
to ask me, Wakaoji,

189
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,733
it will be risky for the hospital.

190
00:15:10,766 --> 00:15:11,866
But let me try
to do something.

191
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:13,600
Thank you very much.

192
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,500
However,
there is one problem.

193
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,366
Our job is to cure people's
illnesses and save lives.

194
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,500
But unless the patient has
the desire to live or to get better

195
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:30,533
no matter how much effort we put into it
or how expensive our facilities are,

196
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:32,133
we will not be able to
cure their illness.

197
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:33,433
Yes.

198
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,700
I will exert every possible effort
to give Mitsuki hope.

199
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,766
<i>I do understand what</i>
<i>Meroko is saying.</i>

200
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,633
<i>There's no meaning in giving her</i>
<i>hope to live at this point,</i>

201
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,633
<i>when the span of her life</i>
<i>is almost up.</i>

202
00:15:55,966 --> 00:15:58,400
<i>But still, continuing this way</i>
<i>won't do either!</i>

203
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,066
<i>This is...</i>

204
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:05,333
<i>But...that girl's smiles</i>
<i>were all for Eichi.</i>

205
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,300
<i>She was overflowing with</i>
<i>the desire to see Eichi.</i>

206
00:16:13,433 --> 00:16:16,833
That idiot! He should have stayed alive
until he and Mitsuki reunited!

207
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:28,200
All those smiles were for you, Eichi.
So you... You can't die!

208
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,600
Damn it!

209
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,933
Jeez... Why in the world did I
become a Death Spirit!

210
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,200
Th-There it is again!

211
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:52,633
What was that just now?
What happened to me?

212
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,200
What lovely flowers.

213
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,533
I'm so sorry.
She just fell asleep.

214
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,800
Don't worry about it.
I just dropped by to see how she was.

215
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,033
I'm so relieved to see that
her condition has stabilized.

216
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,633
Get better soon, okay?

217
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,433
Well, I'll drop by again.

218
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:19,833
If you're leaving,
let me show you to the door.

219
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,466
Don't worry about it!

220
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:23,400
That's the least I can do.

221
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:32,766
The two that you
were concerned about...

222
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,500
It looks like they're
doing all right now.

223
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:42,366
But...where did your heart go?
Did it freeze up in that snow?

224
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,066
Don't my words reach you?

225
00:17:50,966 --> 00:17:54,966
Mitsuki... Wake up!
Please wake up and sing!

226
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,766
Let's sing together again
one more time, okay?

227
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,333
Okay, Mitsuki?!

228
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:31,233
W-Was that just now...
a memory of when I was alive?

229
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,633
<i>You understand what will</i>
<i>happen to you if you recover</i>

230
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,233
<i>your memory in this state,</i>
<i>don't you?</i>

231
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,633
<i>You will become a ghost</i>
<i>who wanders all alone.</i>

232
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:44,066
Why am I remembering this
all of a sudden?

233
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:47,133
I didn't want to die!

234
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,233
I really didn't want to die!

235
00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:54,200
Why is it?
Why am I feeling these things?

236
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:59,000
Why am I crying?
Why am I so sad?

237
00:18:59,933 --> 00:19:02,933
What exactly did I do
when I was alive?!

238
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:07,800
Takuto?

239
00:19:13,266 --> 00:19:14,700
What's the matter, Takuto?

240
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:16,133
Shut up!

241
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:18,700
Please leave me alone!

242
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:21,833
Takuto!

243
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,000
What is...Takuto thinking?

244
00:19:37,766 --> 00:19:41,033
I don't understand
what he's thinking.

245
00:19:46,766 --> 00:19:48,300
<i>That's a lie.</i>
<i>I do understand.</i>

246
00:19:49,266 --> 00:19:55,000
<i>Even I know that</i>
<i>Takuto loves Mitsuki.</i>

247
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,066
<i>It's so painful.</i>

248
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:09,000
<i>What don't you like about me?</i>
<i>Somebody tell me. Please!</i>

249
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:44,133
You're late, Mero.
I thought you would come sooner.

250
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,833
I don't know
what's what anymore.

251
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,933
Izumi, will you hear me out?

252
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,200
Of course, Mero.

253
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:06,233
I never thought it would be so
painful to keep that girl alive

254
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:07,900
for the duration
of her life span.

255
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:15,266
But Takuto doesn't understand
how I feel at all.

256
00:21:17,933 --> 00:21:22,500
And...why are you hesitating?
That's not like you, Mero.

257
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:25,933
What do you mean?

258
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,833
Well, it's our job to adhere
to the schedule.

259
00:21:30,533 --> 00:21:37,266
But if it's for you, Mero,
I wouldn't mind reaping that girl's life.

260
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:22,333
Meroko! What in the world
were you thinking?

261
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:24,500
I can't believe you
would ask Izumi!

262
00:23:24,933 --> 00:23:29,733
Then what should I have done?!
I don't know what to do anymore.

263
00:23:30,533 --> 00:23:31,200
Meroko...

264
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,700
At this rate,
everyone is going to be unhappy.

265
00:23:33,966 --> 00:23:37,966
I can't stand by and watch anymore!
I hate it! It's all so painful!

266
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:43,266
Next time on Full Moon:
"Izumi's Temptation."

267
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:44,733
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
