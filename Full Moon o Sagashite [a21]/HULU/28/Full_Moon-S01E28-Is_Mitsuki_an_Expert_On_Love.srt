1
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:07,700
One day, as the recording
of the new single approached,

2
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:10,166
Mitsuki was called out by
Dr. Wakaoji.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,533
But this was a trap set by
a tabloid magazine.

4
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:15,700
It was devised to photograph
a scandal involving Full Moon.

5
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:17,666
Gosh! It was an important time
before the recording!

6
00:00:17,966 --> 00:00:20,066
But with words of encouragement
from Dr. Wakaoji,

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,633
Mitsuki's fears disappeared and

8
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:24,666
she resonated with an incredible
singing voice at the recording!

9
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:27,833
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,700
Got that?

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:34,733
Yes.

12
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:25,566
Excuse me...

13
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:27,366
Huh?! One right now?

14
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:35,233
Excuse me, are you going to
tell me to pose or anything?

15
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,166
You can do whatever you want,

16
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,100
if you want to move,
you can move.

17
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:41,300
If you're tired, you can rest!

18
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:54,933
Hey, is this okay?

19
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:58,166
It's going to be used
for the CD jacket.

20
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:00,833
The camera's a disposable one too.

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,400
That's probably her vision.

22
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,066
Huh?

23
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,333
Don't you think Mitsuki's natural
charm comes out more this way?

24
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:08,866
Do you think so?

25
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,100
I don't know.

26
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,133
Nice scent.

27
00:03:14,566 --> 00:03:16,033
Hey, do you know?

28
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:18,633
The language of flowers for cosmos.

29
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:19,533
No.

30
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,900
"Young girl's sincerity."
It's perfect for you.

31
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:40,933
Hey, Takuto.

32
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:41,900
What?

33
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,200
Do you want to go to the
amusement park or something?

34
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:44,966
Why?

35
00:03:45,366 --> 00:03:49,200
Mitsuki's photo shoot for
the second CD's jacket is over,

36
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:51,700
so that means we did good work.

37
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,533
Then why don't you invite her?

38
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,700
Gosh, you don't understand
a girl's heart at all.

39
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:00,766
A girl's heart?

40
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:07,533
Indeed, things that change are
a girl's heart and the autumn sky.

41
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,900
What? Is that a haiku?

42
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:13,633
– We're here.
– Hello!

43
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,566
Hey, I was waiting for all of you.

44
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,800
Come on up, come on up.

45
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,800
Say, guess who I saw?!

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What are they doing?

47
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:26,966
It's probably a study session.

48
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,833
Hey, look, look.

49
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:31,033
This is so cute.

50
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:32,100
You're right.

51
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:36,666
Nice sound.

52
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:38,066
Yeah, really.

53
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:40,800
Both of you! Work over here too.

54
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,266
– Okay.
– Okay.

55
00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:45,466
Hey Kumi, if I remember,
you do this one like this?

56
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,533
Yeah, yeah.

57
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:49,300
Huh? Kumi, don't you do it like this?

58
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:50,933
Yeah, yeah.

59
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:53,200
– Well, which one is it?!
– Well, which one is it?!

60
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:54,433
– Kumi!
– Kumi!

61
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:56,633
Oh?! What, what?

62
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:58,100
– Jeez!
– Jeez!

63
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,666
Kumi, you seem to have no energy.

64
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,833
Do you think so?

65
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:06,333
Oww!

66
00:05:06,366 --> 00:05:07,533
Sorry, sorry!

67
00:05:07,866 --> 00:05:09,166
It's the usual, Kumi.

68
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,633
Seems like it.

69
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh, I can't draw well.

70
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:19,566
In that case, it's good to
use some picture as a reference.

71
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,700
– How can I do this?
– Oops, a mistake!

72
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,466
Hey! Look at this!

73
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,833
Huh? What?

74
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:38,800
What? What?

75
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:41,733
Ta-da! Who is this?

76
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:44,633
Oh, who is this boy?
So cute.

77
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:47,533
Hey, the girl next to him is Mitsuki.

78
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:48,800
You're right!

79
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:51,000
– Then, this is...
– Then, this is...

80
00:05:52,566 --> 00:05:55,700
– Who is this boy?
– Who is this boy?

81
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:58,300
Oh! Well, that is...that is...

82
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:02,233
– Mitsuki!
– Mitsuki!

83
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:04,833
Why did it happen like this?

84
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:10,633
Therefore, Eichi departed for America.

85
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,133
Wonderful!

86
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,633
So that's what happened.

87
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,033
It's a story you can cry about,

88
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:17,933
no matter how many times
you listen to it.

89
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:20,233
What's wrong, Takuto?

90
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,800
Is this something that you'd
normally talk about so frankly?!

91
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:24,533
Huh?

92
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,966
I mean it's not a thing to
chatter about with other people.

93
00:06:28,366 --> 00:06:31,166
Those kinds of precious memories
should be stored

94
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,066
quietly inside your heart!

95
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,266
Don't you think so?

96
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,800
M-Maybe...

97
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,033
Man! I don't understand
a girl's heart!

98
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,200
That's incredible!

99
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,866
How romantic!

100
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:47,566
It's such a surprise that a girl
like that is in our class.

101
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,166
Oh, my dream,
reach beyond the Pacific Ocean.

102
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:53,833
Reach beyond!

103
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,366
Wait!

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,333
Surely, the ending will be Eichi
mounted on a white horse,

105
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:03,766
arriving to pick up Mitsuki!

106
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,733
Now Mitsuki, take my hand.

107
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:08,566
Yes...Eichi...

108
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,866
I wish I could love like that!

109
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:22,600
Now, now!

110
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:26,200
Starting today, for one week,
we will start a mini-corner with Full Moon,

111
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:30,700
who has set the release for
her second CD, "Eternal Snow."

112
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,466
Now, please take it away, Full Moon.

113
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,133
Yes, it's "Full Moon's
Eternal Correspondence!"

114
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:38,566
That's a title, left as it is.

115
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:39,566
Yeah...

116
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:45,966
Now, to the next fax-mail.
It's from radio name, "Girl Sanshiro."

117
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,366
"Hello, Miss Full Moon."

118
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,233
"I have been a big fan of
you since your debut."

119
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:52,633
Thank you very much.

120
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,966
"To tell you the truth,
I have somebody I like right now."

121
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,933
Wow.

122
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,466
"I was not aware of it until now."

123
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,000
"But recently, I saw his cool appearance
and fell in love with him."

124
00:08:05,566 --> 00:08:10,100
"And I want to confess to him,
but please tell me what I should do."

125
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,900
Well, you know,
in this kind of circumstance...

126
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:20,533
If you believe...
your feelings will reach...him...

127
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:21,566
I think...

128
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:24,366
I'm sorry, I wasn't able
to answer very well,

129
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,833
but please try your best.

130
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:30,000
Now, I will give my song
as a present to Miss Girl Sanshiro.

131
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:32,733
This is Full Moon's "Eternal Snow."

132
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,500
Good morning, Kumi.

133
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,566
Oh... G-Good morning!

134
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,300
What's wrong, Kumi?

135
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,100
You've been acting weird
since last time.

136
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,366
Hey! Hey wait, Kumi!
We have school, school!

137
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,133
Please Mitsuki,
come with me a little bit!

138
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:08,633
Hey Mitsuki, what do you think

139
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,833
"if you believe, your feeling
will reach him" means?

140
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,533
What?

141
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:18,900
W-Well, Full Moon was saying something
like that on the radio yesterday.

142
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:25,266
Do you think it means waiting
until the other person realizes?

143
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,266
Or is there an even deeper meaning?

144
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:32,033
I don't think it has
such a deep meaning!

145
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:32,866
Huh?

146
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,433
Well, you know, I was also
listening to the radio show.

147
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:38,266
And that answer by Full Moon

148
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,566
felt like she didn't know
that much about romance.

149
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,666
Do you think so?

150
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:46,166
Yeah. If she were knowledgeable,

151
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,466
she would have given
better advice, yup!

152
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:50,900
Really?

153
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,233
Mitsuki, you understand because
you're an expert on romance.

154
00:09:54,266 --> 00:09:54,966
What?!

155
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,300
Hey Mitsuki!
I want you to be my advisor,

156
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,066
as the master of romance!

157
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,033
H-Hey Kumi, you're misunderstanding
something.

158
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,100
I'm not an expert on romance.

159
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:12,566
Actually, I was the one
who faxed Full Moon yesterday.

160
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:15,666
What?! Then you're Girl Sanshiro?

161
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:20,200
Yeah. I've been doing judo
since I was little.

162
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,566
Please! Please give me advice,
I don't have anybody else!

163
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,233
Well, you know... If there's
something that I can do...

164
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,866
Oh my...

165
00:10:37,066 --> 00:10:38,266
I don't know what's gonna happen.

166
00:10:38,766 --> 00:10:40,366
And, who is the other person?

167
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,966
Machida...

168
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,500
So it was Machida.

169
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,166
Until recently...

170
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,500
<i>There!</i>

171
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,566
<i>Ouch!</i>

172
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,066
<i>You dummy!</i>

173
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,633
<i>Shut up, you!</i>

174
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,133
It was like that, but...

175
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,233
<i>Kumi, are you really going</i>
<i>to jump over that?</i>

176
00:11:25,266 --> 00:11:28,700
<i>Don't worry, don't worry.</i>
<i>Just watch and see.</i>

177
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,466
<i>She flew over.</i>

178
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:39,466
<i>That's incredible, Kumi.</i>

179
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:40,733
<i>Yeah!</i>

180
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:45,600
<i>– Kumi!</i>
<i>– Oh!</i>

181
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,666
<i>What do you mean,</i>
<i>"don't worry," dummy?</i>

182
00:11:57,533 --> 00:12:00,300
After that, I was suddenly
conscious of Machida

183
00:12:02,866 --> 00:12:05,333
and I couldn't be around him
the same way anymore.

184
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:06,933
Kumi...

185
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:10,233
Yup, yup, I understand.

186
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:15,866
Hey Mitsuki, what should I do first?
Teach me! Please!

187
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:18,133
What? Th-That's...

188
00:12:18,366 --> 00:12:19,066
Mitsuki!

189
00:12:23,966 --> 00:12:28,433
Oh yeah! Let's first
do research on Machida!

190
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,966
How are we
going to do research?

191
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,366
Don't worry, leave it to me!

192
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,966
<i>And thus, it will now become</i>
<i>the most suitable season</i>

193
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,900
<i>for studying and sports.</i>

194
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,900
<i>Everybody, please engage in</i>
<i>your interests with your best efforts.</i>

195
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,433
Hey, you!

196
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:00,733
W-What?!

197
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:03,300
W-What is it?

198
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,733
I'm doing a program called
"The Rumored Handsome Boy in Town."

199
00:13:06,766 --> 00:13:08,333
Can I interview you?

200
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:10,066
R-Right now?

201
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,866
Here we go. Let's do this
interview at once.

202
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:17,200
To be frank...
Do you have a girlfriend?

203
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:18,666
I don't have one.

204
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:20,766
What is your preferred type?

205
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,166
Nothing in particular.

206
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,733
What is your favorite food?

207
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:25,066
Umm...

208
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,766
It's hamburger. Can I go now?

209
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:29,833
My homeroom is about to begin.

210
00:13:29,866 --> 00:13:33,133
Yeah, thanks.
See you later, Machida.

211
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:36,500
No problem... Wait!
How did you know my name?

212
00:13:37,966 --> 00:13:39,600
Sh-She's gone?

213
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,433
Machida doesn't seem to
have a girlfriend.

214
00:13:43,466 --> 00:13:45,900
He doesn't have
a particular type of girl he likes,

215
00:13:46,066 --> 00:13:47,800
and his favorite food is hamburger.

216
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:50,433
You really are the master of romance.

217
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:52,100
How did you do the research?

218
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:53,766
Oh, that's a secret.

219
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,400
And what's next?

220
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:56,366
Next?

221
00:13:56,766 --> 00:13:58,033
What should I do?

222
00:13:58,566 --> 00:13:59,533
A present.

223
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,066
Make a hamburger-shaped cookie
with a love letter as a present.

224
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:09,566
How about making a hamburger-shaped
cookie with a love letter as a present?

225
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:13,500
Love letter?
I've never written one.

226
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,400
Leave it to me!

227
00:14:15,566 --> 00:14:17,300
I'm not involved in this, okay?

228
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:24,400
Here comes Machida.

229
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:25,900
Y-Yeah.

230
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,033
Umm... Next is Literature class.

231
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:32,266
He noticed!

232
00:14:32,433 --> 00:14:33,533
Y-Yeah.

233
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,933
He noticed the love letter!

234
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,866
Yeah...

235
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:40,800
He's reading it, he's reading it!

236
00:14:52,633 --> 00:14:54,233
What? What happened?

237
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:55,566
I don't know.

238
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,266
Maybe he thinks that
it's somebody's practical joke.

239
00:14:58,433 --> 00:14:59,033
What?!

240
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,900
What's wrong, Kumi?

241
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:08,566
But I'm embarrassed!

242
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,366
Don't say a thing like that.
Come on!

243
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,833
I wonder if Machida will come.

244
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:32,866
It's fine, I'm sure it'll go well.

245
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:34,700
Okay then, I'll leave now.

246
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:35,433
What?!

247
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:38,533
Wait, aren't you going
to stay with me?

248
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:40,666
Isn't it a problem if I stay with you?

249
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,233
It's not a problem.

250
00:15:42,266 --> 00:15:44,733
Well, maybe it is a problem.

251
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,333
But I'm just uneasy being alone!

252
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,200
Please!

253
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:50,700
O-Okay.

254
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:59,500
<i>Mr. Machida, although</i>
<i>from the shadows,</i>

255
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:01,333
<i>there's something I would like</i>
<i>to say to you.</i>

256
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:06,200
<i>Therefore, please come to</i>
<i>the back of the gymnasium today.</i>

257
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:09,566
<i>From a young girl who thinks of you.</i>

258
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,333
It's possible. This weird sentence
would be possible for Koyama.

259
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,766
But if I'm wrong...

260
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,700
<i>Caught you, caught you!</i>

261
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,800
I'm going to be a laughing stock.

262
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:40,566
I'm going home!

263
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:41,700
Hey, hey!

264
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,733
Why? Let's wait a little bit longer.

265
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:45,833
But...

266
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,100
Little bit longer! Okay, Kumi?

267
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:50,500
Yeah...

268
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,700
Please Takuto!
Bring Machida over.

269
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:03,566
I know, even I...
But Kumi is serious!

270
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,366
I can't pretend to ignore her!

271
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:09,133
I was to support Kumi
so her love would come true!

272
00:17:10,466 --> 00:17:11,933
All right, all right.

273
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:15,566
I won't say this and that anymore,
do your best in your own way.

274
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,233
Thank you!
Then, you'll bring Machida over?

275
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,700
Meroko already went to bring him here.

276
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:28,866
Wait! Please wait!

277
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:30,300
Dang it.

278
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,033
Why does it fly away when
there's not even a wind?!

279
00:17:33,066 --> 00:17:35,600
That's because I caught it.

280
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:39,866
Wait!

281
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:48,233
Oh?

282
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,633
M-Machida!

283
00:17:58,066 --> 00:18:00,566
Y-You were waiting for me until now.

284
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,066
You think that much of me?

285
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,066
Show your courage...now!

286
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,300
U-U-Umm...Machida...actually...you know...

287
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,500
Sorry, Koyama.
I...didn't realize...

288
00:18:24,866 --> 00:18:25,666
Huh?

289
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:26,900
I get it.

290
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:28,466
You didn't have the
courage to say it alone,

291
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,633
so you had Saginomiya...

292
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,200
What?! U-Umm...

293
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:33,833
But it's wrong to have a girl say it.

294
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:35,733
As a man, I have to say it himself!

295
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,066
Koyama!

296
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,166
Y-Yes.

297
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,733
If you don't mind,
please go out with me!

298
00:18:39,966 --> 00:18:41,333
First as friends.

299
00:18:43,466 --> 00:18:45,200
W-What is happening?

300
00:18:45,233 --> 00:18:47,133
I told you something like
this was gonna happen!

301
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:50,066
U-Umm... That's not it, Machida!
It's...

302
00:18:57,233 --> 00:18:59,466
K-Kumi! Wait!

303
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,233
Kumi!

304
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,100
W-What in the world is happening?

305
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,400
Don't you understand?

306
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,266
You made a mistake in
the person you confessed to! Jeez!

307
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:30,866
Kumi...

308
00:19:38,966 --> 00:19:41,300
Machida misunderstood.

309
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:44,100
Let's go back and clearly
explain to him, okay?

310
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:50,700
I can't. I'm not even
on Machida's mind.

311
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:52,600
That's not true.

312
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,466
It's true! It's so true!

313
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,833
It's because I'm not feminine at all!

314
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,700
I'm rough and my hobby
is judo of all things.

315
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,033
The type of girl that Machida likes
is probably somebody like you!

316
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,766
Sorry. I'm not actually mad at you.

317
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:14,266
Oh no, it's fine.
But you'll definitely regret it.

318
00:20:14,766 --> 00:20:17,033
Because it happened to me.

319
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:22,133
When Eichi left for America
I couldn't say it.

320
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,433
"I like you."

321
00:20:24,733 --> 00:20:30,833
I'm really regretting
why I couldn't say that one thing.

322
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:35,366
You didn't tell him
that you like him?

323
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:37,700
Didn't I tell you last time?

324
00:20:37,966 --> 00:20:41,100
Oh? Sorry, I wasn't listening carefully.

325
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,800
But, do you now understand?

326
00:20:44,233 --> 00:20:47,400
I'm...not an expert on romance.

327
00:20:49,466 --> 00:20:52,400
You're right.
You don't want to regret it.

328
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:56,200
Instead of thinking later that
I should have done this at that time...

329
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,466
Maybe it's better to have my say.

330
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,933
Let's go back.
Let's go back and say it clearly.

331
00:21:03,966 --> 00:21:05,100
That you like him.

332
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:12,166
Okay, it's another fax-mail from
radio name, "Girl Sanshiro,"

333
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,433
who sent us one earlier.

334
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:16,666
"Hello Miss Full Moon."

335
00:21:16,966 --> 00:21:20,733
"I finally confessed to the boy
that I told you about last time."

336
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,566
That's great.

337
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:24,833
"There were all kinds of
misunderstandings,"

338
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:28,800
"but we will be going out,
first as friends."

339
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:30,466
"Please give me your support."

340
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,600
Of course!

341
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,500
"P.S. I would like to make
a request to my friend"

342
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:37,300
"who was not able to say 'I like you'"

343
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,700
"to somebody she liked in the past,
but is working hard today."

344
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,700
Okay, here's the request from

345
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,733
Miss Girl Sanshiro.

346
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,900
Here's my "Eternal Snow."

347
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,233
I-Izumi is...

348
00:23:22,566 --> 00:23:27,300
Izumi? Impossible, not that Izumi!
He's appeared in the human world?!

349
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:28,566
That's the one!

350
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,466
Ordered here by the
Division Chief of Death Spirits!

351
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,366
He's checking up on us to see
if we're doing our job right!

352
00:23:34,566 --> 00:23:39,400
Damn! At such a bad time too!
It's Mitsuki's concert for her new song!

353
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,566
Next time on Full Moon:
"The New Death Spirits,
