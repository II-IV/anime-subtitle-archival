1
00:00:05,566 --> 00:00:06,766
Why are my memories...

2
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:09,066
I really didn't want to die!

3
00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:12,866
Why is it?
Why am I feeling these things?

4
00:00:13,566 --> 00:00:15,866
What exactly did I do
when I was alive?!

5
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:19,933
Takuto?

6
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:23,200
What's the matter, Takuto?

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,400
Shut up!

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,300
Please leave me alone!

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,300
Takuto!

10
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:21,966
Izumi, will you hear me out?

11
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,900
I never thought it
would be so painful

12
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:27,500
to keep that girl alive for
the duration of her life span.

13
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:35,633
But Takuto doesn't understand
how I feel at all.

14
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,266
Well, it's our job to
adhere to the schedule,

15
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,933
but do you want me to
fix that problem for you?

16
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:49,266
What do you mean?

17
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:54,966
I would reap that girl's life
in your place.

18
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:55,733
What?

19
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,000
You're awake, Mikki?

20
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,366
Long time no see.

21
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:07,100
What's the matter?
Did you forget my name?

22
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,433
Poor Mikki.
No one can save you now.

23
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:25,233
I'll take you to the world where
your parents and Eichi are.

24
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,400
Eichi...

25
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:30,900
That's right.
Don't you want to see him?

26
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:38,033
Come, follow me.

27
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:08,066
<i>What has happened to me?</i>

28
00:05:09,766 --> 00:05:12,466
<i>That's my memory from</i>
<i>when I was alive.</i>

29
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:15,800
<i>Why, all of a sudden?</i>

30
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:28,533
<i>I just wanted her to sing one more time.</i>
<i>That's all I wanted.</i>

31
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:32,633
<i>Takuto?</i>

32
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:36,266
<i>I like your singing, Takuto.</i>

33
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,266
<i>Hey Takuto,</i>
<i>what kind of songs did you sing?</i>

34
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,900
It's happening again!

35
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,266
Why does this happen
when I think about singing?

36
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,600
Why... Why is this happening?

37
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,000
My...throat?

38
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,000
<i>We'll have to resort to surgery.</i>

39
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,133
<i>No, he won't be able to sing again.</i>

40
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:52,166
<i>I remember... I used to sing.</i>

41
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:55,933
<i>But a tumor formed in my lungs.</i>

42
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,833
<i>And I sped off on my motorcycle</i>
<i>out of despair. And I died.</i>

43
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,733
Damn it!

44
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,533
I can't believe I died.

45
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:14,700
I... I...

46
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,300
That was great, wasn't it?

47
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,333
Yeah.

48
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:27,966
They sure know how to perform.

49
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,233
We've gotta work hard to catch up!

50
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:42,400
I used to sing.

51
00:07:43,866 --> 00:07:44,533
By myself?

52
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,166
Or in a group?

53
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:56,333
<i>Takuto!</i>

54
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:10,100
<i>Takuto.</i>

55
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,200
Wakaoji...

56
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,333
No way!

57
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,666
<i>The world where Eichi</i>
<i>and my parents are.</i>

58
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:36,933
<i>Where is that?</i>

59
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,933
Tonight is the new moon,

60
00:08:44,966 --> 00:08:47,166
but the moon is there even though
you might not be able to see it.

61
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:50,000
Didn't Eichi teach you that?

62
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,300
And that Eichi, your mom,
and your dad...

63
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,633
All the people that you want
to see are in the moon.

64
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
In the moon?

65
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,866
Not only them.

66
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,133
There are also animals
in the moon too.

67
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:09,566
Like the mochi-making
rabbit and cats too.

68
00:09:12,566 --> 00:09:14,600
There's an African mythology
that goes like this.

69
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,600
Long ago, God tried to bestow
eternal life to humans

70
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:21,566
and sent a rabbit
as a messenger.

71
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,500
But the rabbit opposed the idea, saying,
"Humans are supposed to die."

72
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,200
So God got mad and locked
the rabbit in the moon.

73
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:38,200
Rabbits have always been a little dumb.
I guess that's what makes them cute.

74
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Don't you agree?

75
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,866
Now...

76
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:49,100
That's a good girl.

77
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,400
<i>I depended on Izumi</i>
<i>without thinking.</i>

78
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,866
<i>But right now, Izumi might be</i>
<i>doing what he said he'd do.</i>

79
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,866
<i>Maybe I shouldn't have run away</i>
<i>just because it was so tough.</i>

80
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,400
<i>The one who's suffering</i>
<i>the most is her.</i>

81
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:28,333
<i>Eichi died two years ago.</i>

82
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:29,300
<i>Huh?</i>

83
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,133
<i>My son and daughter-in-law</i>
<i>adopted Eichi,</i>

84
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,466
<i>but all three of them died</i>
<i>in an automobile accident.</i>

85
00:10:38,766 --> 00:10:41,100
<i>He...died?</i>

86
00:10:44,366 --> 00:10:49,666
<i>But I just couldn't watch her</i>
<i>like that anymore.</i>

87
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:58,300
<i>But it would be cruel to force her</i>
<i>to continue living in this state.</i>

88
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,033
<i>This is the first time I've had to deal with...</i>
<i>such an exhausting case.</i>

89
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,400
<i>That's not true!</i>

90
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,200
<i>Even if her life is short,</i>

91
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:14,966
<i>making her feel that it was worth living</i>
<i>is part of our job too, right?!</i>

92
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:18,966
<i>What was I supposed to do?</i>

93
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,233
<i>I'm so lonely without you, Meroko.</i>

94
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:31,300
<i>Without you, Meroko, it's like</i>
<i>there's something missing...</i>

95
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,666
<i>like something's different.</i>

96
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,733
<i>We have to be together.</i>

97
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,266
<i>If the three of us aren't together</i>
<i>like we used to be, it'll be sad.</i>

98
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:41,033
<i>So let's go home together!</i>

99
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:52,433
<i>Here you go.</i>

100
00:11:52,466 --> 00:11:53,766
<i>It's cute!</i>

101
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,766
<i>You and Takuto are</i>
<i>my precious friends.</i>

102
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,400
<i>I love you so much, Meroko!</i>

103
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
Mitsuki...

104
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:18,233
Mitsuki...

105
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,400
Mitsuki!

106
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,900
Mitsuki!

107
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,533
Maybe I'll tell you another story
about the moon.

108
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,500
Do you know why the moon
waxes and wanes?

109
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:25,000
The other gods were jealous
of the moon goddess's beauty.

110
00:13:25,866 --> 00:13:31,733
Fearing that people's hearts would never
turn to them if the moon were always full,

111
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:34,233
they made an agreement.

112
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:41,200
They promised her eternal beauty
if she would go away every so often.

113
00:13:42,466 --> 00:13:45,533
So the moon also
symbolizes eternity.

114
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:49,700
Everybody's existence
is eternal in the moon.

115
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,733
Welcome to the world
of the eternal moon.

116
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,066
<i>Takuto.</i>

117
00:14:18,266 --> 00:14:24,100
<i>Wakaoji... No, Keichi,</i>
<i>I finally remember you.</i>

118
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,433
<i>You, me,</i>
<i>and Mitsuki's father Aoi.</i>

119
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,966
<i>I remember the days when</i>
<i>we used to play together.</i>

120
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,666
<i>Route L... The place</i>
<i>where I started singing...</i>

121
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:40,666
<i>And the place that took me in</i>
<i>when I had no relatives.</i>

122
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:44,800
<i>That feeling that I felt back then...</i>

123
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,966
<i>It was because I was able to see</i>
<i>what was important to me again.</i>

124
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:54,233
<i>I'm regretting the fact</i>
<i>that I died!</i>

125
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:58,066
<i>I should have lived,</i>
<i>more strongly!</i>

126
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:00,200
<i>Mitsuki...</i>

127
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:02,600
<i>I don't care if I become a ghost!</i>

128
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:06,933
<i>I won't allow her to have the same</i>
<i>kind of regrets that I have!</i>

129
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:18,033
Now, come.

130
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:19,500
Mikki!

131
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:36,600
Look down below.

132
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:45,566
Eichi?

133
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,533
And your dad and mom.

134
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,066
My dad and mom...

135
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,900
I told you, the moon is there
even if you don't see it in the sky.

136
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,200
And that's the entrance
to the world of the moon.

137
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,133
<i>Mitsuki, I missed you!</i>

138
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,900
<i>Mitsuki, I have so much to tell you.</i>
<i>Hurry over here.</i>

139
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:18,333
<i>Mitsuki, you've grown so much.</i>
<i>Come and show me your face!</i>

140
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:24,900
Dad, mom, Eichi...
I missed you.

141
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:28,366
I wanted to see you so badly.

142
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:36,100
Dad?

143
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:37,533
Mom?

144
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:40,233
<i>Mitsuki, goodbye.</i>

145
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:41,600
No.

146
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,833
No, Eichi.

147
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,666
Don't leave.

148
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,066
Now, Mikki, let's go together to
the world of the eternal moon.

149
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,700
Mitsuki!

150
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,366
Who?

151
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,300
Getting in the way...

152
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:18,633
Get off of there now!
It's dangerous! Now!

153
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,300
Don't think of killing yourself!

154
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:22,733
<i>Kill myself?</i>

155
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:29,500
<i>But I'm just going to go see</i>
<i>Eichi and my dad and mom.</i>

156
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:35,666
<i>Where?</i>

157
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,233
Please, Mitsuki!

158
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,233
Please just come over here!

159
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:51,600
If I let you die, Hazuki and your father
will never forgive me!

160
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,300
No!
I-I don't want you to die!

161
00:17:58,233 --> 00:18:00,600
I don't want anybody
to die anymore.

162
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,933
Please, just come back!

163
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,100
Mitsuki!

164
00:18:12,766 --> 00:18:14,466
Grandma?

165
00:18:14,933 --> 00:18:18,100
In that case,
I guess I'll have to be a little rough.

166
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,366
That's right. It's Grandma.
So please get over here right away.

167
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Grandma?

168
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,333
Grandma...

169
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,700
Mitsuki, come on!

170
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,333
Grandma!

171
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,033
No!

172
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,333
It's useless. It's too late.

173
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,800
Grandma! Grandma!

174
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:34,266
Grandma!

175
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:36,066
What's too late?

176
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:46,066
Takuto!

177
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:49,533
Grandma!

178
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:52,233
Don't worry.
She just fainted.

179
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,033
Izumi, you little...
I'm not going to forgive you this time!

180
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,900
Don't get so mad.

181
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,366
It's not entirely my fault this time.

182
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:04,666
What?!

183
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,000
He's right. It's my fault.

184
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,000
This all started because
I depended on Izumi.

185
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:14,633
I told you.

186
00:20:15,066 --> 00:20:15,733
But...

187
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,600
I was wrong! Even if we are Death Spirits,
we can't do things like this!

188
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:33,166
Mitsuki, you had to go through such
a scary experience because of me.

189
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,466
I'm sorry!

190
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:46,100
Mitsuki...

191
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,633
Oh boy, now I'm the bad guy.

192
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:59,166
I was just trying to take
her soul for you Meroko.

193
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:04,233
This is why I shouldn't butt
into people's business.

194
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:06,166
Izumi...

195
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,933
More importantly, you remember
all of it now, right, Takuto?

196
00:21:11,766 --> 00:21:16,666
Or should I call you
Takuto Kira of Route L?

197
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,066
Y-You! How did you know that?!

198
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:27,566
I'd love to hear you sing
one of these days

199
00:21:28,766 --> 00:21:30,466
before you become a ghost.

200
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:37,533
<i>Takuto, do you remember</i>
<i>your past now?</i>

201
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,966
<i>Route L?</i>
<i>Dad and Dr. Wakaoji's band?</i>

202
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,933
I remember. When I was a human,
I was in Route L.

203
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:26,500
Takuto, your memories
have returned?

204
00:23:26,866 --> 00:23:29,700
No! You have to forget them right away!
Or else something bad will happen!

205
00:23:29,733 --> 00:23:30,400
It's fine.

206
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:35,200
If the return of my memories
causes her to want sing again,

207
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:37,133
I want to remember everything.

208
00:23:37,466 --> 00:23:40,066
Takuto, no! Takuto!

209
00:23:41,066 --> 00:23:44,566
Next time on Full Moon:
"New Moon Night."

210
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,100
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
