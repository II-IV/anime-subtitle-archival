1
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:09,533
Meet Mitsuki Koyama, 12 years old.
Her dream is to become a singer.

2
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:12,633
But, poor thing,
she only has one year to live.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,266
We're a couple
of Death Spirits and

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,833
we were sent to make sure
her destiny doesn't change.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,666
But somehow we ended up turning her
into a sixteen-year-old

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,600
and we helped her win
a singing audition!

7
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:24,500
Do you think that counts
as changing her destiny?

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,633
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

9
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,066
Got that?

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:34,800
Yes.

11
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:24,066
U-Umm... I'm home.

12
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:32,600
What's with her?
That was really unfriendly!

13
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,933
Okay, tomorrow I'll make a lot of sweets.

14
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:39,800
Which do you like,
bean jam or soy flour?

15
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:40,533
Oh, or...

16
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,566
I'm home.

17
00:02:41,966 --> 00:02:46,300
Umm... Mitsuki just got home.
Here, I'll put her on the phone!

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,866
<i>Hello?</i>

19
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:50,900
You're finally there.

20
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:55,133
I was wondering how long
I'd have to talk to Ms. Tanaka.

21
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,666
Dr. Wakaoji?!

22
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:57,900
What happened?

23
00:02:57,933 --> 00:02:59,566
Why are you calling me?

24
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,200
<i>Actually, it seems they've decided
who will be your manager.</i>

25
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:07,133
What?
Manager?

26
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
You're too loud!

27
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:10,266
She's pricked up her ears.

28
00:03:14,566 --> 00:03:16,666
Why at your place?

29
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,200
<i>Well I'm tentatively
your guardian, aren't I?</i>

30
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,966
<i>I was contacted not long ago.</i>

31
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:29,600
<i>The manager said she's going to come
and meet with you and me.</i>

32
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,400
<i>Mitsuki, can you come to
the hospital now?</i>

33
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes!
I'll be right there!

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
<i>Along Came the Manager</i>

35
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:51,566
Dr. Wakaoji is coming for
a house call tomorrow, isn't he?

36
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:53,000
Yes, that's true.

37
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,733
But he wants me to come
to the hospital right away.

38
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,100
Umm... I have some shopping to do,
so shall I take Mitsuki to the hospital?

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,933
Yes, please do.

40
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,933
Stop it, Meroko!

41
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,600
Not yet!
Mitsuki is still changing!

42
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,433
It's all right now!

43
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:20,833
Well, it doesn't really matter
what you change into.

44
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,733
You can't meet your manager
looking like that, anyway!

45
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:25,133
Oh, that's right!

46
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,766
So, when we get to the hospital,
make me sixteen, Takuto.

47
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,266
What?

48
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:32,733
Wait a minute.

49
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,433
That's okay for the manager.

50
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,400
But as for her guardian,

51
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:39,500
she'll have to meet the manager
with him, won't she?

52
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:40,566
Isn't that right?

53
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,266
What will the doctor think
when he sees her

54
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,300
after her transformation
into a 16-year-old?

55
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:48,200
What are you doing?

56
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,566
What do you mean? Umm...

57
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,800
Times like this call for
the Death Spirit Handbook.

58
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:57,933
<i>Just as I thought.</i>

59
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:00,366
<i>We'll tell them everything!</i>

60
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:04,100
<i>These are the Death Spirits,
Takuto and Meroko!</i>

61
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,033
<i>Takuto transformed my 12-year-old body
into a 16-year-old's body.</i>

62
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,100
<i>And at that time,</i>

63
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:13,133
<i>my throat got healed, and now
I can sing to my heart's content!</i>

64
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,300
<i>Well, well, is that what's going on?!</i>

65
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,500
<i>I have no problem
with that either!</i>

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,533
Yeah!

67
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,300
- Don't say, "Yeah"!
- Don't say, "Yeah"!

68
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,500
If you could get away with that
then there wouldn't be any hassle!

69
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,533
C'mon! Hmm... Umm...

70
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,033
Meroko, can't that handbook
be more helpful?

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,466
All right! I get it!

72
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,200
Soon I'll show my true power.

73
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,433
Oh, okay. Show me.

74
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,300
What kind of ideas do you have?

75
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,200
Th-That's...

76
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,500
To the manager...

77
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:51,400
Say, "I'm Mikatsuki, her little sister"
or something to fool him!

78
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,700
Won't that Wakaoji guy think it's strange?

79
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,700
T-That's why!

80
00:05:56,133 --> 00:06:00,200
Mikatsuki is gonna be
the stage name for her modeling work.

81
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,100
That's it! Let's do that!

82
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:05,800
Well, let's try that.

83
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,766
Yeah.

84
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:09,766
- You have to do your best!
- You have to do your best!

85
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,366
Okay!

86
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:21,900
This is the place.

87
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:22,666
Yeah.

88
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,133
Shall I go with you?

89
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,100
If she does that
it'll really be a pain—

90
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,566
A pain?
What will be a pain?

91
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:35,100
It would be such a pain
for you to do that.

92
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,800
Please go ahead and go shopping.

93
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:43,266
Well, I'll come back to pick you up,
so please wait in the lobby.

94
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,100
Okay!

95
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:48,266
Meroko...

96
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,800
Oh, that was bad...

97
00:06:52,766 --> 00:06:53,666
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:54,766
That's okay.

99
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:58,233
It was my fault for speaking so loudly
when I was in that form.

100
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,233
Do everything just
the way we said, okay?

101
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:01,833
Okay.

102
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:02,966
Is that so?

103
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:05,200
She's here?

104
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:06,266
Excuse me...

105
00:07:06,466 --> 00:07:07,800
We were waiting for you.

106
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:09,700
This is your manager, Ms. Oshige.

107
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:10,800
Say hello.

108
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,200
It's nice to meet you,
I'm Oshige from Village Pro.

109
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:19,066
<i>She's a woman.</i>

110
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:20,700
And this is...

111
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,800
N-Nice to meet you.
I'm Mitsuki Koyama!

112
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,300
Huh?

113
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,200
Fool, what are you saying?

114
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:29,033
You have to do it exactly
as we discussed it!

115
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,433
Oh! No I'm not,
I'm her younger sister Mikatsuki.

116
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,300
Younger sister?

117
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:34,833
Oh, well...

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,833
That's it!

119
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,733
Mitsuki! Take Dr. Wakaoji outside!

120
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:41,433
First you have to talk to him!

121
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:42,333
Y-Yeah.

122
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,700
Doctor, could I have a minute?

123
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:46,766
That's right.

124
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,200
So Mikatsuki is your stage name.

125
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,966
Yes, that's right, that's right!

126
00:07:51,266 --> 00:07:52,566
Well, what about being
the "younger sister"?

127
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,100
What?

128
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:55,633
Well that's...umm...

129
00:07:56,566 --> 00:07:59,833
because you'll be introduced
on the premise that

130
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:03,166
you're the younger sister of
another talent at the agency.

131
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,533
Hm? Is that right?

132
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:07,966
No, that's not it, but say it is!

133
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,100
Oh, okay!

134
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,633
It seems I'll be introduced as
the younger sister

135
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,466
of another talent at the agency.

136
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,600
Oh, I see!

137
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:17,700
But...

138
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:18,866
Is there something else?

139
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:22,333
Well, that's okay.

140
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,733
Hang in there, Mitsuki.

141
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,566
For things to work out well,
the first impression is always important.

142
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,033
The manager will take care
of you from now on,

143
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:32,600
so go and greet her properly.

144
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,400
Shall we return?

145
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:41,666
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:44,466
I hadn't listened closely to
what she had to say before.

147
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,800
Oh, don't worry about it.

148
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,800
To start over, this is Mikatsuki.

149
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:50,966
The younger sister.

150
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,766
A pleasure to meet you.

151
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,900
A pleasure.

152
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,466
Well then...

153
00:08:58,933 --> 00:09:00,500
So, where is she?

154
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:01,533
Where is "she"?

155
00:09:02,966 --> 00:09:04,500
Umm... Well...

156
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,766
That's it! School!

157
00:09:05,966 --> 00:09:08,366
Tell her, "She's at school"!

158
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:09,833
Is this gonna be okay?

159
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:10,900
It's okay!

160
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,566
At school.

161
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,566
Oh, at school.

162
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:18,233
Yes, she's going to school
just like she should.

163
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:21,766
See! Both of them
are satisfied with it!

164
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:23,333
Well, certainly.

165
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:24,766
Well, what shall we do?

166
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:26,333
Shall we wait?

167
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,666
Who should we wait for?

168
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:31,733
Say she'll be here soon!

169
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,200
Umm... She'll be here soon!

170
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:35,266
Okay.

171
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:41,700
Well, her guardian Dr. Wakaoji is here
so I'll roughly explain what's going on.

172
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,966
- Oh, yes...
- Dangerous, dangerous...

173
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,033
I wonder if it's okay like this.

174
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,900
Ms. Oshige, I'd like to
ask you something.

175
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,400
What would that be?

176
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,166
From now on she'll be busy...

177
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,700
You're worried about
the priority of her education.

178
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,800
Yes, there's that, too.

179
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:04,466
And your throat.

180
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:07,200
That is no problem.

181
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,800
We have many kids
who are her age.

182
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,133
Essentially, we only have them work
after school or on Saturdays.

183
00:10:16,466 --> 00:10:18,100
I'm relieved to hear that.

184
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,866
For the moment,
her debut will be the biggest event.

185
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,166
She was chosen at a massive audition

186
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,833
and she's a newcomer, so we want her
to debut as soon as possible.

187
00:10:29,866 --> 00:10:31,066
We're working on it now.

188
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,600
And to achieve that,

189
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,400
there will of course be voice training
and dance lessons,

190
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:40,500
she'll receive basic training like that.

191
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,100
What?

192
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,600
Wait a minute!

193
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:45,166
Voice training and other stuff,

194
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,200
it's like she's becoming
a singer or something?!

195
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,200
Things are getting hairy!

196
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,900
Doctor, that's...

197
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:54,400
Yes?

198
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,500
What are we going to do?

199
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,433
Umm... Umm...

200
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:03,500
Not this.

201
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,200
Hello...

202
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:07,866
What's calling going to do?!

203
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:09,200
Telephone?

204
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,766
Oh, could you call her?

205
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:15,366
Yes! Do that,
and we'll go away temporarily!

206
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,100
H-Hey!

207
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,166
Just now...

208
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:23,366
A belly roll?

209
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,533
Somehow I don't know
what's going on anymore.

210
00:11:43,566 --> 00:11:45,266
You are so slow.

211
00:11:45,266 --> 00:11:46,700
It's simple, isn't it?

212
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:48,866
Ms. Oshige is the manager and

213
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:52,633
she thinks that Mitsuki
is her little sister Mikatsuki.

214
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:56,766
Dr. Wakaoji thinks that Mitsuki
will make her debut

215
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,066
with the stage name Mikatsuki.

216
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:00,966
It's going well so far.

217
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,133
But if Dr. Wakaoji finds out
that I'm going to be a singer...

218
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:09,900
Then everything will get
all messed up.

219
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:13,100
We have to do something
about that.

220
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:18,933
Just like we thought,
I should tell Dr. Wakaoji the truth...

221
00:12:19,266 --> 00:12:24,200
There's no reason for him to suddenly
believe something ridiculous like that.

222
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:24,966
Right!

223
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:28,900
You're the only human who can
see Meroko and me, right?

224
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That's right.

225
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:33,300
How is he going to believe
that we're Death Spirits?

226
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,266
But that's the only way...

227
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,900
Oh, what shall we do with you?

228
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:46,800
Mero-Mero Change!

229
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,566
How about it?

230
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,266
There are two of me.

231
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:00,366
How about it?

232
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,000
Meroko, you...

233
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:04,600
I'll just have to
do something about it.

234
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:07,600
As the leader
of Green Onion Ramen,

235
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:09,866
the Death Spirits who can
quiet even crying children.

236
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,666
I can handle it!

237
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:13,833
Doctor...

238
00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:15,400
Mitsuki.

239
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:17,200
I was worried.

240
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:18,400
Where did you go?

241
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,200
Sorry, I don't feel so good.

242
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:25,466
Then shouldn't you
lie down for a little bit?

243
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:27,900
No! I'm just fine now!

244
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,866
Really?
Then I guess it's all right.

245
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,166
Her voice is a little different.

246
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:33,833
Oh, no.

247
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,900
And her personality
is different too.

248
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:38,033
Oh no,
it's just your imagination.

249
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,366
By the way, Mitsuki.

250
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:40,866
Yes?

251
00:13:41,566 --> 00:13:44,966
Something Ms. Oshige
said is not quite clear.

252
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,066
What is it?

253
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,466
From the story I heard,

254
00:13:47,566 --> 00:13:50,700
I can only think that you passed
an audition to be a singer.

255
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:52,633
That's...

256
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:56,366
That's it, a commercial!
She's talking about a commercial!

257
00:13:56,466 --> 00:13:57,366
Oh, really?

258
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,000
Yep.

259
00:13:58,133 --> 00:14:01,600
In it, I play the part of a girl
making her debut as a singer.

260
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:04,700
Well, let's get back quickly
to Ms. Oshige,

261
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,433
since we're in the middle of
talking and everything.

262
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,366
Oh, I see.

263
00:14:08,566 --> 00:14:09,600
Well done.

264
00:14:09,633 --> 00:14:12,000
Thinking of things
one after another.

265
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,166
Somehow I feel like things
are gonna start coming apart.

266
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:18,166
The doctor is satisfied with it.

267
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,600
What in that look on his face
says he's satisfied?

268
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:24,600
Well, then I have another good
move up my sleeve.

269
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,666
Oh?! Dr. Wakaoji, over there!

270
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:27,666
Huh, what?

271
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,700
You have an urgent patient, hurry!

272
00:14:31,066 --> 00:14:33,166
An urgent patient, hey!

273
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:34,200
Huh?

274
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,700
H-Hey! Hey!

275
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:41,400
While the doctor is gone,
I'll use this chance to...

276
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,500
Mero-Mero Change!

277
00:14:49,966 --> 00:14:50,666
How do I look?

278
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,300
Meroko, again?

279
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:56,166
Anyways, I'll go ahead and
take care of that manager.

280
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,933
I mean, I will see to
the manager.

281
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,500
Don't talk like that now.

282
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,433
Well, if we're going to do anything
that would be the quickest...

283
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,400
<i>I wonder if this is really okay...</i>

284
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:11,733
Huh?

285
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:15,600
Umm... Do I look strange to you?

286
00:15:15,766 --> 00:15:17,266
N-No. The girl is...

287
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:21,066
Oh, it seems that she's
not feeling very well.

288
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,500
Huh?

289
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:25,000
However, right now
she's resting, so it's okay.

290
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,600
Oh, I see.

291
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,600
Your language is strange again!

292
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:30,066
I know!

293
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,566
But more importantly,
I've decided!

294
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,433
I trust you, Ms. Oshige,

295
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:37,766
and I'm going to leave everything
about Mitsuki up to you!

296
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:40,133
I feel the same.

297
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,166
How are we going to explain this
to that doctor?

298
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:44,966
That's...

299
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:45,866
Oh!

300
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:51,333
Yes, this is Wakaoji!

301
00:15:51,966 --> 00:15:52,600
Yes...

302
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:53,300
Yes, yes...

303
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,533
I understand!

304
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:59,300
Ms. Oshige, there's someone to
see you in the parking lot.

305
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,166
To see me?

306
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,333
I wonder who...

307
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:06,866
Hey!

308
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,433
Again?

309
00:16:11,466 --> 00:16:14,100
This way, the whole mess will be settled.

310
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,200
I'm so tired.

311
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:21,933
Just as I thought.

312
00:16:21,966 --> 00:16:24,233
It's not good to leave this thing
just to Meroko and Takuto,

313
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,433
I'll come clean with
what's really going on!

314
00:16:26,566 --> 00:16:28,233
Oh, Mitsuki!

315
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,766
That urgent patient call
was absolute nonsense.

316
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,933
D-Dr. Wakaoji...

317
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:36,066
Now what?

318
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,166
A fire or something?

319
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:39,333
Or there's a wolf around here?

320
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:40,533
That's not it!

321
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,533
Umm... It wasn't a wolf but...

322
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:45,733
Umm...green onion ramen...

323
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,466
Just as I thought,
shouldn't you lie down?

324
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:51,633
Death Spirits
called Green Onion Ramen...

325
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,266
What are you two doing there?

326
00:16:55,433 --> 00:16:56,800
Well, come on in.

327
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,400
All we can do is
leave this up to Meroko.

328
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:10,800
Doctor Wakaoji...

329
00:17:10,866 --> 00:17:11,600
Yes...

330
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:13,066
Mitsuki is awesome...

331
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,233
Umm... Extremely?

332
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,400
Anyway... She's a good girl and I think
she is quite the talent!

333
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,666
Oh, really?

334
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:25,500
Please! Trust me and
leave Mitsuki in my care!

335
00:17:25,766 --> 00:17:26,933
Y-Yes.

336
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,766
Oh, progress...

337
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,300
There was no guest
there to meet me!

338
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:43,333
What do you mean a guest?

339
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,033
Well, you said it earlier,
Dr. Wakaoji.

340
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,966
I did?

341
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:48,933
Well anyway!

342
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:52,033
From now on please take good care
of Mitsuki Koyama!

343
00:17:53,066 --> 00:17:54,033
The same goes for me.

344
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,100
And the same for me.

345
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:57,300
Yes!

346
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,066
Well I really want Mitsuki
to do her very best.

347
00:18:07,366 --> 00:18:11,933
As your doctor,
all I can do is give you medical advice.

348
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,400
But above all,

349
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:18,433
I intend to be there for you
like a surrogate father.

350
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:20,133
Doctor...

351
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,633
Work hard.

352
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,733
Dr. Wakaoji!

353
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:43,733
Mitsuki! Come here...

354
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,833
Are you okay, Meroko?

355
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,166
It's all because
this is the first time

356
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,700
she's made this many
transformations in one day!

357
00:18:56,633 --> 00:18:57,800
I think she's reached her limit.

358
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,533
I'm still fine.

359
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,466
Who should I
transform into next?!

360
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,933
I think Takuto would be good.

361
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:08,700
Umm... Dr. Wakaoji?

362
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,000
Yes?

363
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,400
I'm sorry if I'm mistaken,

364
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,500
but didn't you play keyboard
for "Route L"?

365
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,666
Yes, well...

366
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,666
I thought it was you.

367
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,933
I was a big fan.

368
00:19:23,966 --> 00:19:24,966
I see...

369
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:27,733
I was a really big fan.

370
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,500
One time we passed each other
in some studio.

371
00:19:31,766 --> 00:19:33,366
Of course at the time,

372
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,733
I wasn't behind the scenes,
but an idol.

373
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:37,900
But then I got nowhere.

374
00:19:38,433 --> 00:19:39,466
That's right!

375
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,300
Would you mind signing
something for me?

376
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,100
Oh! Does Mitsuki have a cell phone?

377
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,000
Oh, Mikatsuki.

378
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,133
Y-Yes?

379
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,433
Is Mitsuki still at school?

380
00:19:52,466 --> 00:19:53,433
What? Yes...

381
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:57,933
Actually, I was supposed to
give her a cell phone today.

382
00:19:58,566 --> 00:20:00,700
If she doesn't have this,
we can't contact her, right?

383
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:01,533
Yeah...

384
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:02,766
That's right...

385
00:20:02,866 --> 00:20:05,766
Well...I'll go to the school
and give it to her.

386
00:20:09,066 --> 00:20:10,200
Oh, just in time.

387
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
Well, goodbye.

388
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:13,666
What are you going to do?

389
00:20:13,966 --> 00:20:16,400
Even if she goes to school,
Mitsuki's not going to be there.

390
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,466
Takuto, please, make me sixteen.

391
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:23,666
I want to speak to her myself, properly.

392
00:20:24,633 --> 00:20:25,833
That's what you have to do.

393
00:20:46,966 --> 00:20:51,466
Now I can greet Ms. Oshige properly
as 16-year-old Mitsuki Koyama!

394
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:56,066
Ms. Oshige?!

395
00:20:58,466 --> 00:20:59,533
Mitsuki?

396
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,700
Yes! I'm sorry I'm late.

397
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,700
I heard from my sister that
you would be here, Ms. Oshige.

398
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,133
Yes, I'm glad we could meet.

399
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:09,733
Yes!

400
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,366
A pleasure to meet you...

401
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:12,633
I'm Mitsuki Koyama

402
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:17,366
A pleasure to meet you too,
I'm Masami Oshige from Village Pro.

403
00:21:22,033 --> 00:21:25,233
You're going to get really busy
from here on. Are you prepared?

404
00:21:25,266 --> 00:21:25,833
Hm?

405
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,600
I mean, you're a newcomer.

406
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,300
I'll guide you
from the very first step.

407
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,100
I'm depending on you!

408
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,133
Okay. Anyway, let's work hard!

409
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:37,700
Yes!

410
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,900
<i>Eichi! I have a manager!</i>

411
00:21:46,266 --> 00:21:49,800
<i>It's finally starting!
I'm going to be a singer!</i>

412
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,833
Well, the day has finally come for
Mitsuki to make her debut as a singer.

413
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:27,733
The producer is Kohei Takasu
He's really famous.

414
00:23:27,766 --> 00:23:29,333
Wow, that's impressive.

415
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:32,000
But she doesn't like the song
that he got for her

416
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:34,133
and has decided that she wants
to write all the lyrics herself.

417
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,633
But what does Mitsuki know
about songwriting?

418
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:37,500
Don't worry.

419
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:39,000
As long as she's with me,
everything will be OK.

420
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:43,433
But you gotta use your soul
to write songs...your soul!

421
00:23:43,566 --> 00:23:46,800
Next time on Full Moon:
"Thoughts on a Song"

422
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:48,133
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
