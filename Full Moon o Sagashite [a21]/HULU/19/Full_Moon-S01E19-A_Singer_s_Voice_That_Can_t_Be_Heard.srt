1
00:00:05,566 --> 00:00:06,366
What shall I do?

2
00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:10,500
Takuto tried to let Mitsuki go to an audition
despite my efforts to stop them!

3
00:00:10,633 --> 00:00:11,866
I had to do something about it!

4
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:14,700
Since then, I've tried to interfere
at every turn,

5
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:17,066
so that I could fulfill my duties!

6
00:00:17,466 --> 00:00:18,566
That actually worked out.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,700
And by the time they arrived
at the audition site,

8
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:22,166
it was all over and

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,200
the winner was about
to be announced.

10
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,700
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,600
Got that?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,766
Yes.

13
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,900
<i>The Mermaid Tear image character</i>

14
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,866
<i>will be Madoka Wakamatsu.</i>

15
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:18,333
No!

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,100
The assignment...is over.

17
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:52,900
Mitsuki!

18
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:56,533
Ms. Oshige...

19
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:01,900
Hey, you're running away?!

20
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,966
Mitsuki!

21
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,666
You...

22
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,100
I'm sorry, Ms. Oshige.

23
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,700
I'm really sorry!

24
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,933
Why didn't you tell me about
your throat illness!

25
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:17,566
What?

26
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:21,866
Dr. Wakaoji!

27
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:24,066
W-What?!

28
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:28,933
Dr. Wakaoji, Mitsuki's right here,
so please take her to the hospital quickly.

29
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:32,500
Mitsuki? Do you, by any chance,
mean Miss Full Moon?

30
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:34,100
Isn't that obvious?!

31
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,933
She's not the Mitsuki I'm talking about.

32
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:37,700
What?

33
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:39,333
<i>Oh no, what should I do?</i>

34
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,800
Who in the world...are you?

35
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:45,233
What are you saying?!
The genuine, authentic Mitsuki!

36
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:46,466
Run away!

37
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,166
What?

38
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:50,066
Mitsuki?! Wait a minute!

39
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,166
Mitsuki!

40
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:55,966
Mitsuki!

41
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:57,733
Mitsuki!

42
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,933
It seems they're not after us.

43
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:05,933
What should I do?

44
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:10,600
I think they realize that Full Moon
and the 12-year-old me are the same.

45
00:04:10,766 --> 00:04:12,066
No way!

46
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:16,433
There's no way in the world
they'll think you transformed!

47
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,966
Oh, I can't go back to the two of them.

48
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:22,833
And I can't go on as Full Moon.

49
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,266
Mitsuki...

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,700
Here.

51
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,566
Lift your head up.
Let's get away from here.

52
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:37,100
Y-Yeah.

53
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,333
They're a little bit big,
but put up with it.

54
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,500
I also wanted to let her do what
she wanted with the time that was left.

55
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:54,400
I feel bad for her, but becoming
Full Moon was not a good idea.

56
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,033
Dr. Wakaoji, hurry!

57
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,300
The girl shouldn't have gotten very far!

58
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,533
Like I told you, I didn't come for that girl,
I came to look for Mitsuki.

59
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:10,900
And that's the girl, right?

60
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,333
I believed your phone call and came,

61
00:05:13,366 --> 00:05:16,200
but it can't be helped if
the essential Mitsuki doesn't appear.

62
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,133
Anyway, I'll search for Mitsuki myself.

63
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh, Dr. Wakaoji!

64
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,466
Fine! I'll look for her by myself!

65
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,200
Fool!

66
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:47,600
C'mon, why are you
so absent-minded?

67
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:48,900
It's dangerous!

68
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:49,966
Y-Yeah.

69
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,800
I can't let you die yet.

70
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:54,933
You're...you're...

71
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,900
Hey, isn't that Full Moon?

72
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,733
Huh? That can't be.

73
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,633
There's no way she'd be
in a place like this.

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,833
But...

75
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,500
<i>What should I say at times like this?!</i>

76
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:16,066
Ma'am, would you like
iced barley tea or something?

77
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:17,266
No, thank you.

78
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,333
But you must be tired from walking.

79
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,466
I'm fine.

80
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:32,433
<i>Why?</i>

81
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,500
I see, so you haven't seen her.

82
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:39,433
Thank you.

83
00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:44,533
<i>Where in the world are you, Mitsuki?</i>

84
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,366
Yes!

85
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:56,600
As her promoters, we'd like to refrain from
any official comments at this time.

86
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,566
No, nothing like retirement.

87
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,466
Yes... Yes!

88
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,833
If that's all.

89
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:04,766
Jeez! What's going to happen?!

90
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm sorry!

91
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:09,133
If this continues, we'll be all
off schedule starting tomorrow!

92
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,133
I understand.

93
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:12,600
I'll definitely find her today!

94
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:17,766
Hey, it's the manager's car.

95
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,733
<i>Just this instant,
a car believed to be carrying</i>

96
00:07:20,766 --> 00:07:24,033
<i>someone connected to Full Moon
hastily left the office.</i>

97
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:27,300
<i>Mr. Takeda,
you've met Full Moon</i>

98
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,600
<i>in interviews for magazines
and things, haven't you?</i>

99
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,733
<i>Yes.</i>

100
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:35,200
<i>It isn't long after her debut,
but she's a very pure, good girl.</i>

101
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:37,700
<i>She was too naïve.</i>

102
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:40,433
<i>She went into the entertainment industry
without taking it seriously.</i>

103
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:43,466
<i>She probably got tired of it
and gave up.</i>

104
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:48,300
<i>No, she's a singer who's tough
on the inside.</i>

105
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,566
<i>To think that it's over like this...</i>

106
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:53,166
<i>I don't want to believe it.</i>

107
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,600
At last I've come to the edge.

108
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:02,733
Eichi...

109
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:07,966
I might not be able to reach you
with my songs anymore.

110
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,533
Where am I?

111
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:05,900
Oh, I'm in the lighthouse.

112
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:10,266
I wonder where Takuto went.

113
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,833
The moon pendant that Eichi gave me.

114
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:21,600
It broke.

115
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,733
I wanted to cherish it forever.

116
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,566
At that time I made a decision
to protect you.

117
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,500
A song?

118
00:09:41,766 --> 00:09:47,600
Why can't I make this
a good memory?

119
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:49,166
Too far, too close...

120
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,666
That's my song.

121
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,666
I can't reach it.

122
00:09:53,966 --> 00:09:57,100
"Let's forget about it."

123
00:09:57,133 --> 00:10:01,100
The more I tell myself
to forget about it,

124
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,400
<i>This voice is so soothing.</i>

125
00:10:03,533 --> 00:10:06,366
the memory of you becomes greater.

126
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,266
<i>Who in the world is it?</i>

127
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,833
What? What?!

128
00:10:29,033 --> 00:10:30,000
<i>Takuto...</i>

129
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:42,466
Like a lost crying child
looking for something.

130
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:55,500
There's no eternity there.

131
00:10:55,733 --> 00:11:01,000
"You don't have to trust anyone."

132
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,033
You said.

133
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,700
Are we both the same?

134
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:19,200
At that time I made
a decision to protect you.

135
00:11:19,466 --> 00:11:25,200
Why can't I make this
a good memory?

136
00:11:25,466 --> 00:11:31,466
Too far, too close...
I can't reach it.

137
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:34,433
"Let's forget about it"

138
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:37,866
The more I tell myself
to forget about it,

139
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:43,666
the memory of you
becomes greater.

140
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,966
<i>Somehow it's heartbreaking.</i>

141
00:11:50,966 --> 00:11:55,000
<i>That's right, I'm the only person
who can hear Takuto's singing.</i>

142
00:11:56,233 --> 00:12:00,066
<i>That's right, even though that's
not the case for my singing...</i>

143
00:12:03,533 --> 00:12:05,633
<i>To that many people...</i>

144
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:07,300
<i>Even to Takuto...</i>

145
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:11,300
<i>Furthermore...</i>

146
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,933
<i>Surely sometime to Eichi.</i>

147
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:20,400
<i>I still want to sing after all!</i>

148
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,366
What are you doing?

149
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:24,966
What?

150
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,700
Umm... Well...

151
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:34,066
They've always said the early bird
gets the worm, so, uh...

152
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:35,333
What are you talking about?

153
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,466
Well? What are you going
to do from now on?

154
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,400
What do you mean,
"what will I do"?

155
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,633
Why don't we just
go to America?

156
00:12:58,866 --> 00:12:59,600
What?

157
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:04,133
Going to America and singing
may be a faster way to reach Eichi.

158
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:07,633
America, huh?

159
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:12,266
Maybe I'll do that.

160
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:13,200
Huh?

161
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,766
I guess going to America is a good idea.
I've got nothing to lose.

162
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,400
Mitsuki...

163
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,333
But...I wonder if it's okay.

164
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,600
What?

165
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,100
My English.

166
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,866
What?

167
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,133
You know, "Love Me Do."

168
00:13:27,966 --> 00:13:30,400
I read it like "Rabu mee doh."

169
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,900
At last, your smile has returned.

170
00:13:47,366 --> 00:13:49,266
You're better when you're laughing.

171
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:52,566
<i>Takuto...</i>

172
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,233
It's pretty.

173
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:03,800
Yeah.

174
00:14:08,866 --> 00:14:09,466
Takuto...

175
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,433
Yes?

176
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:16,900
I think I'll confide in Dr. Wakaoji
and Ms. Oshige about everything.

177
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:17,833
What?

178
00:14:17,866 --> 00:14:22,100
And if I tell them everything and
they don't forgive me, it can't be helped.

179
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:25,933
Even so, I want to sing.

180
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:33,300
But Takuto, I'm going to tell them
about Death Spirits, is that okay?

181
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:36,366
You should do what you want.

182
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,733
I'll always be there
to support your dreams.

183
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,733
Thank you, Takuto!

184
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:46,100
F-Fool! Don't hug me for no reason!

185
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:49,366
I...I like your singing Takuto.

186
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:50,833
I thought you were listening.

187
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:57,900
After all, it shows that
you're a kind person.

188
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,200
Again! Saying such
embarrassing things!

189
00:15:04,566 --> 00:15:06,400
But it's the truth!

190
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:15,500
<i>Don't use words such as "like" so easily.
Stupid Mitsuki.</i>

191
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:22,933
<i>Especially when
the one you like best is Eichi.</i>

192
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:33,300
Mitsuki!

193
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:37,900
Dr. Wakaoji, Ms. Oshige...

194
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:39,700
I'm sorry that I've caused you trouble.

195
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,700
What?

196
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,100
Mitsuki, do you have a fever?
A cough?

197
00:15:43,466 --> 00:15:44,400
I'm fine.

198
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:46,200
Well anyway, let's rest in a hospital room.

199
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,866
I'll call your grandmother
right away.

200
00:15:47,966 --> 00:15:49,533
No, Dr. Wakaoji.

201
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,733
I came because I have
something to tell you.

202
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,766
Hm? Something to tell me?

203
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:57,066
You're Mikatsuki,
Mitsuki's little sister, aren't you?!

204
00:15:57,466 --> 00:15:59,766
Isn't that what you told me
when we met once before?

205
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,100
I'm sorry, at that time...

206
00:16:03,566 --> 00:16:05,000
I told a lie.

207
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:05,933
What?

208
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,400
Ms. Oshige, I'm Mitsuki.

209
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:11,866
Okay, well... What about Full Moon,
who I always meet?

210
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,933
That's me too.

211
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:15,800
Th-There's no way that's true.

212
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,900
That's why I came to talk to you.

213
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,733
Mitsuki!

214
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:23,600
Be firm.

215
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:24,800
Yeah.

216
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:37,733
Dr. Wakaoji, do you remember the day
that I asked you about the audition?

217
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:38,833
Yes.

218
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:43,066
The truth is, after you went home,
something happened.

219
00:16:45,433 --> 00:16:49,533
A Death Spirit named Takuto
appeared before me.

220
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,600
He said that I had one year to live.

221
00:16:58,233 --> 00:17:01,433
This talk of a Death Spirit saying you
have one more year to live, that's just—

222
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:04,400
Ms. Oshige, let's listen to a little bit
more of what she has to say.

223
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,533
Y-Yes.

224
00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:07,033
Continue.

225
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,066
Yes, I heard that and thought that

226
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:15,633
this is my only chance
to audition and become a singer.

227
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:20,000
But...for that audition you
had to be 16 years old.

228
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,866
So then Takuto...

229
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:23,600
<i>Okay.</i>

230
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:28,433
<i>I'll make you sixteen years old.</i>

231
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:41,833
Since then, I've been able to transform
into 16-year-old Full Moon.

232
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,366
Only I can see Takuto,

233
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,833
so I understand why you can't easily
believe what I've said just now.

234
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,066
But if you don't believe me,

235
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,800
I won't be able to become Full Moon
and sing again.

236
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,633
I understand what you've said,
but I wonder if it's reality.

237
00:18:09,266 --> 00:18:10,266
Well, well.

238
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,333
If you tell them and they don't believe you,
all there is to do is show them.

239
00:18:14,366 --> 00:18:15,366
Takuto!

240
00:18:16,066 --> 00:18:16,900
Okay?

241
00:18:17,533 --> 00:18:18,233
Yeah.

242
00:18:22,466 --> 00:18:25,066
Dr. Wakaoji, Ms. Oshige...

243
00:18:25,466 --> 00:18:29,666
So you know that I'm not lying,
please watch.

244
00:18:30,566 --> 00:18:32,200
Takuto... Please.

245
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,033
Yeah.

246
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:01,300
Dr. Wakaoji, Ms. Oshige,
this is the 16-year-old me.

247
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:02,766
Mitsuki?

248
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,033
Can you believe what I've said?

249
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:20,133
H-Hey, Mitsuki, is this true?

250
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:23,833
Are you possibly showing us
some magic?

251
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:29,300
You were shown right before your very
eyes and you still don't believe it?

252
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:30,833
What's this?!

253
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,833
It's Takuto.

254
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:33,700
I'm Takuto, the Death Spirit.

255
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,966
Normally I'm not in this form,

256
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,666
but I can't talk to you
unless I am in this form.

257
00:19:39,933 --> 00:19:42,800
You're truly...a Death Spirit?

258
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,766
All we can do is believe it,

259
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:50,600
Mitsuki borrows this Takuto's power
and transforms into a 16-year-old.

260
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,600
<i>If so, the things that
happened up until now...</i>

261
00:19:55,866 --> 00:19:57,533
<i>It all make sense.</i>

262
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:03,133
But...to say that you only
have one year left,

263
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:05,666
that alone I don't accept.

264
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,966
Even if that's not so,
she can't put stress on her throat!

265
00:20:10,766 --> 00:20:14,733
But when she becomes
her 16-year-old self, she's perfectly healthy.

266
00:20:14,766 --> 00:20:15,400
What?

267
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,466
Really?

268
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:17,466
Yes.

269
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:18,933
That can't be!

270
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,966
If you don't believe, you should give
her an examination later.

271
00:20:22,633 --> 00:20:25,433
So that's why, Doctor,
I want to continue singing.

272
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,733
Please!

273
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,666
Not a chance, Mitsuki.

274
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,933
Why?!

275
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,133
I don't have time.

276
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,100
In the time I have left,
I want to continue singing.

277
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,200
I want to reach Eichi
as soon as possible.

278
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,800
And then...

279
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,833
That's not it.

280
00:20:48,866 --> 00:20:49,366
What?

281
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,533
It's not singing or life.

282
00:20:51,566 --> 00:20:55,200
You sing to live, and live to sing.

283
00:20:56,266 --> 00:20:57,200
Ms. Oshige...

284
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,266
Dr. Wakaoji!

285
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,066
Can't you do something for Mitsuki?

286
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:10,200
Until she's realized her dreams,
if only for that interval.

287
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:13,633
Please! Dr. Wakaoji!

288
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,400
Mitsuki, can you give me a little time?

289
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,200
I'd like you to let me think.

290
00:21:22,266 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm thinking that I'd like to do
everything I can for you.

291
00:21:25,966 --> 00:21:27,466
It's your life, after all.

292
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,566
And I want to let you walk down
the road that you wish.

293
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,233
Dr. Wakaoji said what he did.
Cheer up, Mitsuki.

294
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:43,533
Okay.

295
00:23:18,566 --> 00:23:20,833
Hey Takuto, are you going
to let things continue as is?

296
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,300
Meroko left.

297
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:24,600
Jeez! Aren't you angry?

298
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,466
It's her fault that you didn't
make the audition.

299
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:29,133
That's true

300
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,933
I'm sure that Meroko had
her own reasons.

301
00:23:32,266 --> 00:23:35,200
C'mon, how easygoing
can you be?

302
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:39,533
I don't care! If she wants to come back,
she can come back on her own.

303
00:23:39,633 --> 00:23:41,166
Oh, Takuto!

304
00:23:41,966 --> 00:23:45,133
Next time on Full Moon:
"Meroko, All Alone."

305
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,700
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
