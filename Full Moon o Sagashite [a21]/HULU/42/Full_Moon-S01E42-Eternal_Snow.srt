1
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:12,700
<i>This looks like Eichi's room.</i>

2
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,100
<i>What is this cold feeling?</i>

3
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:26,866
<i>A shadow filled with the smell of death</i>
<i>surrounds this house.</i>

4
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,233
<i>Why? What's going on?!</i>

5
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:22,933
You need to put it out of your mind.
That was an unfortunate accident.

6
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:24,933
But...

7
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:26,666
They were...

8
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,733
They were so happy.

9
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:33,233
Why did they have to...

10
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,766
<i>No way!</i>

11
00:02:57,566 --> 00:03:00,100
DEAR GRANDMA,

12
00:03:00,866 --> 00:03:04,100
Who are you writing the postcard to?
A friend from school?

13
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:06,266
No, to my grandmother.

14
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:10,366
Because I left Grandma's home
in that manner.

15
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:14,000
And also...because I'm
worried about her.

16
00:03:16,566 --> 00:03:17,966
You're very kind, Mitsuki.

17
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,766
Huh?

18
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:20,833
Because you're very considerate
of your Grandma at a time

19
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:23,766
when your head is probably
filled with thoughts of Eichi.

20
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:26,400
N-No it isn't.

21
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,300
You don't have to hide it!

22
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:29,766
<i>- That's right.</i>
- I'm not hiding anything!

23
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,233
<i>- I wonder whether he figured out</i>
- But you're blushing!

24
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:32,633
<i>the meaning of Eichi's name</i>
<i>appearing backwards.</i>

25
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,200
<i>- Hey, hurry up, Takuto!</i>
- Stop it, Ms. Oshige!

26
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,633
I can't believe it.
No way.

27
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:48,600
Before it happened,
I had a bad premonition.

28
00:03:49,466 --> 00:03:52,100
When I think to myself
that didn't I stop them...

29
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:55,666
You can't think about
stuff like that now.

30
00:03:57,466 --> 00:04:00,833
But they were
living so happily.

31
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:03,833
To think that all three of them
had to die.

32
00:04:05,866 --> 00:04:07,766
That too is our fate.

33
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,166
We have no choice
but to accept it.

34
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:14,566
I can't believe it.

35
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:19,900
Mitsuki worked hard
to see Eichi.

36
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:29,466
<i>You want to become</i>
<i>a singer that much?</i>

37
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,866
<i>Yep...it's a promise.</i>

38
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,933
<i>A promise to Eichi.</i>

39
00:04:36,266 --> 00:04:38,166
<i>I like you, Eichi.</i>

40
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,700
<i>I will work hard so that my songs</i>
<i>will reach you in America,</i>

41
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:44,166
<i>so wait for that day.</i>

42
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,833
<i>There's no point unless these feelings</i>
<i>are conveyed to you, Eichi.</i>

43
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:53,633
<i>Eichi...</i>

44
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:56,633
<i>Eichi...</i>

45
00:04:58,633 --> 00:04:59,700
<i>Eichi...</i>

46
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
<i>Eichi... Eichi has passed away.</i>
<i>If Mitsuki finds out...</i>

47
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,566
Those backward letters...
Don't tell me that...

48
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
We'll be there soon.

49
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:37,833
You'll get to see Eichi soon.
How do you feel?

50
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:40,966
You probably feel like you've
grown wings and can fly, right?

51
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:45,766
Yes, because I've worked hard till now
just so I could see Eichi again.

52
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:50,133
I see. If we continue down this road,
we'll get there.

53
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,866
Just be patient a little longer.

54
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:53,133
Okay.

55
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:56,766
<i>Takuto... What should we do?</i>
<i>We're almost there.</i>

56
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:09,500
What happened?

57
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:11,366
Could it be a flat tire?

58
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:14,233
I don't know,
but the car suddenly veered.

59
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,500
In any case,
let me take a look.

60
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:17,666
I'll look too.

61
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,600
Man, just when we
were almost there.

62
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:34,666
- Takuto...
- Huh? Takuto?

63
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:40,166
Could this be Takuto's doing?

64
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:41,833
What is it?

65
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:42,800
It's a flat tire.

66
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:46,200
Takuto!
Where in the world were you?

67
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,700
Go home right now!

68
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:48,400
Huh?

69
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,966
What?! Why?!

70
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,300
Because! Just go home!

71
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:56,700
No way! Tell me the reason!

72
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,733
I don't have a reason!
Just go home!

73
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:02,566
<i>It looks like it would be better</i>
<i>not to go to Eichi's house after all.</i>

74
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:06,200
Shall we go home for today?

75
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:07,700
Huh?! Why?!

76
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,933
You see, it was written in
the Death Spirit Handbook

77
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:13,166
that today is
a day of bad fortune!

78
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,866
Huh?

79
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,800
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Let's call this off for today!

80
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:18,600
If today's no good,
then when is?

81
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:21,800
Umm... Next week...
Let's do it next week!

82
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:23,900
See...

83
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:26,966
It's good fortune to visit
people next week. See?

84
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Huh?

85
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:30,233
It doesn't matter!
We're going to turn back!

86
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:33,866
Why?! I'm so close to seeing Eichi!

87
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,300
I can't let you see Eichi.

88
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,166
Why?!

89
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:40,366
You just can't.

90
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:43,866
You're awful!
Why do you say such mean things?!

91
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,366
That's right, I'm mean!

92
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,366
That's exactly what I am.
A mean guy!

93
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,333
Where's Mitsuki?

94
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,966
She's probably talking to Takuto.
But the mood feels different than usual.

95
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,800
Look, when I say you can't go,
I mean you can't go.

96
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,566
- Please understand.
- No.

97
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,200
Even if you say I can't,
Takuto, I will go...by myself.

98
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,900
H-Hey!

99
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,600
That's absurd,
saying you'll go alone!

100
00:08:16,366 --> 00:08:18,166
Come on,
let's go home, Mitsuki.

101
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,900
Hey, Mitsuki!

102
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,833
<i>Could that be...</i>

103
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:31,066
<i>Eichi's house?!</i>

104
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:35,766
Hey, Mitsuki! Don't go!
Today just isn't good!

105
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:38,300
No!

106
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:40,766
I will not let you go!

107
00:08:43,766 --> 00:08:44,433
Mitsuki!

108
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,600
I have been living for this day.

109
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:53,066
If I can't see Eichi, then what is
the meaning of all my perseverance?

110
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,766
I know that.
I know all that.

111
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,433
Then why are you
getting in my way?

112
00:08:59,766 --> 00:09:01,933
Eichi is so near!

113
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:04,833
You're wrong.
It's not like that.

114
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,166
Eichi isn't there.

115
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:09,033
Huh?

116
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,333
He isn't there.

117
00:09:11,866 --> 00:09:13,833
I don't understand
what you're saying!

118
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,966
I can't tell you more than this.
In any case, Eichi isn't there.

119
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:19,566
So let's go home.

120
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,533
Why isn't he there?

121
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:23,733
Why?!

122
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:36,400
Takuto!
Shouldn't you stop her?

123
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,233
- I can't stop her.
- Huh?

124
00:09:39,566 --> 00:09:41,800
I saw that expression
on her face.

125
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
I can't.

126
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,900
That Takuto... He always says
weird things when it comes to Eichi.

127
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:57,500
But I wonder what he meant
when he said Eichi isn't there?

128
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:54,166
Umm... Is this Eichi Sakurai's house?

129
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,133
Yes. Who are you?

130
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,133
My name is Mitsuki Koyama.

131
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:02,966
I came from Japan because
I wanted to see Eichi.

132
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:06,866
M-My goodness.
That's very far.

133
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,233
Please come in.

134
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:12,233
Thank you.

135
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,466
I apologize for coming here
out of the blue like this.

136
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,200
But I wanted to
surprise Eichi.

137
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:22,266
Who is this girl?

138
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,733
She came from Japan
to see Eichi.

139
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,666
What?

140
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,900
How do you do?

141
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:29,600
Umm... Where is Eichi?

142
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:35,100
A photo of Eichi!

143
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,666
Eichi isn't here.

144
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:44,500
U-Umm... What do you mean?

145
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,866
Eichi died two years ago.

146
00:12:08,233 --> 00:12:11,800
Eichi died two years ago.

147
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:13,133
Huh?

148
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,866
My son and daughter-in-law
adopted Eichi,

149
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,333
but all three of them died
in an automobile accident.

150
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:25,266
He...died?

151
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:34,200
<i>Mitsuki!</i>

152
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:40,933
Eichi...died?

153
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:47,800
That can't be true.
No way.

154
00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:52,033
That means that...
that Mitsuki's wish...

155
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,033
Mitsuki.

156
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Here.

157
00:12:59,066 --> 00:13:04,466
TO MITSUKI
This is a letter that Eichi left behind.
I've kept it unopened.

158
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:10,233
He probably never
intended to send it.

159
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:14,566
TO MITSUKI
I'm sorry that I have to give it to you
under these circumstances.

160
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,666
TO MITSUKI

161
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:28,233
Mitsuki!

162
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,700
Mitsuki!

163
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,733
Mitsuki! Mitsuki!

164
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,266
She finally fell asleep.

165
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
I see.

166
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,166
All that had happened...

167
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:04,500
I'm so sorry that you came
all the way from Japan.

168
00:14:04,966 --> 00:14:06,433
Don't worry about us.

169
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,466
But Mitsuki...

170
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:13,100
When I think of how
Mitsuki must be feeling...

171
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,033
Please stay awhile.

172
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,666
Thank you very much.

173
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:26,766
Why kind of a boy was Eichi?

174
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,300
He was a quiet
but thoughtful boy.

175
00:14:33,366 --> 00:14:36,066
He gradually became
accustomed to living here

176
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,966
and had just started
making a few friends.

177
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:41,833
But...

178
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,266
Mitsuki... I'm coming in.

179
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,466
<i>Eichi...</i>

180
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,166
Mitsuki!

181
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:24,600
Mitsuki!

182
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,266
Mitsuki!

183
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,133
Mitsuki! Where are you?

184
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:42,000
<i>Eichi... Where are you?</i>

185
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,800
<i>Eichi... Answer me.</i>

186
00:15:47,366 --> 00:15:49,200
<i>Eichi isn't there.</i>

187
00:15:51,266 --> 00:15:55,833
Why do you...
Why do you say things like that?

188
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:57,833
Eichi...

189
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,100
What's this?

190
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Eichi's...handwriting.

191
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:21,700
<i>Two months have passed since</i>
<i>I began living here in America</i>

192
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:26,600
<i>and I've come to realize</i>
<i>that I really do like you.</i>

193
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,600
<i>I like you even more than</i>
<i>I did when we lived together.</i>

194
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,100
<i>But I wonder if</i>
<i>you will forget me.</i>

195
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:43,466
<i>When I think that you may forget me</i>
<i>as time passes and we grow up...</i>

196
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:45,533
<i>To be honest, it's unsettling.</i>

197
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,000
<i>I don't want you to know that</i>
<i>I am such a pathetic man.</i>

198
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,666
<i>But it's okay since this is a letter</i>
<i>that you will never read.</i>

199
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,666
<i>I will express</i>
<i>my feelings honestly.</i>

200
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,566
<i>Mitsuki, I like you so much.</i>

201
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,833
<i>I like your sparkling eyes.</i>

202
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:13,566
<i>The way you live life</i>
<i>to the fullest.</i>

203
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:16,800
<i>Your dedication.</i>

204
00:17:18,866 --> 00:17:20,566
<i>The tranquility of your voice</i>
<i>when you sing.</i>

205
00:17:21,266 --> 00:17:23,366
<i>I wanted to tell you</i>
<i>I've always liked you.</i>

206
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:28,200
<i>I wish I had told you</i>
<i>many times that I liked you.</i>

207
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,800
<i>But I was too shy to say it.</i>

208
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,333
<i>But someday</i>
<i>we will meet again.</i>

209
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:43,466
<i>And that's when I'll tell you</i>
<i>that I like you...</i>

210
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,133
<i>until my voice is hoarse.</i>

211
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:56,466
Eichi... Where are you?

212
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:01,166
I want to see you.

213
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,933
Eichi...

214
00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:30,833
This is where you were?

215
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,500
Eichi...

216
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,900
<i>Wait!</i>

217
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:44,500
<i>Wait, Eichi!</i>

218
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:52,900
<i>Wait, Eichi!</i>

219
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,100
<i>Eichi!</i>

220
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,466
<i>Eichi!</i>

221
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:05,266
<i>I caught you!</i>

222
00:20:31,466 --> 00:20:32,700
<i>I can stop now, right?</i>

223
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:36,300
<i>I worked so hard</i>
<i>up to this point.</i>

224
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:41,600
<i>I persevered believing</i>
<i>that I would see you, Eichi.</i>

225
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:52,166
<i>But...I don't have to</i>
<i>persevere anymore, do I?</i>

226
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:56,800
Mitsuki, where are you?!

227
00:20:57,066 --> 00:20:58,466
Answer us!

228
00:20:58,766 --> 00:21:00,366
Mitsuki!

229
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,666
<i>Mitsuki...</i>

230
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:07,400
<i>Can't I be some kind</i>
<i>of support for you?!</i>

231
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,966
<i>I'll go to sleep here just like this.</i>

232
00:21:16,533 --> 00:21:21,800
<i>If I do that, I'll probably be by</i>
<i>Eichi's side when I wake up.</i>

233
00:21:22,566 --> 00:21:26,300
<i>I won't let anyone get between</i>
<i>me and Eichi any longer.</i>

234
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:36,733
<i>Eichi, please hurry and get me.</i>
<i>I'm here. I'll be right here.</i>

235
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,166
<i>Come here by my side, Eichi.</i>

236
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:46,800
<i>Hurry to me.</i>

237
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,933
I can't believe it.
Eichi is...

238
00:23:23,766 --> 00:23:27,366
What are we supposed to
say to her at a time like this?!

239
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,100
Takuto...

240
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:35,366
I won't give up.
I'll...I'll make her want to sing again!

241
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,533
I won't let it all come
to an end like this!

242
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:44,333
Next time on Full Moon:
"I Won't Sing Ever Again!"

243
00:23:45,066 --> 00:23:46,066
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
