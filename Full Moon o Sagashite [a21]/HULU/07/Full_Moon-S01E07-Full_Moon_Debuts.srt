1
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:07,633
This is Mitsuki Koyama,
12 years old.

2
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:10,933
The first day of recording for
her debut song "Myself" has finally arrived!

3
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:14,033
But Takuto, fell asleep in
his stuffed toy form and

4
00:00:14,066 --> 00:00:15,666
got kidnapped by a little girl!

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,500
He's so irresponsible!

6
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:19,833
Mitsuki was able to persuade
the little girl to return him,

7
00:00:19,866 --> 00:00:21,266
and the recording went off without a hitch!

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,466
Takuto! I won't tell
the boss about this!

9
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:27,833
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

10
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:33,633
Got that?

11
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:34,800
Yes.

12
00:02:09,266 --> 00:02:12,366
<i>Please continue to listen to my show!</i>

13
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,466
<i>Our spotlight song
this week is this!</i>

14
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,033
<i>On sale this week, it's "Myself."</i>

15
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,900
<i>By the Cinderella girl,
Full Moon,</i>

16
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,233
<i>who was chosen from among
10,000 people</i>

17
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:24,500
<i>at the Seed Records New Face audition.</i>

18
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:26,133
<i>It's her debut song.</i>

19
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:28,166
<i>It's produced by Kohei Takasu,</i>

20
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,400
<i>but the sound is distinctly different
from his usual sound.</i>

21
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:33,900
- Excuse me, please turn off the radio.
<i>- So it's worth paying attention to it.</i>

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,633
- I strongly dislike music.
<i>- So, let's listen to it.</i>

23
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,666
- Uh, yes...
<i>- It's Full Moon.</i>

24
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:44,733
Welcome home, Ma'am.

25
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:45,866
Where is Mitsuki?

26
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,033
She's in her room.

27
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:50,000
Is that so...

28
00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:54,000
Has there been anything
out of the ordinary?

29
00:02:57,366 --> 00:02:59,833
This comic is funny.

30
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:03,800
What's going on?
Mitsuki, that's disgraceful!

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,833
Yikes!

32
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,700
I'm sorry, Grandmother!

33
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,733
I'll be careful from now on!

34
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:22,900
Cripes.

35
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,766
Such a nag.

36
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:28,166
Ah, Takuto and the others are so lucky.

37
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,866
Right about now they're in Shibuya...

38
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:44,000
What are you doing
just standing around?

39
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,433
It's your first live show in a shop, right?

40
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:47,966
Where are you going to do it?

41
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:49,200
I wonder where?

42
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:49,933
Huh?

43
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:52,900
I guess it can't be helped,
I'll find it.

44
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,633
Where did your manager say it was?

45
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:58,133
She didn't say.

46
00:03:58,433 --> 00:04:00,633
She said if I went to
the main street I'd know.

47
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:02,766
Hey, where's the main street?

48
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:04,766
Over there.

49
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,800
You're such a country girl.

50
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,466
After all, it's the first time
I've been to Shibuya.

51
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:24,200
Anyways,
where in the world is it?

52
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,933
Why is everyone looking up?

53
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:39,166
Who's that?

54
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:40,866
It's that girl.

55
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,433
You know, the girl who was
chosen at some audition.

56
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:46,400
I know, they play
her song on the radio.

57
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:48,133
Oh, that girl.

58
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:50,033
Anyways, she's cute!

59
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:53,400
They say you're cute.
So now, what's your opinion?

60
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,233
What's wrong?

61
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:02,300
I wonder why.
Somehow it doesn't look like me.

62
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:07,233
You're feeling the difference between
your virtual image and your real self.

63
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:08,666
Is that so?

64
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,200
Please line up here.

65
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,866
Those of you who want to see Full Moon's
special live show today,

66
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,566
please line up over here.

67
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:26,766
Wow, this many people are lined up
for a new face even before her debut.

68
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,000
I-It's awesome.

69
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:31,100
I'm going to sing in front
of this many people.

70
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:32,133
Huh?

71
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:35,966
What's wrong?

72
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:38,200
A-Am I going to be able to sing properly?

73
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,533
What if I make a mistake with the lyrics?

74
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,566
In that case...

75
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,966
In that case?

76
00:05:43,366 --> 00:05:44,600
Cover it up by laughing.

77
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:45,900
I don't want to do that!

78
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,233
I worked so hard to write the lyrics.

79
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
If so, then sing it without
making mistakes.

80
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:54,200
I'm worried about whether I can or not.

81
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:57,633
Hey, hey, what are we going
to do about that now?

82
00:05:58,266 --> 00:06:00,466
More importantly,
you have to transform somewhere.

83
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:01,833
Over there.

84
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,233
Let's see, the waiting room is...

85
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,633
You're Full Moon, aren't you?

86
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,600
You don't remember me?

87
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,366
Uh... Have we met somewhere?

88
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,466
At the audition.

89
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,333
Ummm, umm...

90
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,233
You can't remember?

91
00:06:58,833 --> 00:06:59,600
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:01,866
I was supposed to go after you.

93
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:02,633
Huh?

94
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,700
My audition number was 22.

95
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:10,533
Thanks to you,
I was sent home without auditioning.

96
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,600
<i>The audition today is over.</i>

97
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:18,500
<i>We won't be having the third round
of auditions as planned.</i>

98
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,833
<i>I see, at that time...</i>

99
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,766
I'm so sorry.

100
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,433
Oh no, there's nothing to apologize for.

101
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:28,033
That's right.

102
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:31,933
If one person succeeds,
everyone other than that person fails.

103
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,600
Y-Yeah...that's true.

104
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:38,166
After all, I don't think that I lost to you.

105
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:38,866
Huh?

106
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:43,166
If our order had been reversed,
I would have succeeded.

107
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:46,166
Th-That's probably true.

108
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,400
After all, I sing much better.

109
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:53,400
She's got a lot of confidence.

110
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:55,466
I guess it's an advantage to be cute.

111
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,100
Huh?

112
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,433
What do you mean?

113
00:07:57,733 --> 00:07:59,600
Oh my, you don't know.

114
00:08:00,433 --> 00:08:03,500
You weren't chosen for your singing,
but you were chosen for your pretty looks.

115
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:07,333
If not, there's no reason
you would have been chosen.

116
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:10,066
You're singing isn't all that great.

117
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:13,700
I'm looking forward to
your live performance today.

118
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:16,100
With a CD, they can cover it up by
working on it,

119
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:18,433
but that can't be done with a live show.

120
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:20,933
To sing in front of people
time and time again

121
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:22,500
even though you're just a pretty face,

122
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:25,900
you probably don't know your own limits
so this will put you in your place.

123
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,200
For some reason,
that girl is really horrible.

124
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:34,266
Huh?

125
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,266
<i>I was chosen because of my looks?</i>

126
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,433
<i>Not my strength or my talent?</i>

127
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:44,266
Miss Full Moon's
Dressing Room

128
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,766
She's late.

129
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,966
That's right...

130
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,800
I wonder if she doesn't know
where the place is.

131
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,133
Yes!

132
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,900
She's here.

133
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,133
Ah, she's here, she's here.

134
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,200
Sorry I'm late.

135
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,133
Did you see it?

136
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,833
It's an awesome sign.

137
00:08:58,866 --> 00:08:59,600
I saw it.

138
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,966
It's because you're making
an appearance for the first time.

139
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:05,433
It was Mr. Takasu's idea
to make it really flashy.

140
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:07,066
What do you think,
were you surprised?

141
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,000
I was.

142
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,000
What?

143
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,000
Are you nervous?

144
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,100
N-No.

145
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,766
I...remember it too.

146
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:18,533
When you were an idol?

147
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,933
That's right.

148
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,200
It was my first time on
a stage since my debut.

149
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:25,033
I was singing on a poolside stage
in an amusement park.

150
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,133
Before the show I was super nervous.

151
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,233
Another idol saw that and told me

152
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,933
that at such times,
I should write on my palm

153
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:37,933
the word "hit."

154
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,566
And then, if you swallowed it,

155
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,866
you won't get nervous.

156
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:46,300
That's not right, Oshige.

157
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,633
It's not "hit,"
it's "hito," as in person.

158
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,733
What, is that true?

159
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:54,733
Th-Then, is that why I was unsuccessful?

160
00:09:54,966 --> 00:09:57,200
Ah, I've been cheated.
Darn it!

161
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:58,900
Give me my youth back!

162
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,466
Give it back! Give it back!
Give it back!

163
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,033
I don't think that's the reason
why you were unsuccessful.

164
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,833
Mitsuki, do it properly and write "hito."

165
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,833
Y-Yes.

166
00:10:10,366 --> 00:10:11,733
Ms. Oshige...

167
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,300
- Huh?
- Oh?

168
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:19,466
When I was chosen at the audition...
was it because of my looks?

169
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:22,500
Who told you that?

170
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:26,066
Who?

171
00:10:30,266 --> 00:10:31,933
That's quite offensive.

172
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:33,466
Well, this means
you're not a full-fledged star.

173
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,000
Was the singing meaningless?

174
00:10:37,866 --> 00:10:39,666
No, it wasn't meaningless.

175
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:41,800
I don't know who told you this,

176
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,866
but your success at the audition—

177
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,700
Uh, if we don't start to prepare soon...

178
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:48,333
We're pressed for time.

179
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:49,166
That's right.

180
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:50,933
Well, it's about that time,
I'm counting on you.

181
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:51,733
I understand.

182
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,466
Anyway, right now just think of
the live performance.

183
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:56,666
All right.

184
00:10:57,066 --> 00:10:57,933
Well, come this way.

185
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:01,766
Okay, me too.

186
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,933
It's amazing outside!

187
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:23,033
They're lined up all
the way to the sidewalk.

188
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,633
We'll make you glamorous.

189
00:11:48,366 --> 00:11:50,933
<i>I wonder...if I can really sing.</i>

190
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:15,666
Can I come in?

191
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:16,700
Yes.

192
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:19,666
Oh, where is she?

193
00:12:19,866 --> 00:12:20,933
The restroom.

194
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:21,933
Oh, is that so...

195
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,933
Mr. Takasu, would you like some?
It's a new kind of potato chip.

196
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,366
Oh, sounds good.

197
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:46,533
<i>To sing in front of people
time and time again</i>

198
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,200
<i>even though you're
just a pretty face,</i>

199
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:51,633
<i>you probably just don't know your own limits,
so this will put you in your place.</i>

200
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:05,100
So this is
where you are.

201
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,633
Takuto...

202
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:13,433
Takuto... I...

203
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,400
Huh?

204
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:17,400
Nooo!

205
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,233
W-What are you doing?

206
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:23,266
My hair's all rumpled!

207
00:13:23,766 --> 00:13:26,900
That's mean! They took the trouble
of making it so pretty!

208
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:29,333
You were worrying that
you're just a "pretty face,"

209
00:13:29,366 --> 00:13:31,900
but just as I thought, you were
thinking about your appearance.

210
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,200
Or better yet, how about putting on
a mask or something?

211
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,133
"The Birth of the World's
First Masked Idol."

212
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,633
It would be a big topic of conversation.

213
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:43,500
Where are you going?

214
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:44,533
Running away?

215
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,033
Sing properly, okay?

216
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:49,400
I can sing...
After all, it's my job.

217
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,200
Huh?

218
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:52,766
What?!

219
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:53,833
Huh? W-What?

220
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,733
Putting on airs...
What about your job!

221
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:58,333
"It's my job,
so no matter how painful it is,

222
00:13:58,366 --> 00:14:00,900
I'll work hard with my business smile."

223
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:03,000
That's not what I'm saying!

224
00:14:03,266 --> 00:14:06,333
If you sing with that cold face
because it's your job,

225
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,600
your singing won't echo
in anyone's heart.

226
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:09,166
Huh?

227
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,333
First, you have to sing
with pleasure from your heart.

228
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:18,833
It's true...
Yes, that's it.

229
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,366
But...right now, I...

230
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,800
I'll say it now,
but at the time of the audition...

231
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,366
At that time,

232
00:14:30,466 --> 00:14:32,166
I was so surprised I couldn't move.

233
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:33,266
Huh?

234
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:36,066
It's like...
you sing with such a beautiful voice.

235
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,366
Somehow it's not a "voice,"
but a "sound."

236
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:43,333
With no limit on the low notes,
it's as clear as a bell.

237
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:46,233
Like I was dreaming.

238
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,800
I was happy that this
kind of singer existed.

239
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,266
At that time I was happy too.

240
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,466
It had been a long time
since I'd sung so loudly.

241
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,833
It didn't become painful to breathe.

242
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,266
To other people it's normal,
but for me,

243
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,533
I was happy that I had
that kind of voice.

244
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:14,966
You can express your feelings
when you sing.

245
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,200
If you sing thinking "I'm not confident," then
you convey that to the people listening.

246
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:21,000
Yeah.

247
00:15:21,533 --> 00:15:23,266
Even so, I...

248
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,733
It's okay, it's okay.

249
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,833
Don't worry.

250
00:15:31,966 --> 00:15:33,233
Okay!
I'm going to go.

251
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:42,100
Ms. Oshige...

252
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:43,966
Mitsuki!
Look at that, look!

253
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,566
Huh?

254
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,100
What is this?

255
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:54,600
Amazing, it's a mountain of postcards.

256
00:15:54,966 --> 00:15:57,833
They're the postcards this shop
received to reserve your CD.

257
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,566
What?

258
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,266
I'm just telling you, these are only
the ones this shop's received.

259
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:14,066
Please reserve Full Moon's debut single,
"Myself" for me.

260
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,800
<i>I liked it the first time
I heard it on the radio.</i>

261
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,600
<i>It's a really good song.</i>

262
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:23,133
<i>It's the best.</i>

263
00:16:25,866 --> 00:16:27,733
<i>I wonder what kind of girl
is singing?</i>

264
00:16:27,866 --> 00:16:29,266
<i>I really like it.</i>

265
00:16:29,766 --> 00:16:32,433
<i>She's probably young,
but she's got a good voice.</i>

266
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,866
<i>It was like her feelings
were coming through.</i>

267
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:39,700
These are from people who
have only heard you on the radio.

268
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,333
You weren't just chosen for your looks.

269
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:45,400
You can believe that, right?

270
00:16:49,433 --> 00:16:50,166
<i>Eichi...</i>

271
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:53,666
It's difficult to become stronger.

272
00:16:54,633 --> 00:16:58,433
<i>But now I feel like I can start.</i>

273
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,233
<i>Surely...I...</i>

274
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,400
<i>am not alone.</i>

275
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:15,566
<i>Why do I like you so much</i>

276
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:22,366
<i>My tears are falling</i>

277
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:41,000
<i>Because in the past
there were a lot of things I lost</i>

278
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,566
<i>And I couldn't sing</i>

279
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:58,033
<i>A distant place was where I belonged.</i>

280
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:09,166
<i>I found a loneliness
in your eyes that day</i>

281
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,400
<i>Are we both the same</i>

282
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:22,300
<i>I realized you were
always next to me</i>

283
00:18:22,466 --> 00:18:28,400
<i>Why do I like you this much?</i>

284
00:18:28,433 --> 00:18:34,500
<i>Your voice echoes
and it sounds almost sad</i>

285
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:40,833
<i>Up to now who was supporting me?</i>

286
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:48,400
<i>I realize, now that I'm far away,
what was supporting me.</i>

287
00:18:55,733 --> 00:19:02,000
<i>Why do I like you?</i>

288
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:10,700
<i>That's too easy to answer.</i>

289
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,766
Mr. Takasu,
what a beautiful special effect!

290
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,833
It was an awesome production.

291
00:19:15,966 --> 00:19:18,333
Oshige, you really did it!

292
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,800
That was amazing, Mr. Takasu.

293
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,066
It was really amazing, Ms. Oshige.

294
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,300
It looks like
they both think the other did it.

295
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,766
Oh, it's you.

296
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,800
- I lost.
- What?

297
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:20,466
I'm nothing compared to you.

298
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,200
Your singing was amazing.

299
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,833
It's only natural that
you were chosen.

300
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:30,500
And...I'm embarrassed...
for what I said.

301
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:34,066
I'm really sorry.

302
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,966
I was confident in my singing,
but I'll work harder.

303
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,933
And I have to work harder than ever
to convey my feelings to everyone.

304
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,266
We both have to work hard.

305
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,500
I guess so!

306
00:21:02,466 --> 00:21:04,000
I thought you'd be here.

307
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:05,166
Thanks for earlier.

308
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,166
Growing wings.
It's nothing.

309
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,233
No...

310
00:21:10,266 --> 00:21:14,466
What you said before,
it really cheered me up.

311
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:16,133
Hey! Don't get the wrong idea.

312
00:21:16,633 --> 00:21:19,700
I hate wishy-washy, sensitive people.

313
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,633
Hey, are you listening!

314
00:21:28,966 --> 00:21:31,300
You conveyed your feelings...

315
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,700
properly...

316
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:20,766
Mitsuki's song is selling
like crazy!

317
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,166
I'm sure the kids at her school are
gossiping about Full Moon!

318
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,633
Naturally. The manager said
it was a big hit, too.

319
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:30,533
What? Nobody's talking
about Full Moon.

320
00:23:30,566 --> 00:23:35,233
Okay! If nobody's listening, I'll make
them listen! Leave it to me!

321
00:23:35,266 --> 00:23:36,633
Wait, Meroko!

322
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:39,833
If you go out, then everything
will get more confusing!

323
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:43,700
Next time on Full Moon:
"Is It Really A Hit?"

324
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,433
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
