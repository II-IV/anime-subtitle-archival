1
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:07,566
Meet Mitsuki Koyama,
12 years old.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,866
She had a shampoo commercial
audition today and I was with her.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,800
There we met this nasty girl.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,000
Her name is Madoka Wakamatsu.

5
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:16,766
It seems she has some kind of grudge
against Full Moon

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,466
and does nothing but harass her!

7
00:00:18,766 --> 00:00:19,766
And to top it off,

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,166
she even ends up complaining
about her passing the audition!

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,466
Jeez, it makes me mad!

10
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,766
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,600
Got that?

12
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:34,633
Yes.

13
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:13,766
We would like to have Miss Full Moon
and Miss Madoka Wakamatsu,

14
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,266
the two of you, in this commercial.

15
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,866
W-What's up with that?!

16
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:17,700
Madoka...

17
00:02:19,366 --> 00:02:20,900
I look forward to working with you.

18
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,900
Let's do our best together.

19
00:02:25,866 --> 00:02:27,600
Please decide on one person!

20
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:28,233
What?

21
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:29,500
I don't want to work with her!

22
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,366
Huh?!

23
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,200
<i>W-Why...?</i>

24
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,400
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

25
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,166
You see...

26
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,166
I'm concerned because Full Moon
and I have such different images.

27
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,200
I wonder if we can make
a good commercial.

28
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,766
Who'd be fooled by
such contrived acting?!

29
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:08,900
Hmm, you have a point.

30
00:03:10,866 --> 00:03:12,633
Hey, Kuwahara.

31
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:15,266
But, like I said, my vision is...

32
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:19,566
But sales will be totally different depending
on the character in the commercial.

33
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,266
That's why...

34
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:24,766
Umm, everyone's waiting.
Something must be done quickly.

35
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,766
<i>Madoka. Why...?</i>

36
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,133
Umm, thank you for waiting.

37
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,300
Getting right to the conclusion,

38
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:49,066
we will hold a camera test
for both parties.

39
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:52,766
And therewith, we will make
the final selection.

40
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:53,833
What?!

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,500
And so we will be deciding on
one person as planned.

42
00:04:00,766 --> 00:04:01,966
Thank you!

43
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,933
No kidding. That's too bad.

44
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,233
Is that it?

45
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,366
Don't you think that
Madoka Wakamatsu is terrible,

46
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,700
or Meroko's cute or anything?

47
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:19,266
Hmm... Well...

48
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:25,166
We're trying so hard!
Say something more!

49
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,900
So I'm saying that's
too bad, aren't I?

50
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:29,566
Not that.

51
00:04:30,566 --> 00:04:33,100
Cripes! Will you get serious
about this?!

52
00:04:34,966 --> 00:04:35,700
What?

53
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,433
Do you have a fever or something?
Maybe a cold?

54
00:04:37,466 --> 00:04:38,700
Wrong.

55
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:40,900
But your face is all red.

56
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,366
Th-This is...

57
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:45,966
Yeah, he really is all red.

58
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:48,066
Takuto?

59
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:49,966
I-It's that... You, too...

60
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:50,833
Huh?

61
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:52,300
Nothing.

62
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:55,500
Where are you going, Takuto?
I'm coming, too!

63
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:57,266
I'm going to the bathroom.
Don't be coming along.

64
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,333
The bathroom?

65
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,366
A Death Spirit shouldn't have
to go to the bathroom!

66
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:05,433
He's really acting strange.

67
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:06,966
It's like he's angry.

68
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:17,300
I need to chill out.

69
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:19,766
I'm the only one who's
all concerned about it.

70
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,800
I have to encourage her so
that she'll do well in the audition.

71
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:27,500
I wonder if Takuto is opposed to me
being in a commercial, after all.

72
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:28,633
Why?

73
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,766
He was a singer before
he died, wasn't he?

74
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:32,600
What?!

75
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,533
He might be thinking something like,

76
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:37,466
"appearing in a commercial
isn't necessary for music!"

77
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,233
Say, do you know what kinds
of songs he sang, Meroko?

78
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,900
Where did you hear
that Takuto was a singer?

79
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,800
Huh...? Well...

80
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:55,033
Takuto said before that
he sang songs when he was human.

81
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,833
You little jerk!

82
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,300
What're you doing
snooping around?!

83
00:06:01,766 --> 00:06:02,366
But...

84
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:05,066
Is it fun for you to probe
into someone's past?

85
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:08,333
Besides, it doesn't have
anything to do with you, does it?

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,733
Is it true that you
talked about it, Takuto?

87
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,700
Well...

88
00:06:11,766 --> 00:06:13,566
Why'd you talk about it?

89
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,833
And to a human at that?!

90
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:16,700
It's my business, right?

91
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:17,900
Your business?

92
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:19,800
Takuto, what's the big idea?

93
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,866
Nothing, nothing at all!

94
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:25,433
Just shut up.
I'm talking with her right now.

95
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:27,666
I'm talking to you, Takuto!

96
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:28,966
Get out of the way!

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,766
No!

98
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:31,033
I-I'm sorry!

99
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:33,466
I said something
I shouldn't have.

100
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,566
I was just wondering what
kind of songs Takuto used to sing.

101
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:37,700
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

102
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,700
Takuto!

103
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:44,100
Hey, Takuto!

104
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:45,100
I'm not finished.

105
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,233
Takuto!

106
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:47,800
Takuto!

107
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:56,533
It's your fault if something
happens to Takuto!

108
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,300
What...?

109
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,733
Takuto's wings are still replicas.

110
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:01,300
R-Replicas?

111
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,066
It means they're artificial!
They're not real.

112
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,133
Takuto is still a rookie and

113
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,833
he hasn't completely become
a Death Spirit yet.

114
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,300
He's immature.

115
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,133
It's dangerous while
he's still in that state.

116
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,700
If he recalls all of the memories
from the time he was human,

117
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,100
his soul will be pulled back
into this world.

118
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:19,800
What?

119
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:20,866
Do you get it?

120
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:24,233
He won't have a body to return to
and he'll turn into a ghost!

121
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,766
If you get it, then don't ever
say anything again to Takuto

122
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,000
that'll make him recall his past!

123
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,333
Meroko.

124
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:39,166
Meroko!

125
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,966
What should I do?

126
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,066
I did something terrible.

127
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,266
The two of them didn't come back.

128
00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:14,533
Meroko...Takuto...

129
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,866
<i>I wonder where they went.</i>

130
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:23,366
Mitsuki.

131
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:26,033
Mitsuki!

132
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:27,500
Oh... Uh, yes?

133
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:30,833
I'm sorry!

134
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:33,900
You seem kind of tired, Mitsuki.

135
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:38,633
As I recall, today's a school day, right?

136
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,233
If you're not feeling well, skip school
and we'll go to the hospital.

137
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:43,000
Oh no, I'll be okay.

138
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,466
It'll be okay, right?

139
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:57,700
I'm sure Takuto will come back
by tomorrow's audition.

140
00:08:59,133 --> 00:08:59,900
Takuto?

141
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:01,900
Oh, Tomoe.

142
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,400
Who's Takuto?

143
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:06,433
Oh... Well... Umm...

144
00:09:06,866 --> 00:09:09,233
I bet it's the name of
a person you like, right?

145
00:09:09,266 --> 00:09:11,200
No, you're wrong!

146
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:13,133
Don't hide it, don't hide it.

147
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,466
Come to think of it,
you suddenly look grown-up.

148
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,633
Something happened during
two weeks of the summer vacation, right?

149
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,466
I'm telling you,
nothing happened.

150
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,933
Then who's Takuto?

151
00:09:23,966 --> 00:09:25,033
Takuto is...

152
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,333
<i>To me, Takuto is...</i>

153
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,733
Takuto is a dear friend.

154
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,900
Yikes!

155
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:40,566
Are you okay?!

156
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:41,866
Uh-oh!

157
00:09:42,266 --> 00:09:44,500
- What're you guys doing?!
- Yikes!

158
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:52,766
All right.

159
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,366
Finally dry.

160
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,200
Thanks, Tomoe.

161
00:09:58,733 --> 00:09:59,433
<i>What?</i>

162
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:02,800
<i>My throat hurts a little.</i>

163
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:03,733
What's wrong?

164
00:10:03,766 --> 00:10:05,866
Oh, nothing.

165
00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:10,233
I'll scold those jerks and
teach them a lesson!

166
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,566
You don't need to do that.

167
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,166
You can't go easy on them.

168
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:18,433
It's proper to apologize
if you do something bad.

169
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:22,400
I see... You're right!

170
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,100
Thanks, Tomoe!

171
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:26,933
M-Mitsuki?

172
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:31,600
I'm home!

173
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,066
Takuto!

174
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,000
Meroko!

175
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:38,133
They're still not back.

176
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,000
I want to apologize properly.

177
00:10:44,066 --> 00:10:44,766
<i>Hello?</i>

178
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:46,066
Oh, Mitsuki?

179
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,833
Can you watch TV now?

180
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:51,466
<i>And so, it seems</i>
<i>Madoka Wakamatsu here</i>

181
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,266
<i>and Miss Full Moon will</i>
<i>be competing</i>

182
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,866
<i>for the coveted spot in</i>
<i>the new Mermaid Tear commercial.</i>

183
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,066
<i>Yes. It's an honor for me to be</i>
<i>with Full Moon who's so hot now.</i>

184
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,133
Whoa!

185
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,166
<i>It seems Madoka Wakamatsu's</i>
<i>office set it up.</i>

186
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,566
<i>They're trying to give her</i>
<i>the edge in tomorrow's audition</i>

187
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,933
<i>by monopolizing</i>
<i>the conversation.</i>

188
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:14,433
<i>But you don't need to get nervous.</i>

189
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,266
<i>Mr. Kuwahara, the director,</i>
<i>has made it so clear</i>

190
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,233
<i>that you're perfect for</i>
<i>his vision, after all.</i>

191
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:20,666
<i>- Please tell us about</i>
- Okay...

192
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,000
<i>your goal in</i>
<i>trying out for the final selection.</i>

193
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:24,166
<i>Yes. In this audition,</i>

194
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,033
<i>I hope to learn various things</i>
<i>from Miss Full Moon.</i>

195
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:36,300
Congratulations, Madoka.

196
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,233
Here you go.

197
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:44,266
Let me tell you one thing.

198
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:47,600
This won't make me change
my mind about the image.

199
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:53,200
I think only Full Moon can express
that mellow feeling.

200
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,366
Oh, no. That's not my intention.

201
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:59,433
It's just that Madoka was
really nervous yesterday.

202
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,333
I wanted you to see
her true self today.

203
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,433
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

204
00:12:06,566 --> 00:12:07,433
Oh!

205
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,933
Madoka?

206
00:12:09,466 --> 00:12:10,766
Hey, are you okay?

207
00:12:11,066 --> 00:12:15,866
Oww! I went and did it again. Oopsy!

208
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:20,966
I'm sorry. Madoka has
gotten nervous again.

209
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,900
Well...

210
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:25,666
Madoka's mellower than I thought, eh?

211
00:12:26,066 --> 00:12:29,866
She works very hard and
is often misunderstood.

212
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:31,900
Well, I'll be darned.

213
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,466
I guess the clients were
looking closely, after all.

214
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,733
Ohh, I'm embarrassed.

215
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,833
<i>I'll make myself the desired image</i>
<i>by any means necessary.</i>

216
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:46,933
<i>Full Moon, I won't lose to you!</i>

217
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:07,366
Takuto...

218
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:23,300
The pendant Eichi gave me.

219
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,900
Eichi, I said something that
hurt a very dear friend.

220
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:36,200
Please help me so that we can
be friends once again.

221
00:13:40,966 --> 00:13:41,866
Eichi.

222
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,600
<i>Takuto.</i>

223
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,033
<i>Where are you?</i>

224
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:21,000
<i>Come back.</i>

225
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:26,500
<i>Takuto.</i>

226
00:15:01,766 --> 00:15:02,800
Shouldn't you go?

227
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,233
The audition's tomorrow, right?

228
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:08,100
There shouldn't be any work today.

229
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,966
Then it'll just be the two of us today?

230
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,233
I'm happy!

231
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,466
Let's have a lot of fun and
just forget about yesterday, okay?

232
00:15:19,566 --> 00:15:21,566
That girl's really a bother, isn't she?

233
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:24,766
She can't do anything without you.

234
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,366
She should just think about Eichi.

235
00:15:28,766 --> 00:15:29,933
Right, Takuto?

236
00:15:29,966 --> 00:15:31,633
Shut up, Meroko!

237
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:34,500
Can't you keep quiet
even for a little bit?

238
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:35,466
Takuto?

239
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:38,200
<i>Jeez! How irritating!</i>

240
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:43,833
<i>I shouldn't have</i>
<i>said that I sang.</i>

241
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,566
<i>It was bound to interest</i>
<i>that singing idiot.</i>

242
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,566
<i>I was just wondering</i>
<i>what kind of songs...</i>

243
00:15:55,633 --> 00:15:58,866
<i>I forgot that stuff when I died.</i>

244
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,800
<i>That jerk.</i>

245
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:09,733
<i>I forgot!</i>

246
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,166
Takuto.

247
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:24,466
Takuto... Why won't you come?

248
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,400
I want to apologize.

249
00:16:30,433 --> 00:16:32,666
Summer's all about ice cream.

250
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,533
Madam won't be home until late,
so I'll just relax like this.

251
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:39,233
Mitsuki?

252
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,333
I wonder what she's doing there?

253
00:16:47,066 --> 00:16:48,000
Mitsuki!

254
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:51,933
Oh no!

255
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,633
Mitsuki!

256
00:16:54,966 --> 00:16:56,533
Mitsuki!

257
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:08,533
Dr. Wakaoji!

258
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:10,066
How's Mitsuki?

259
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,266
She has a high fever.

260
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:14,333
I can't say that she's in
very good shape.

261
00:17:15,366 --> 00:17:16,633
To be on the safe side,

262
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,700
she should probably stay
in the hospital for a few days.

263
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,433
Ma'am!

264
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,133
It's because she went
walking around on her own

265
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,300
even though I repeatedly
told her not to.

266
00:17:32,066 --> 00:17:33,600
She's the only one.

267
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:34,600
What?

268
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,833
She's the only kin that

269
00:17:37,866 --> 00:17:40,766
my daughter Hazuki left me.

270
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,133
Even if she's that man's child,
she is my grandchild.

271
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,066
I've had enough of those feelings...

272
00:17:49,866 --> 00:17:52,800
like those when I lost my daughter.

273
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,666
Where am I?

274
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,966
I didn't realize it was morning!

275
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,333
I have to go.

276
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,933
<i>Though, I can't audition</i>
<i>in this condition.</i>

277
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,366
<i>No, I'm sure Takuto will come.</i>

278
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:40,033
<i>I'm sure we can make up</i>
<i>if I apologize.</i>

279
00:19:00,466 --> 00:19:01,766
Today, at last.

280
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,166
The whistle isn't sounding...

281
00:19:04,566 --> 00:19:06,300
So I guess that girl gave up, huh?

282
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,633
Say, I've been thinking.

283
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,600
Since it's come to this,

284
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:14,866
let's ask the Death Spirit division chief
to change who's in charge of the girl.

285
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,066
Isn't it better for all of us?

286
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:23,866
Let me see, the procedure
in such a case is...

287
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,900
She's not the kind to give up.

288
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:26,966
Huh?

289
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,966
Takuto, don't tell me...

290
00:19:31,566 --> 00:19:32,533
She's waiting.

291
00:19:33,066 --> 00:19:34,433
I can't blow her off.

292
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,700
Takuto!

293
00:19:36,866 --> 00:19:38,000
Hey, wait!

294
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:42,766
Backwards letters again!

295
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,466
Ma'am!

296
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,166
Mitsuki isn't...
Mitsuki isn't in her room!

297
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,633
I have to hurry.

298
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,300
Here I rushed over here.
Where'd she go? Jeez!

299
00:20:18,366 --> 00:20:19,133
Meroko!

300
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:20,800
I won't let you go!

301
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,100
What's with the silly stunt?

302
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:24,700
Look at this!

303
00:20:25,566 --> 00:20:26,266
This is...!

304
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,366
Right. A message hastening
her death has appeared again.

305
00:20:30,966 --> 00:20:34,366
And the keyword is...audition.

306
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,433
So don't be transforming her
and helping with her audition!

307
00:20:40,566 --> 00:20:41,266
But...

308
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:48,000
We're Death Spirits.
We're here to let her live out her life!

309
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:49,166
I know!

310
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,433
No, you don't!

311
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,666
You don't at all, Takuto!

312
00:20:56,466 --> 00:20:58,700
Don't get involved with her.

313
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:04,633
I'm sick of you and that
girl being together!

314
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:07,166
I didn't want to say it,

315
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,333
but something about you
and that girl is similar.

316
00:21:13,033 --> 00:21:14,600
You're sure to recall the time

317
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:16,800
when you were human if
you associate any more with her.

318
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,266
You know what'll happen then, right?

319
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,466
- I love you.
- Huh?!

320
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,200
I never want us to part.

321
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:38,933
I don't want you to turn
into a ghost, Takuto.

322
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:20,800
Wait, Mitsuki!
I'm coming to get you.

323
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,100
Takuto, why do you back
that girl so much?

324
00:23:24,133 --> 00:23:25,366
I don't know myself!

325
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,866
But I can't just leave her,
so it can't be helped.

326
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,966
No. I won't let you go,
no matter what!

327
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,966
Takuto, you'll get in big trouble
if you stay by her side.

328
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,500
Get out of the way, Meroko.
I don't care what happens to me!

329
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:39,666
I'm...I'm going to help Mitsuki,
no matter what!

330
00:23:40,266 --> 00:23:43,833
Next time on Full Moon:
"Run to the Audition"

331
00:23:44,266 --> 00:23:46,166
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
