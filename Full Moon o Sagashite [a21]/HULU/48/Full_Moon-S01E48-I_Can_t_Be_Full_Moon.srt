1
00:00:05,066 --> 00:00:06,900
TAKUTO KIRA

2
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:08,900
W-What are you doing?!

3
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,933
Takuto! Do you understand
what this means?

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,700
What the heck is fate anyway?
It's stupid.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,500
I'm not gonna let Mitsuki die.

6
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:25,033
There's no way a half-baked guy like
you could do something like that alone!

7
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:27,933
Meroko! You...

8
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:29,100
Yeah!

9
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:30,233
TAKUTO KIRA
MEROKO YUI
Me too.

10
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:18,633
Live?

11
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:21,166
That's the title that I want to use.

12
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,866
You're using it to mean "to live"
as well as a "live concert" huh?

13
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:26,900
Yes.

14
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:28,566
I think it's a good idea.

15
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:34,033
Actually, I just used the word that
Takuto gave me the other day.

16
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:38,966
Well...if I could possibly...

17
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,333
What is it? Just tell us.

18
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:44,500
I would like to have
my live concert on that day.

19
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:46,866
The day I met Meroko and Takuto
for the first time.

20
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,400
My...well...

21
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:51,066
My last day!

22
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:55,133
Well, that's also the day
that I have a surgery.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,666
Well...

24
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,333
Can we not do that?

25
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,900
I guess I am
supposed to say "no."

26
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:08,533
But we can work something out.

27
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:11,133
Like, we can finish the check-ups
the day before.

28
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:12,866
Are you sure?

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,666
Yes.

30
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,200
Thank you very much!

31
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,333
See, you never know until you ask!

32
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,166
Yeah.

33
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,133
Sorry, Keichi.

34
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,433
No worries.

35
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:25,200
Okay, we need to get started now.

36
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:29,766
We have to reserve the site,
prepare ads, and promote to the media.

37
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:33,966
Mitsuki's concert...
We'll definitely make a hit!

38
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,433
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

39
00:03:47,433 --> 00:03:49,466
It'll be a pretty big stage, huh?

40
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:53,533
Okay, I'll do my best on the ads!

41
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,633
Thank you very much!

42
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:57,533
Thank you.

43
00:03:58,233 --> 00:04:02,766
Anyways, it's hard to believe it's been
a year since you debuted. Time flies!

44
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:04,866
Thank you very much for everything.

45
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,866
I remember the first time we met very well.
Shrimp pilaf.

46
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:12,066
I was so surprised about that!

47
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:16,400
I'm sorry about that.
I answered like a little girl.

48
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:19,500
No, no, it was actually refreshing.

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,833
Since your comments were so interesting,
I just used them the way they were.

50
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:23,966
- What's wrong?
- But readers seemed to

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,366
- Nothing.
- like them very much.

52
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:32,866
I'm sorry, it was her first job,
so she was quite nervous.

53
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,800
Yes, that's right.

54
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:37,800
Huh?

55
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:53,433
M-Mr. Takeda, are you okay?

56
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:56,466
Don't worry!
I just made him fall asleep.

57
00:04:56,666 --> 00:05:01,733
I-I see. But why did Full Moon
transform back into Mitsuki?

58
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:02,900
Takuto?

59
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,200
Sorry, sorry.

60
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,833
Hey! Come on!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

61
00:05:15,366 --> 00:05:16,466
What's wrong?

62
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,333
Well...

63
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,100
Hurry, Takuto!

64
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:23,466
I know! Go!

65
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:39,766
Oops! I'm sorry I fell asleep!
I must be exhausted.

66
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:42,166
P-Please don't worry!

67
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:48,600
Huh? Since when was
this stuffed animal here?

68
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:53,033
What are you talking about, Mr. Takeda?
It's been there since we got here!

69
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:53,733
Really?!

70
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:55,566
Y-Yes, it's my favorite
stuffed animal.

71
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:57,700
I bring it with me everywhere I go.

72
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Oh, I see.

73
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,066
- Yes, that's right!
- That's right!

74
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,166
Oh, Mr. Takeda!

75
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,666
Takuto...
I hope he's okay.

76
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,566
Yeah.

77
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
What?

78
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:24,733
I'm not putting on a show!

79
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,133
I-I'm sorry!

80
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:33,433
Don't worry about what happened today!
I was just a little tired.

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Really?

82
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:37,566
You don't believe me?

83
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:40,200
It's not that I don't believe you, but...

84
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,033
Okay, watch me!

85
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:48,333
Let this withered tree bloom!

86
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:55,600
Wow!

87
00:06:55,966 --> 00:06:57,000
See, I told you!

88
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,233
H-Hey, Takuto.

89
00:07:18,066 --> 00:07:19,433
Don't' say anything!

90
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:27,733
Takuto!

91
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:32,133
Takuto, are you okay? Takuto!

92
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,100
I-I'm okay.

93
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:36,233
No, you're not!

94
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,900
Takuto... Could it be...

95
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:50,333
<i>It's the same as before.</i>

96
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:57,833
<i>I thought you had stopped turning</i>
<i>into a ghost, but were we wrong?</i>

97
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:03,666
It's my fault.
It's my fault!

98
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,666
No, it's not!

99
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:12,833
It has nothing to do with you.

100
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,466
This is my problem.

101
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,900
No! I don't want you
to become a ghost!

102
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:19,833
Don't cry!

103
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,700
You too, Mitsuki.

104
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:26,633
But...

105
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:29,166
Just calm down.

106
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,066
Takuto!

107
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:42,066
I guess I'm okay now.

108
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:44,766
Don't worry about me
becoming a ghost.

109
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,333
It's not like I wanted to be
a Death Spirit either.

110
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,166
Plus, I don't wanna stay
a Death Spirit forever anyways.

111
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:53,700
Takuto...

112
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:56,600
More importantly, the problem is
Mitsuki's transformation.

113
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,633
The reason why Mitsuki can transform
is because she's got my blood in her.

114
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:07,366
So she can transform
as long as I exist.

115
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,866
If I became a ghost...

116
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,433
In other words,
if I disappear,

117
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:20,566
Mitsuki will never be able to
transform into Full Moon ever again.

118
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,500
Shoot! All this with the important
concert coming up!

119
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,466
The concert is not
the problem for you!

120
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,266
That's right!
We can't let you become a ghost!

121
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,300
Yes. Let's—

122
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,333
Just listen to me!

123
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Please listen to me.

124
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:45,166
I may not be perfect as either
a human or a Death Spirit,

125
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,000
but I always try to
keep a promise.

126
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,066
Do you remember our promise?

127
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:51,900
Our promise?

128
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,533
<i>I guess there's</i>
<i>no way around it.</i>

129
00:09:57,433 --> 00:10:01,833
<i>Go as far as you can with it.</i>
<i>I'll help you with your dream for one year.</i>

130
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
<i>Are you sure?</i>

131
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:13,033
Yeah.

132
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:17,733
The day of your concert will be
the last day for our promise.

133
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:21,466
I will keep our promise!

134
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,200
I'll be sure to let you transform!

135
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
There shouldn't be any problem!
We've always managed, right?

136
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,366
Am I wrong?

137
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:35,933
I guess so.

138
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:38,066
You're right.

139
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:39,500
That is right.

140
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,866
Okay, we'll have to do
something about it.

141
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,866
I'll think about something
for the worst-case scenario.

142
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,566
You're thinking about
the worst-case scenario already?

143
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:51,000
And my Death Spirit power
might still be okay too.

144
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,666
Right.

145
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,433
All right, I'll do my best too!

146
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:02,666
That's good! That's the spirit!

147
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:03,800
Me too!

148
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,666
Yeah!

149
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:06,333
Let's do it!

150
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,566
What's up?

151
00:11:17,966 --> 00:11:21,066
Do you think we should tell
Ms. Oshige about this?

152
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Not tonight.

153
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,033
If the situation with my powers
is the same tomorrow morning,

154
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:28,500
we can tell her then.

155
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,366
I hope your powers
will be back to normal.

156
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:33,333
Yeah.

157
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,600
<i>Aoi, don't worry.</i>

158
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:46,500
<i>I'll complete the mission.</i>

159
00:12:39,966 --> 00:12:42,633
See, I told you that I'd be fine.

160
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,433
It didn't work.

161
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,333
Don't be disappointed like that.

162
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,900
It's only been a day.

163
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,500
Takuto, drink this.

164
00:13:05,366 --> 00:13:06,366
What is it?

165
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,633
It's an energy drink.

166
00:13:07,866 --> 00:13:08,533
Huh?

167
00:13:08,966 --> 00:13:11,133
What do I have to
perk myself up for?

168
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,733
Well, why don't you
go ahead and have it,

169
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:15,900
since she picked it up for you.

170
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:17,233
Oh fine.

171
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:24,233
Do these really work?

172
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,900
H-How was it?

173
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,533
It seems like it's
not working for him.

174
00:13:39,566 --> 00:13:40,233
Yeah.

175
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,766
I know!

176
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:48,900
Yes! What do you think?

177
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,233
You think I can become Full Moon
with some make-up?

178
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,133
I should call Ms. Oshige after all,
and ask her to cancel the photo shoot.

179
00:14:03,733 --> 00:14:04,733
I got an idea!

180
00:14:11,366 --> 00:14:14,866
Good, good! That's good!
Keep doing that!

181
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:18,600
Meroko is doing a pretty good job!

182
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:23,033
I was worried because things don't go well
when she's enthusiastic about something,

183
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:25,100
but I guess she knows you well.

184
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,433
Full Moon, bring your face
up right there.

185
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:29,500
Yes.

186
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,166
Stare into the distance.

187
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,666
Yeah, good.
That's right.

188
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:41,566
<i>Who is Full Moon?</i>

189
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,466
<i>It's me, but it's not me.</i>

190
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,066
<i>Before I became Full Moon,</i>

191
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,000
<i>I was a girl who didn't have any friends</i>
<i>and dreamed of becoming a singer.</i>

192
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:38,633
<i>I made friends.</i>

193
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:42,800
<i>A lot of friends!</i>

194
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:49,200
<i>It's all thanks to Full Moon.</i>

195
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,800
W-What?
What's wrong, Mitsuki?

196
00:15:58,033 --> 00:16:03,666
I truly thank you, Takuto.
That you let me transform into Full Moon.

197
00:16:03,966 --> 00:16:04,633
What?

198
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:09,800
You've let me experience many things
that Mitsuki Koyama could never have.

199
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,033
Thank you very much.

200
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:15,366
What's up with you
all of the sudden?

201
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:21,666
I don't know. I just wanted to thank you.
Thank you so much.

202
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,700
Are you okay, Mitsuki?

203
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,200
I'm...fine.

204
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:34,133
Are you sure?
But just in case...

205
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,933
It's not getting worse
so you should be okay.

206
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,333
Great!

207
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,666
Thank you very much.

208
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,633
Umm... About Takuto...

209
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:52,766
Yeah, about that.
He has to take it easy and rest.

210
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,566
I'm fine. I know about myself
more than anyone else.

211
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,700
Meroko, please take care of Takuto.

212
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:01,433
Uh-oh!

213
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,266
Yes!

214
00:17:02,966 --> 00:17:07,166
If he tries to do something rash,
please stop him no matter what.

215
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,733
Sure, I will.

216
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
Meroko...

217
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,833
I'll take care of Takuto,
so you go to bed, Mitsuki.

218
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:33,533
But...

219
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,033
Don't make me
take care of you as well.

220
00:17:36,566 --> 00:17:37,566
Y-Yeah.

221
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:04,833
<i>I shouldn't be crying.</i>
<i>This is no time to cry.</i>

222
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,033
<i>I can't cry.</i>

223
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,933
Takuto, hang in there.

224
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:43,666
<i>Meroko and Takuto are</i>
<i>doing the best they can do.</i>

225
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,166
<i>Isn't there anything that I can do?</i>

226
00:18:50,266 --> 00:18:53,366
Wow, I found something good!

227
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:55,933
I will show it to Izumi.

228
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:03,833
<i>Those two might know</i>
<i>how to help Takuto.</i>

229
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:12,400
Izumi!

230
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,566
Hey, hey, Izumi, look at this.

231
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:18,166
Does it look good on me?

232
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,533
You're so annoying.

233
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:27,833
Izumi, are you still thinking about
that middle-aged woman by any chance?

234
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,033
It's none of your business,
Jonathan.

235
00:19:30,566 --> 00:19:35,600
She probably doesn't like you anymore.
Oh, poor thing, Izumi! Poor thing!

236
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,633
- Shut up.
- Poor thing, poor thing, poor thing!

237
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,166
In English, that would be...

238
00:19:40,566 --> 00:19:42,733
Oh, we have a guest!

239
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,566
A stranger's here,
a stranger's here.

240
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:51,533
Oh my, you came all the way here
to visit me, Mikki?

241
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,333
I want you to tell me if you know.

242
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:15,366
Do you know how to prevent
Takuto from turning into a ghost?

243
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,333
Yes, I do.

244
00:20:18,966 --> 00:20:19,966
Really?

245
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:24,466
Please tell me! Please!

246
00:20:25,366 --> 00:20:29,533
I can tell you, but...
Can I give you one condition?

247
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:33,500
Y-Yes.

248
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,333
Your soul.

249
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,200
Can I take your soul?

250
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,166
What?

251
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:45,100
So what's it gonna be, Mikki?

252
00:20:46,233 --> 00:20:51,566
<i>I don't wanna die because I finally</i>
<i>feel like I have to live...that I want to live.</i>

253
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,100
<i>But...</i>

254
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:59,133
<i>I don't wanna lose Takuto</i>
<i>after I lost Eichi!</i>

255
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:07,433
<i>Takuto... He'd get get mad at me.</i>
<i>But I don't ever wanna feel that way!</i>

256
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:11,233
Okay, as long as
we can save Takuto!

257
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,066
Well then...

258
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:37,233
Well, to seal our contract, Mikki,
I will have you kiss me.

259
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:21,166
Mitsuki, you're being rash!

260
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:25,400
I know you want to save Takuto,
but you shouldn't have gone to Izumi!

261
00:23:25,433 --> 00:23:28,200
No, it's what I needed
to do to save Takuto.

262
00:23:28,233 --> 00:23:29,566
I don't care what happens to me.

263
00:23:29,966 --> 00:23:30,966
Mitsuki...

264
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,000
Gosh, Takuto, pull yourself together!
I won't accept you disappearing!

265
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:43,033
Next time on Full Moon:
"Mitsuki's Feelings, Meroko's Feelings."

266
00:23:43,766 --> 00:23:44,766
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
