1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,766
I wish I never found out
about love.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,733
I love you.
My tears won't stop.

3
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,833
<i>Everyone is supporting me.</i>

4
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:23,033
- If this is how it's going to be,
<i>- Everyone is making me shine.</i>

5
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:26,800
- I wish I had
<i>- So I'll continue to sing.</i>

6
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:30,600
- never met you.
<i>- Just like the moon that waxes</i>

7
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:32,566
<i>and shines even</i>
<i>after it wanes.</i>

8
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
Good morning, Eichi.

9
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,833
Please watch over me from
up in the sky again today!

10
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:32,533
Takuto! Meroko!

11
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,766
Good morning!

12
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,666
Hi!

13
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,366
Good morning!

14
00:02:35,466 --> 00:02:36,766
Hey, you!

15
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,766
At least wear a pair of socks
when it's this cold!

16
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,666
Do you want to be hospitalized
again or something?

17
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:43,666
Okay!

18
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:50,500
Mitsuki! Breakfast!

19
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:51,533
Okay!

20
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:11,733
Mitsuki...

21
00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:12,433
Yes?

22
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:16,666
Well...
How is school?

23
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:22,200
We've recently started
practicing for graduation.

24
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,633
I see.

25
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:26,833
<i>Ma'am...</i>

26
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,600
What do you think
about them?

27
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:32,433
Seems to me they aren't
quite meshing right.

28
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:33,300
Yeah.

29
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,266
W-Well, I guess it'll
still take some time.

30
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,566
What do you mean
"ah ha ha"?

31
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:50,700
Is it still bothering you?

32
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,233
W-What are
you talking about?

33
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,866
I'm not bothered by
anything in the least!

34
00:04:05,933 --> 00:04:11,033
Hey, I've told you numerous times
that I don't think you're at fault.

35
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:12,200
But...

36
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,300
No "buts"!

37
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:17,233
I told you before, the whole thing
is Izumi's fault, right?!

38
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,866
Yeah.

39
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:22,166
Gimme a break. How long are
you gonna mope like that?

40
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Don't make me
worry anymore.

41
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,133
Takuto! Thank you!

42
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,700
Idiot! Stop that!

43
00:04:44,933 --> 00:04:45,933
Mitsuki...

44
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:47,533
Yes?

45
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,066
Umm... About your room...

46
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:52,200
Yes?

47
00:04:53,766 --> 00:04:56,666
W-Why don't you move
into the main house?

48
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,666
Huh?

49
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,700
<i>Ma'am!</i>

50
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,633
It's inconvenient where
you are now, isn't it?

51
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,966
And we have to think
about your health.

52
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:09,200
Grandma...

53
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:12,866
Please move into
the main house.

54
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:15,700
Okay!

55
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,566
Yay!

56
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:22,633
Good morning!

57
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,666
Thank you for helping out
every morning.

58
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
No problem.

59
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,533
Grandma, Ms. Tanaka,
I'll see you later.

60
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:32,200
Take care.

61
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:35,300
Thank you for helping
Mitsuki again today.

62
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:37,600
Sure thing!
Well, shall we go.

63
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:38,633
Okay!

64
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:41,433
See you later!

65
00:05:41,566 --> 00:05:43,433
Have a good day!

66
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:51,233
Come, Ma'am.
It's cold out here, so let's go inside.

67
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,566
Yes.

68
00:05:55,366 --> 00:05:56,566
Huh? Work?

69
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:57,600
Yeah.

70
00:05:57,866 --> 00:06:02,066
Given what happened,
and considering your health,

71
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,033
I told the office to turn down
work whenever possible.

72
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,700
But just today...

73
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,366
It's no problem at all, Ms. Oshige!

74
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,566
This is my first job since my recovery!
I'll do my best!

75
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:20,566
<i>Thank you, Mitsuki.</i>

76
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:28,300
See you later!

77
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:30,466
I'll come pick you up later!

78
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:31,633
Okay!

79
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:53,833
So, greetings from
the honored guests finish here

80
00:06:53,866 --> 00:06:56,300
and then the diplomas
will be handed out.

81
00:06:57,366 --> 00:06:59,166
- Did you watch Yaba last night?
- We'll start with the boys from Class 1

82
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,600
- Yeah, yeah!
- lining up by the stairs

83
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:02,300
- It was really funny!
- and then three people will

84
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,400
- Did you see it, Mitsuki?
- come up on stage at a time.

85
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:04,300
Yeah.

86
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,600
Hey! You!
Stop the chitchat!

87
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:08,366
Oops.

88
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:18,800
Takuto...

89
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:19,700
Please!

90
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,666
Okay.

91
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,466
All right, shall we go?

92
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,466
Okay!

93
00:07:59,766 --> 00:08:00,933
Good morning!

94
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:02,533
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

95
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,333
Dr. Wakaoji...

96
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,566
Hi!

97
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,633
What are you doing here?

98
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:13,033
I heard you were working
again starting today.

99
00:08:13,466 --> 00:08:17,266
I asked Keichi to be here
in case of emergency.

100
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:18,966
It's not only that.

101
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,900
I wanted to hear you
sing in person, Mitsuki.

102
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:25,066
If you don't feel well,
let me know immediately.

103
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:26,500
Yes!

104
00:08:35,566 --> 00:08:43,866
<i>How long has it been</i>
<i>since I fell in love with you?</i>

105
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:52,933
<i>My feelings keep</i>
<i>getting stronger.</i>

106
00:08:53,433 --> 00:09:02,033
<i>They're silent like the snow.</i>

107
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:06,700
<i>What did you say?</i>

108
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,666
<i>U-Unbelievable.</i>
<i>No way.</i>

109
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:16,433
<i>Are you...</i>
<i>Are you really...</i>

110
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:18,866
<i>Yes, I'm Takuto Kira.</i>

111
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,833
<i>That's a lie.</i>
<i>I don't believe you!</i>

112
00:09:22,433 --> 00:09:25,133
<i>I can't believe...</i>
<i>I can't believe that Takuto died!</i>

113
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:26,866
<i>Keichi...</i>

114
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,966
<i>But how do you explain</i>
<i>the way you look?</i>

115
00:09:30,366 --> 00:09:31,366
<i>What about your voice?!</i>

116
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:35,100
<i>The Takuto I know is</i>
<i>a totally different person!</i>

117
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,466
<i>First of all, why wasn't I</i>
<i>aware of it before now?</i>

118
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:46,966
<i>I see.</i>

119
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,800
<i>So that's what happened to you</i>
<i>after Route L broke up.</i>

120
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,133
<i>Yeah.</i>

121
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:56,300
<i>I apologize for getting</i>
<i>all worked up like that earlier.</i>

122
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,366
<i>It's okay.</i>

123
00:09:57,933 --> 00:10:00,633
<i>But it still doesn't</i>
<i>sit right with me.</i>

124
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,766
<i>But I've explained</i>
<i>everything to you!</i>

125
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,500
<i>No, it's not that.</i>

126
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:08,233
<i>It doesn't sit right because we were</i>
<i>such close friends back then.</i>

127
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:09,100
<i>Huh?</i>

128
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:14,466
<i>Why... Why are you a Death Spirit</i>
<i>who is trying to take Mitsuki's life?</i>

129
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:18,000
<i>It can't be helped.</i>

130
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,566
<i>I don't want to do this either. But...</i>

131
00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:31,966
<i>If the snow falls forever,</i>

132
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,166
<i>will I be able to let go</i>
<i>of these thoughts of you?</i>

133
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,000
Hey.

134
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:38,633
About what we were speaking
about the other day...

135
00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:39,933
Yeah?

136
00:10:41,066 --> 00:10:43,433
Sorry to tell you this,
Death Spirit,

137
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:45,833
but I have no intention
of letting Mitsuki die.

138
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:50,266
If the cause of Mitsuki's death
is her throat illness,

139
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,633
I, as her doctor,
will root it out.

140
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:54,466
That is my mission.

141
00:10:55,866 --> 00:10:58,833
It is true that I am a Death Spirit.
But...

142
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:02,866
I don't have any intention
of letting that girl die.

143
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:04,333
Takuto.

144
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,100
Our objectives are the same.

145
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:13,166
<i>I want to scream in</i>
<i>the winter sky</i>

146
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,266
I look forward to
working with you!

147
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:23,566
<i>that I want to</i>
<i>see you right now.</i>

148
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,966
Wow, it was so much fun
to work after such a long time!

149
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,133
You're not overdoing it, are you?
Are you feeling all right?

150
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,366
I'm totally fine.

151
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,000
I see. That's a relief.

152
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:02,600
Ms. Oshige!
Please stop right here!

153
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:10,933
What? I don't need to
drop you off at home?

154
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:12,133
No.

155
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,333
Well then, Ms. Oshige,
thank you very much!

156
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:17,866
You're welcome.

157
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:21,866
Everyone!

158
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,933
Oh, Mitsuki!

159
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:24,366
Good evening!

160
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:26,533
Did you just get back
from your check-up?

161
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,333
Well then, please take
good care of Mitsuki.

162
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:30,700
- Yeah.
- Okay.

163
00:12:35,966 --> 00:12:37,400
So cool...

164
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:38,933
She's been driving you around

165
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,866
ever since you were released
from the hospital, hasn't she?

166
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,433
Wow.

167
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:46,966
But is it really okay for a racecar
to drive on ordinary streets?

168
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,566
I feel like it's really starting to
hit me that we're graduating soon.

169
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,200
But even after we graduate, we'll still
see each other at the same junior high.

170
00:12:57,466 --> 00:12:58,466
Right, Mitsuki?!

171
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:00,400
Y-Yeah!

172
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:02,933
Graduating all together, huh?

173
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,500
I hope that we'll all be
in the same class again.

174
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,233
Yeah, that would be great!

175
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:12,933
Wouldn't it?

176
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,900
You say that...

177
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:18,733
But you want to be in the same class
with Machida, don't you, Kumi?

178
00:13:18,766 --> 00:13:20,333
W-What are you
talking about?

179
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,433
Oh, you're blushing!

180
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:24,233
Stop that, Wakana!

181
00:13:24,266 --> 00:13:27,333
I'm jealous!
I want a boyfriend!

182
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:28,833
Shut it!

183
00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:30,766
I want one too!

184
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,133
- See you!
- See you!

185
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,500
Okay, see you at school!

186
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:39,633
- Bye!
- Bye!

187
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:40,666
See you tomorrow!

188
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,700
See ya!

189
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,433
I lied.

190
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:51,100
What about?

191
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:55,366
That I would be going to the same
junior high school as everyone.

192
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:57,033
Mitsuki...

193
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,233
I won't be able to go
to junior high, will I?

194
00:14:05,566 --> 00:14:06,666
But it's all right.

195
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,566
Until then, I will give my all in my singing,
and I'll live with all my might.

196
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:14,500
I'm sure Eichi would
want that too.

197
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:17,133
So that's why you're
saying it's all right?

198
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:18,100
Yeah!

199
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:20,600
So you're gonna lie
to me too?

200
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,000
Huh?

201
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,533
Please be honest with me.

202
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:26,766
I am being honest—

203
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,466
That's not true!

204
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:31,433
If you want to live,
say you want to live!

205
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,333
If you're scared,
say you're scared!

206
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:37,700
Don't lie to me.

207
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:41,500
It's natural to feel that way.

208
00:14:43,033 --> 00:14:44,833
Don't hold it all within yourself.

209
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:47,500
In that case...

210
00:14:48,866 --> 00:14:53,366
So if I were to say that,
is that gonna change something?

211
00:14:54,566 --> 00:14:58,900
That I want to live, or that I'm scared...
Is that gonna change something?

212
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:01,933
To tell the truth...

213
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:04,433
To tell the truth, I really...

214
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:14,800
It'll be all right. Don't worry.

215
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:16,566
I won't let you die.

216
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:23,366
I won't lie to you either.
I will protect you.

217
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:26,266
I won't let you die
no matter what.

218
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,400
<i>The only person who can</i>
<i>protect her now is me.</i>

219
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,566
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>This is the best way.</i>

220
00:15:57,966 --> 00:16:03,566
<i>Betraying someone you love and</i>
<i>seeking happiness just for yourself...</i>

221
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:08,000
<i>I'm the worst.</i>

222
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,166
So you finally understood?
Whatever will be, will be.

223
00:16:23,366 --> 00:16:25,633
We should be together too.

224
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:27,133
Who would want that?!

225
00:16:28,466 --> 00:16:33,233
You're very defiant, aren't you, Mero?
But this is the last chance.

226
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:37,700
Now... Come back to me.

227
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,233
You're mistaken.

228
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:51,700
What I felt as I watched
the two of them

229
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:55,800
was that loving someone is
something much more tranquil.

230
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,133
Takuto forgave me.

231
00:16:59,033 --> 00:17:03,000
He forgave the person
who betrayed him and

232
00:17:03,033 --> 00:17:06,400
was the very cause of
his possibly becoming a ghost.

233
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:12,966
And also, despite putting himself
in potentially dangerous situations,

234
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,300
he always protected that girl.

235
00:17:17,133 --> 00:17:20,866
I believe that loving someone means
having that kind of tranquil big heart.

236
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,400
What are you saying, Mero?

237
00:17:24,766 --> 00:17:31,433
In that way... In an even bigger way...
I do love Takuto after all.

238
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:38,500
Why? A guy like Takuto who can't
even do his work as a Death Spirit?

239
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:39,833
That's exactly why.

240
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,200
Because he has a much more
beautiful heart than we do.

241
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:48,900
He doesn't have to be able to do the work
of a Death Spirit who just reaps lives.

242
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:54,966
I love Takuto as a person.

243
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,800
Mero...

244
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:01,500
You probably don't
understand, do you?

245
00:18:02,633 --> 00:18:05,166
That's your misfortune, Izumi.

246
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,566
My misfortune?

247
00:18:09,866 --> 00:18:10,533
Goodbye!

248
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,333
I wonder where Meroko went.

249
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
Jeez...

250
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,366
That idiot.

251
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:47,066
Huh? Umm...

252
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,100
Meroko!

253
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:50,733
Takuto, who are you
calling an idiot?

254
00:18:50,966 --> 00:18:52,733
Jeez, where were you?

255
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,533
We were worried about you!

256
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:58,333
Both of you are really kind,
aren't you?

257
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,166
I love both of you!

258
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:08,966
M-Meroko, what's the matter,
saying things like that out of the blue?

259
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,366
Huh? Nothing!

260
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,633
Th-That hurts!
Get away from me!

261
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:19,300
Then, just Mitsuki...

262
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:21,700
That feels so warm!

263
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:26,400
Mitsuki! Dinner!

264
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,666
Okay!

265
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:35,966
Grandma?

266
00:19:36,966 --> 00:19:37,966
What is it?

267
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:43,033
Your suggestion to move
into the main house... Umm...

268
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:46,833
Could you wait
just a little longer?

269
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,066
Huh?

270
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,766
Huh?

271
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,200
Umm... It's not that I don't want to move,
and there's no deep meaning behind it!

272
00:19:52,466 --> 00:19:53,933
I guess I could say
I first need closure.

273
00:19:54,633 --> 00:19:55,733
Or how could I put it?

274
00:19:58,566 --> 00:19:59,600
Ma'am...

275
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
I see.

276
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:06,000
If it's a decision
you have made, Mitsuki.

277
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:09,133
I understand.

278
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:12,666
Grandma, thank you!

279
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,366
Don't worry about it.
I look forward to you moving in.

280
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:18,066
Ma'am...

281
00:20:18,266 --> 00:20:20,433
Come, finish up.

282
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:21,333
Okay!

283
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:25,866
<i>I'd like the three of us,</i>
<i>Takuto, Meroko and I,</i>

284
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,066
<i>to be together in that annex</i>
<i>just a little longer.</i>

285
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,366
<i>I'm sorry, Grandma.</i>

286
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:33,633
Hey, Meroko.

287
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:34,500
What?

288
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,200
You said that a keyword
hasn't appeared

289
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:39,166
since Eichi's backwards name
disappeared, right?

290
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,900
Huh? Yeah. Why?

291
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,533
Could you lend me the Death Spirit
Handbook for a moment?

292
00:20:43,966 --> 00:20:45,733
What's up all of a sudden?

293
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:49,800
Here.

294
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,066
Okay then.

295
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,333
Huh?

296
00:20:55,366 --> 00:20:56,766
TAKUTO KIRA
I am the keyword.

297
00:20:57,566 --> 00:20:59,800
W-What are you doing?!

298
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,800
Takuto! Do you understand
what this means?

299
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,200
Of course.

300
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:07,333
Then why?!

301
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,266
What the heck is fate anyway?
It's stupid.

302
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:17,033
If no one is able to change
that girl's fate, I will change it.

303
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:19,800
Takuto...

304
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:26,533
There's no way
a half-baked guy like you

305
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:28,733
could do something
like that alone!

306
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,566
Meroko! You...

307
00:21:33,266 --> 00:21:33,933
Yeah!

308
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,333
TAKUTO KIRA
MEROKO YUI
Me too.

309
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,600
What happened?

310
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:22,533
She relapsed from
her transformation all of a sudden

311
00:23:22,566 --> 00:23:24,133
back into her
12-year-old self!

312
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:26,433
My Death Spirit powers are
just a little weak right now.

313
00:23:26,466 --> 00:23:27,633
Don't worry about it.

314
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:29,566
Takuto, could that mean...

315
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,633
It's fine.
Do you not trust me?

316
00:23:32,866 --> 00:23:33,533
But...

317
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:37,400
I decided that I would help her
achieve her dream in one year.

318
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,233
I'm keeping my promise!

319
00:23:40,266 --> 00:23:43,766
Next time on Full Moon:
"I Can't Be Full Moon."

320
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,333
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
