1
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:08,033
This is Mitsuki Koyama,
12 years old.

2
00:00:08,366 --> 00:00:11,133
Last time, she had her first
television studio recording

3
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:13,566
but she just kept forgetting things
and messing things up!

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,166
She almost didn't get
to sing her song "Myself"!

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,766
But with a veteran singer's
warm words of encouragement,

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,166
everything turned out well
for Full Moon!

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,133
I may have become an expert
in the show business world!

8
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:28,266
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Got that?

10
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:35,133
Yes.

11
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:17,333
Thanks to this photo you took,

12
00:02:17,366 --> 00:02:20,366
the popularity of
the Guitar Fighters has plunged.

13
00:02:20,633 --> 00:02:21,800
I see...

14
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,333
You've made quite
a few enemies, haven't you?

15
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:28,500
One of these days,
they'll come to haunt you.

16
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,033
If I was scared of some
stupid ghosts,

17
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:33,066
I wouldn't be able to be
in this line of work.

18
00:02:33,466 --> 00:02:36,366
So? What do you
need from me, Chief?

19
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,333
I want new material.

20
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:43,733
Weekly tabloid magazines don't sell
without a good scoop.

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,666
Then, how about this girl?

22
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,800
Your next target?

23
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:50,400
Full Moon...

24
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,366
She's a 16-year-old idol
who's been popular lately.

25
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:55,266
However, there's no data on her.

26
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,266
Not even her real name
has been made public.

27
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,800
I see. Full Moon, huh?

28
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:05,233
And now,

29
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:09,300
Next from "Fullta Moontaro,"
we have a question.

30
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:13,000
"Miss Full Moon, what kind of artist do
you want to become in the future?"

31
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:17,666
How about it?
Do you have some kind of goal?

32
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:19,433
Oh, umm...

33
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:25,066
Umm...From here on,
I want to keep singing,

34
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,300
and send out my feelings.

35
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,766
Send out your feelings.
So is there someone specific?

36
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,533
What?!

37
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:35,433
Uh, well...

38
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:38,300
It's a secret.

39
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,966
A secret?

40
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,966
Come to think of it,
your real name's also...

41
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:45,900
Oh, yes.
That's also a secret.

42
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:47,966
Hmm... I see.

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,800
Everything's a secret, huh?

44
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:50,500
Yes.

45
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,466
Tomorrow's the magazine
cover photo shoot, right?

46
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,266
You'll be with Shirakawa
from Shonen Drill.

47
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,100
Whoa, really?

48
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,400
That's right.

49
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:10,766
It's your first collaborative photo...

50
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:12,166
Huh?

51
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,866
We're going to take
a little detour!

52
00:04:28,566 --> 00:04:30,666
Miss Oshige, is something wrong?

53
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,233
We're being tailed.

54
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:33,766
Huh? Tailed?

55
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,933
Don't look!
You'll get your picture taken...

56
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:40,100
by Saegusa,
a tabloid photographer .

57
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,866
He's this jerk who specializes
in exposing

58
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,866
details of celebrities' private lives
and their romances.

59
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:51,933
We've been followed from the studio.

60
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:57,133
I bet he was taking your pictures
the whole time you were on the air.

61
00:04:57,266 --> 00:04:58,000
Huh?!

62
00:04:58,233 --> 00:04:59,533
Darn it.

63
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,233
Miss Oshige...

64
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,666
Late!

65
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,933
They're late!

66
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,900
What're those two doing?
Hm?!

67
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,266
What's this?

68
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:25,700
Lens?

69
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:32,000
He's really persistent!

70
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:34,500
At this rate, I won't be
able to drop you off.

71
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:36,933
I'm kind of scared.

72
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,266
All right!

73
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:52,333
Damn!

74
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:55,466
We lost him, huh.

75
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,033
Saegusa is like a hyena.

76
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,766
He doesn't let the prey
he targets escape, no matter what.

77
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:03,000
There isn't an entertainer
who has completely escaped

78
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,500
after being targeted by him.

79
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,766
But, I don't have anything
to be targeted.

80
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:12,000
You haven't had your real name
and profile made public, right?

81
00:06:13,066 --> 00:06:16,500
For a person like him,
you're an object of extreme interest.

82
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,566
No way.

83
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,833
It'll be okay.
If something happens,

84
00:06:19,866 --> 00:06:22,466
the management office and I
will protect you with all our strength.

85
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:24,433
You're not alone.

86
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:25,900
Okay.

87
00:06:31,466 --> 00:06:32,766
Have a good evening.

88
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:34,166
Oh! Mitsuki.

89
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:34,966
Yes?

90
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,400
Maybe I should take you home.

91
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,533
No, I'm okay.

92
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Really?

93
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:43,366
If something out of the
ordinary happens,

94
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,866
contact me right away, okay?

95
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,233
If my real name is found out,
I might not be able to sing.

96
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:52,800
I won't let that happen,
no matter what.

97
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,266
Hey, don't turn around,
no matter what.

98
00:06:58,366 --> 00:07:00,133
Huh? What is it?!

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,833
We're being followed.

100
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:04,500
Wh-Why?

101
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,066
We weren't able to
get away completely.

102
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,033
Oh no!
What should I do?

103
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:12,033
Just walk normally as is.
Turn around that corner.

104
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,200
Okay...

105
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:30,666
This is bad.

106
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,533
This means I won't be able to
turn you back to normal.

107
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,666
No way...

108
00:07:41,366 --> 00:07:42,400
What shall I do?

109
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:47,833
Hey, over there!

110
00:07:47,866 --> 00:07:49,233
Go into that tunnel!

111
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,833
Got it...

112
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:03,266
Good! It's okay, now.
Let's go.

113
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:09,900
It's that guy...

114
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,833
I told you it'd be okay, right?

115
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:37,033
Yeah... But I was scared.

116
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:39,700
No kidding.

117
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,000
You had a rough time, huh?

118
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:45,733
But thanks to Takuto being there,
I was able to get away completely.

119
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,900
Don't mention it.

120
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,000
Well, I have an early start
tomorrow,

121
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:50,900
so I'm going to take a bath.

122
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,733
Hey, Takuto.

123
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,633
Yeah?

124
00:08:55,766 --> 00:08:56,533
Huh?

125
00:08:57,933 --> 00:08:59,233
What is it, Meroko?

126
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:01,900
It was difficult to say
in front of that girl.

127
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:04,133
A new job has come up.

128
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,400
Something preventing
her death, again?

129
00:09:06,866 --> 00:09:08,600
Hm?! What's this?

130
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,400
The letters are backwards.

131
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,400
It's backwards,

132
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:14,233
so that means the pattern is
the opposite of the usual.

133
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,066
In other words, it doesn't mean
something will delay her death,

134
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,966
but hasten it.

135
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:22,900
Hasten her death, you say?!

136
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,966
It says, "Lens."

137
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:26,933
Lens?!

138
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:31,300
Saegusa's camera?

139
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:35,466
We should stop her from
going to work tomorrow.

140
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:37,033
What're you saying?

141
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:38,700
I can stop that guy on my own.

142
00:09:38,733 --> 00:09:39,766
Impossible.

143
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,100
That'd be absolutely impossible
for a rookie like you!

144
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,366
Then, what're you saying we do?

145
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:49,066
I'll do something about it.

146
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:57,133
Is that really okay?

147
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:59,800
But, this is all there is
for us to do.

148
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,300
Let's see, this and this.

149
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,000
I have this, too...

150
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:05,400
All right.

151
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,133
It's just a dream.

152
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:15,100
It's not a dream!
What're you doing, Meroko?!

153
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:18,366
Oh, uh, well...

154
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:22,533
I thought I'd try turning into
Full Moon and go out today.

155
00:10:22,566 --> 00:10:23,200
Why?

156
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:28,266
Um...I-I wanted to let you
relax for once.

157
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,933
Work's rough, isn't it?

158
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,833
That's not a problem.
I like work.

159
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,333
Sorry, but I have work, too.

160
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:37,400
Hmm? What do you mean by work?

161
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,333
No, it's all right, Meroko.

162
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,466
Takuto?

163
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,766
You just stay here.

164
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:44,833
But...

165
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:48,100
It's okay. I'll protect her,
no matter what!

166
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:57,733
What was up with Meroko?

167
00:10:57,766 --> 00:10:58,866
It's nothing.

168
00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:01,466
Now, let's hurry!

169
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:02,366
Yeah.

170
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,733
<i>No matter what happens...</i>

171
00:11:09,766 --> 00:11:11,566
<i>I'll protect you.</i>

172
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,800
Okay, it's a wrap!

173
00:11:33,066 --> 00:11:34,400
Thank you very much.

174
00:11:34,433 --> 00:11:37,333
What?! That Saegusa has
his eye on her?

175
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:39,766
That's right. What a pain...

176
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,366
We've also had
bad experiences with him.

177
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:45,300
We had people quit
on account of him.

178
00:11:45,466 --> 00:11:47,900
Yes... It's a real problem, isn't it?

179
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:48,900
Miss Oshige!

180
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:52,400
The shoot is done.

181
00:11:52,566 --> 00:11:55,666
I-I see.
That's it for today.

182
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:58,400
All right. Then I'm going home.

183
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,366
Oh, shall I take you?

184
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:02,500
No, it's okay.

185
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,500
I see... Be careful
going home, okay?

186
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,833
Okay! I'm sorry to be
leaving so early.

187
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,933
Miss Oshige's such worrier, isn't she?

188
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:19,200
Yeah. But actually, that Saegusa jerk
hasn't come since then.

189
00:12:19,233 --> 00:12:20,000
Excuse me.

190
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:25,133
You're Miss Full Moon, right?

191
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:28,566
Could you take
a picture with us?

192
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,933
Uh, sure.

193
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:32,566
Yay!

194
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,066
Get a nice shot.

195
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,500
Get a bit closer.

196
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:37,000
Okay! I'm going to take
the picture.

197
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,533
Say cheese.

198
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:42,333
Please do your best.
We'll be cheering you on.

199
00:12:42,433 --> 00:12:44,033
Oh, thanks.

200
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:48,466
Geez, making me panic like that.

201
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,366
I was scared.
I thought it was Saegusa again...

202
00:12:56,766 --> 00:12:57,633
It's him!

203
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,066
Let's go!

204
00:12:59,133 --> 00:13:00,066
Y-Yeah.

205
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:07,433
Damn.

206
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,533
<i>I won't be able to sing if
my secret is known.</i>

207
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:14,033
<i>And I won't...with Eichi...</i>

208
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,733
<i>Impossible.</i>

209
00:13:17,766 --> 00:13:20,966
<i>That'd be absolutely impossible
for a rookie like you!</i>

210
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,766
<i>That just can't be true.</i>

211
00:13:24,966 --> 00:13:26,500
Hey!
What're you?!

212
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:27,600
But...

213
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:32,766
He's going to catch up.

214
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:38,466
Okay! Let's go!

215
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,133
Huh? H-Hey!

216
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:44,400
We have to change you back to
a 12-year-old while we have the chance!

217
00:13:44,433 --> 00:13:45,433
O-Okay.

218
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:49,666
SUMMER SALE
GOING ON NOW!

219
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:55,766
Hide over there.

220
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:56,900
But...

221
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,633
Quickly!

222
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,166
While we're at it,
wear this just in case!

223
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:20,500
- Now!
- Okay!

224
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:23,066
Yes, it's right on target...

225
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,666
I understand. Bye...

226
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:38,266
Has he noticed you?

227
00:14:39,133 --> 00:14:40,400
Run away while you can.

228
00:14:50,433 --> 00:14:51,700
It can't be!

229
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,733
Oww!

230
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,533
What're you doing?

231
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,500
I'm sorry...

232
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:00,466
My, I'm sorry.

233
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,933
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

234
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:04,300
Oh, I'm okay.

235
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:05,900
I'm sorry.

236
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:07,633
Huh?

237
00:15:08,766 --> 00:15:10,500
That girl.

238
00:15:14,066 --> 00:15:14,933
Oh no!

239
00:15:19,566 --> 00:15:22,000
You jerk! Take this!

240
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,966
What the—?!

241
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:28,933
And this!

242
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:31,166
W-What?!

243
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,666
Go while you can.

244
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:38,966
Okay!

245
00:15:39,766 --> 00:15:41,366
Okay, I'll go at it like crazy!

246
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:49,233
Here's a bonus!

247
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,566
W-What's going on?

248
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,000
What's that?

249
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,133
What? Is it
a supernatural phenomenon?!

250
00:15:59,266 --> 00:16:00,566
It's a poltergeist!

251
00:16:00,866 --> 00:16:01,900
Oh no, how scary...

252
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:03,266
He's a groper! A pervert!

253
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:06,333
No, you've got it wrong.
It's not me!

254
00:16:09,966 --> 00:16:12,033
Where'd she go?

255
00:16:14,366 --> 00:16:15,400
Oh my...

256
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,566
Which way was the station?

257
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,433
Damn it. That was horrible...

258
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,433
She slipped through my fingers.

259
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,500
It's not like me.

260
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,766
There she is.

261
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:41,033
Takuto couldn't possibly...

262
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,500
I wonder if he's okay.

263
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,300
Where am I?

264
00:16:52,033 --> 00:16:54,433
What should I do?
And Takuto isn't here...

265
00:16:55,266 --> 00:16:56,666
I know! The whistle!

266
00:16:59,633 --> 00:17:00,566
You!

267
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,000
Mitsuki!

268
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,500
Mitsuki!

269
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:06,833
<i>Where is she?</i>

270
00:17:08,266 --> 00:17:11,233
I saw you yesterday, right?
In the tunnel.

271
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:15,466
As a matter of fact, an idol named
Full Moon went through there then.

272
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:16,766
Did you notice her?

273
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:23,533
Strange. You're the only person
I saw down there.

274
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:25,266
I-I don't know.

275
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,100
Then why do you run away?

276
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:32,900
Could it be that you're
affiliated with Full Moon?

277
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:36,500
You can't answer?

278
00:17:36,633 --> 00:17:38,333
I-It's nothing like that...

279
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,800
Then, could you please
talk to me a bit?

280
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,166
No!

281
00:17:52,266 --> 00:17:53,133
H-Hey!

282
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,500
<i>No. I won't be able to see Eichi
ever again if my picture is taken!</i>

283
00:17:58,533 --> 00:17:59,833
You little brat.

284
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:12,366
<i>Hurry... Hurry...</i>

285
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,166
I've been waiting for you!

286
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,833
Say, could you give back
my camera?

287
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,300
Fine. I won't ask you
anything anymore. Okay?

288
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,933
Now, that's enough!

289
00:19:03,566 --> 00:19:04,400
H-Hey!

290
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:06,166
It's dangerous for you
to be out there!

291
00:19:07,966 --> 00:19:09,800
Hey! Come back here!

292
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:17,200
<i>Takuto, help me...</i>

293
00:19:21,966 --> 00:19:23,666
<i>Takuto!</i>

294
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:31,933
Man, making me worry...

295
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,133
That jerk...

296
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,866
W-What? She's floating.

297
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,100
Yikes!

298
00:19:57,133 --> 00:19:58,600
What in the world
are you?

299
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:03,433
I'm the vengeful ghost of
a celebrity you ruined.

300
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:05,533
V-Vengeful ghost?

301
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:11,000
That's right.
I've come to settle the score.

302
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,000
W-What're you going to do?!

303
00:20:14,966 --> 00:20:19,333
I won't be satisfied until you have
a taste of your own medicine.

304
00:20:22,066 --> 00:20:23,233
Stop it...

305
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:26,833
Please! I'll do anything
if you forgive me.

306
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,433
I beg you!

307
00:20:28,466 --> 00:20:31,300
Then, you must vow never
to do a thing like this again.

308
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,666
Otherwise, I'll haunt you for
the rest of your life.

309
00:20:35,366 --> 00:20:39,233
Okay. I understand!
I'll never do it again.

310
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:40,933
Then, get out of here!

311
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:45,733
Well, that's that.

312
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,100
You did well.

313
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:56,066
Hm?! It's vanishing.

314
00:20:57,766 --> 00:20:59,400
You did it, Takuto!

315
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:08,333
And now! Continuing from last week,
Miss Full Moon has joined us again.

316
00:21:08,966 --> 00:21:10,333
I'm glad to be here.

317
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,166
By the way, Miss Full Moon.

318
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:13,066
Yes?

319
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,266
Could you please tell us at least
one of the things you've kept secret?

320
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,066
Secrets are meant to be kept secret.

321
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:21,700
You're just one big secret right,
Miss Full Moon?

322
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:22,833
Right!

323
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:26,200
Then, shall we go with the song?

324
00:21:26,366 --> 00:21:28,433
Here's Miss Full Moon with "Myself."

325
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:34,133
<i>Why do I like you so much...</i>

326
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,600
You don't need to worry
about Saegusa anymore.

327
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,833
I don't know what happened,

328
00:21:38,866 --> 00:21:42,500
but it seems he suddenly quit
his cameraman job and went back home.

329
00:21:42,966 --> 00:21:43,933
Really?

330
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,100
I wonder if the medicine
worked too well!

331
00:21:47,566 --> 00:21:48,500
Maybe!

332
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,466
Oww! Hey, what's the meaning of this?

333
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,066
I can't get into Mitsuki's house!

334
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:26,300
Hold on. Let me check on this.

335
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:30,000
What?! A barrier caused by
the Saint's Stone?

336
00:23:30,266 --> 00:23:31,000
What's that?

337
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:34,833
Anyway, it's some kind of barrier
that WE can't pass through!

338
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,000
This is bad. We have to get back
and transform her.

339
00:23:38,866 --> 00:23:43,266
Next time on Full Moon:
"Green Onion Ramen and the Saint's Stone."

340
00:23:43,566 --> 00:23:44,600
- Don't miss it!
- Don't miss it!
