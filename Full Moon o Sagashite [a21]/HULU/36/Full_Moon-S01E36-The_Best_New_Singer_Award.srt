1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,933
One day, an email comes
from Eichi in America!

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,233
The unexpected good news
brightens Mitsuki's spirits

3
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:14,466
and even helps her condition improve!

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,466
But then we find out that the email
was actually a fake, sent from Izumi!

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,766
Takuto! How do we tell Mitsuki the truth?

6
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,833
So, I wonder what's
going to happen today...

7
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:33,566
Got that?

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,800
Yes.

9
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:18,433
<i>Eichi... The minute that</i>
<i>email from you came,</i>

10
00:02:18,466 --> 00:02:20,733
<i>I got word of a new operation.</i>

11
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:25,166
<i>It's like you brought me happiness!</i>

12
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:30,233
Takuto...

13
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:34,833
What are we going to do?
About Eichi's email being a fake.

14
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:36,033
Should we tell her?

15
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,500
Yes, Ms. Oshige?

16
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:44,033
Yes...

17
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:45,833
What?

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,166
I've been nominated for
the Best New Singer Award

19
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
in the Fantasia Music Festival?!

20
00:02:58,766 --> 00:03:00,766
Is it really that amazing of an award?

21
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:03,666
It's not just amazing.

22
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:06,233
It's the only international music festival

23
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:10,266
for which Japan is in association
with America's AAS Broadcasting.

24
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,366
Wow.

25
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:14,600
In addition, what's unique
about this festival is that

26
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:16,866
the audience gets to vote
alongside the judges.

27
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:19,866
That's why your performance
on that day is important

28
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,466
in order to get a lot of votes
from the audience.

29
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:24,866
We have to improve your
condition from now on.

30
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,300
I can't really grasp it all quite yet.

31
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:32,266
But what I'm about to tell
you will really get you motivated!

32
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,766
You see, the winner of
the Best New Singer Award

33
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,333
will be invited to America.

34
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,433
What?!

35
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,733
America?

36
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,966
America... I'll get to see Eichi.

37
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,266
You have to win! Right?

38
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,233
It's a really big music festival.

39
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,300
Hey! You're so cute!

40
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,666
You're waiting for an email
from Eichi, aren't you?

41
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:07,566
N-No! That's not it.

42
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:10,100
It's just that if I hold my cell phone,

43
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:13,800
I feel like I'm connected to Eichi,
and it calms me down.

44
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:16,233
Aww, I'm jealous!

45
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:17,700
Stop it, Ms. Oshige!

46
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,333
Full Moon, we'll start the explanation!

47
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:23,266
Oh, okay! Ms. Oshige,
please hold these for me.

48
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:24,100
Okay.

49
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:30,400
She's been so happy since
she got the email from Eichi.

50
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:33,566
Yes. On top of that, there's the news
of the new treatment method,

51
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,066
and the Best New Singer Award
nomination.

52
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:39,233
I'm sure that if she got
about 100 emails from Eichi,

53
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:41,066
her illness would be cured.

54
00:04:44,933 --> 00:04:46,066
Dr. Wakaoji!

55
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,266
Hi.

56
00:04:47,766 --> 00:04:51,066
Ms. Oshige... Umm...
Did I get any emails?

57
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:52,300
No.

58
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:54,000
I see.

59
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:58,933
Hey, they say no news is good news.

60
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:05,833
That's okay! Because I'm really happy
with that one email from Eichi.

61
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:08,566
Hey...

62
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:13,933
Don't you think we should tell her
that the email was fake after all?

63
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:14,833
No!

64
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:17,266
She's so happy!

65
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,733
It's an important time with
the Best New Singer Award.

66
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:21,600
To tell her that now...

67
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:26,266
But isn't it crueler to make her
happy with lies?

68
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:28,000
Takuto!

69
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:34,933
Full Moon, please.

70
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:35,966
Okay.

71
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:04,800
She needs an email from Eichi.

72
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:15,266
DEAR MITSUKI
I'M ALWAYS LISTENING
TO YOUR SONGS.
GOOD LUCK WITH
THE BEST
NEW SINGER AWARD.
—EICHI

73
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,666
SEND

74
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:30,700
Hey, hey! Takuto!

75
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:34,066
Do you want to see
the new email from Eichi?

76
00:07:34,266 --> 00:07:35,566
Not really.

77
00:07:35,766 --> 00:07:38,733
Don't say that!
See, see! Look!

78
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,233
It's kind of short and curt, but...

79
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:45,300
He's probably just busy, right?

80
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:47,066
I don't know.

81
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,566
<i>Yeah, because I wrote it! Darn it!</i>

82
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,666
But even though it's short,
I can feel that he's thinking about me.

83
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,200
I understand.

84
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:02,000
I feel like his true feelings are in
this short email

85
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:06,633
more than in the long one that I got first.

86
00:08:07,466 --> 00:08:08,633
I wonder why.

87
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:14,266
Hello? Is this Meroko?

88
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,666
Tomorrow, I'm going to stay at home.
So please stay with her.

89
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,833
Yeah, see ya.

90
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,933
Hey! Oshige!

91
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:38,300
Oh, Department Manager.

92
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:40,033
Who's this?

93
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,733
I'm going to make my debut soon.

94
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:45,800
I'm Yuma Shimazu.
I'm looking forward to working with you.

95
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:49,400
I guess you could say
she's Full Moon's junior.

96
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,300
I've always admired you.

97
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,133
Full Moon, I look forward to
working with you.

98
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:57,100
I look forward to working with you too.

99
00:08:57,566 --> 00:08:58,933
Thank you.

100
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:01,633
Wow, what a cute plush toy.

101
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,933
May I see it?

102
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:06,333
Y-Yeah, here.

103
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,766
Wow.

104
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:12,633
It's about time for the meeting to start.

105
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,466
Department Manager, I'll see you later.

106
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,200
Yeah.

107
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,133
<i>Don't leave me here!</i>

108
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,633
<i>An email? Could it be Eichi?</i>

109
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,666
Jeez...

110
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,333
It's not easy being in the plush toy form.

111
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,266
Ow! What the...

112
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,800
Meroko! I'm so glad I found you!

113
00:09:56,066 --> 00:09:58,966
I have to go to Narita Airport
right away!

114
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,033
I got an email from Eichi!
He's coming to Japan today!

115
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:03,633
What?

116
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,166
So please tell Takuto to come
to Narita Airport!

117
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,266
W-Wait!

118
00:10:09,366 --> 00:10:11,100
I'll be back before the show!

119
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:38,100
That Mitsuki...
I wonder where she went.

120
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:43,866
This is Oshige.

121
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,933
Oh, Mitsuki? Hey, where are you?

122
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:49,200
What?

123
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,233
What?! Eiichi is here?!

124
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,566
Yes, I'll definitely return before the show.

125
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,900
So please let me go to Narita Airport.

126
00:10:58,566 --> 00:10:59,466
<i>I understand.</i>

127
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:01,800
<i>I'll be waiting for you, Mitsuki.</i>

128
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,733
<i>Thank you, Ms. Oshige!</i>

129
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
All right!

130
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
<i>What's going on?</i>

131
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,900
I don't know! Anyway, she told me
to tell you to go to Narita.

132
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:14,433
<i>I understand. I'll go at once.</i>

133
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,666
Yay, were you surprised?

134
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:22,666
Mero, how are you?

135
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,600
Izumi...

136
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,066
Hi!

137
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:29,400
I can't believe
you were surprised by that.

138
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:30,700
Maybe you're getting old.

139
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:35,333
What do you want?
I'm busy now. Bye.

140
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,633
It looks like Mitsuki fell
for the email I sent.

141
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:43,633
Mitsuki is really innocent and cute.

142
00:11:43,766 --> 00:11:44,733
What did you say?!

143
00:11:45,566 --> 00:11:46,600
About the email?

144
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:52,100
You told me to quit it,
but Takuto's doing it himself.

145
00:11:52,766 --> 00:11:55,466
That's why I started emailing again.

146
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,800
Takuto sent...an email?

147
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,866
So I collaborated and wrote,

148
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,466
"Today I'm returning to Narita.
I'd like you to pick me up."

149
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:05,966
How could you?!

150
00:12:06,566 --> 00:12:07,733
What's this?

151
00:12:07,766 --> 00:12:11,933
Mero, aren't you happy that Mitsuki's
feelings are directed at Eichi?

152
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:14,100
I want you to thank me.

153
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:19,966
We'll start rehearsal.
Please start, Ms. Komaki.

154
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,033
Our special guest today is the winner

155
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:25,966
of last year's Best New Singer Award,
The Scanty.

156
00:12:35,966 --> 00:12:40,200
<i>I want to be a Rock n' Roll Princess!</i>

157
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:43,433
<i>And dance with the rock spirit!</i>

158
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:48,166
<i>My heart throbs... Oh Rock Star!</i>

159
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:52,433
<i>Crying out a scream of love!</i>

160
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,266
Meroko!

161
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,233
Takuto!

162
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,166
What in the world happened?

163
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,400
I'd like to ask you!

164
00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:04,100
What's this about you sending
an email to Mitsuki?!

165
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:05,266
Th-That was...

166
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,366
Izumi jumped on the bandwagon and
sent an email again because you did!

167
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,300
What?!

168
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:12,000
That Izumi...

169
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:14,766
Hey, Takuto.

170
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:19,200
I know what Izumi did was wrong,
but you sent a fake email too, right?

171
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,866
If it's false hope,
then we shouldn't make her wait!

172
00:13:24,466 --> 00:13:27,133
That will hurt her unnecessarily.

173
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:33,366
For whatever reason you did it,
it's still the same as what Izumi did.

174
00:13:34,466 --> 00:13:35,333
Sorry.

175
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,533
Oh, c'mon!

176
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,400
I have a load of things
I want to say to you!

177
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:41,900
But before that,
we have to go get Mitsuki!

178
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,600
<i>Thank you, The Scanty!</i>

179
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:59,766
FULL MOON
<i>I want to scream in</i>
<i>the winter sky that...</i>

180
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,066
<i>I want to see you right now!</i>

181
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:08,833
FULL MOON
<i>I want to see you right now!</i>

182
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:17,566
Good work. Please tell Mitsuki the plan
and where she'll need to stand.

183
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:20,933
And that's all for
the Best New Singer Award!

184
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,366
It's difficult being a manager, isn't it?

185
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:25,500
Isn't it?

186
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:27,866
Well, that doesn't usually happen.

187
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:48,633
Takuto, Meroko...

188
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:51,900
Hey, hurry up and change me
back into Mitsuki.

189
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,466
I can't meet Eichi like this.

190
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,766
Sorry!

191
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,700
What?

192
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,266
I'm sorry.

193
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,766
I sent that short email.

194
00:15:05,033 --> 00:15:06,700
The first email and...

195
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,366
the one that says he's coming home
were from Izumi.

196
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:11,266
What?

197
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,366
None of the emails were from Eichi.

198
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:16,300
And it's a lie that he's coming home.

199
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:20,800
The emails weren't real? So Eichi is...

200
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:23,433
We still don't know where he is.

201
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:24,633
No way!

202
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,800
I thought I was going to see Eichi soon.

203
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:30,866
H-Hey, Mitsuki...

204
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:48,300
HEY MITSUKI,
SORRY FOR THE SHORT NOTICE,
BUT I'M GOING TO JAPAN TODAY.
MY FLIGHT LANDS AT 15:45,
SO WOULD YOU COME GET ME
AT THE AIRPORT?
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO
SEEING YOU AT THE AIRPORT.
—EICHI

205
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:54,366
Sorry! By sending the thoughtless email,
I've made you suffer.

206
00:15:54,966 --> 00:15:56,033
I'm really sorry!

207
00:16:03,066 --> 00:16:03,966
Mitsuki...

208
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,666
It's okay.

209
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:10,766
It's okay. After all,
you did it for me, right, Takuto?

210
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:16,133
I'm going to the music festival
to sing on stage.

211
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:19,466
And I'm going to win
the Best New Singer Award for Eichi.

212
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,400
For Eichi? But you...

213
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,266
If we don't know where Eichi is,
I'll go search for him!

214
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,066
Until I met you two,
I had given up hope on everything.

215
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,566
But that's no good...

216
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:36,400
If I want to see Eichi again,
I have to go to America.

217
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:39,066
So I'm going to win
the Best New Singer Award!

218
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,000
You've gotten so strong, Mitsuki.

219
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,900
WOULD YOU LIKE TO DELETE
THIS EMAIL?
YES/NO

220
00:17:03,266 --> 00:17:04,200
Ms. Oshige!

221
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,333
Dr. Wakaoji. Did you find her?

222
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,733
I returned to the waiting room,
but there was no evidence of her.

223
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,666
It's all my fault.

224
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,833
That doesn't matter now.

225
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,900
Let's search for her together
one more time.

226
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,366
<i>That was the third nominee</i>
<i>for Best New Singer,</i>

227
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,900
<i>The Drill Boys.</i>

228
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,100
Oh no! She's on!

229
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:28,333
<i>And now, the final nominees.</i>

230
00:17:28,766 --> 00:17:29,866
It's all over!

231
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,700
<i>We can trust that</i>
<i>this wonderful performance</i>

232
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:35,233
<i>will sparkle like the moon</i>
<i>in the evening sky.</i>

233
00:17:36,033 --> 00:17:37,266
<i>Full Moon!</i>

234
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,200
<i>How long has it been</i>

235
00:17:49,466 --> 00:17:53,933
<i>since I fell in love with you?</i>

236
00:17:54,733 --> 00:18:03,033
<i>My feelings keep getting stronger.</i>

237
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:12,100
<i>They're silent like the snow,</i>

238
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:22,900
<i>but they keep building up.</i>

239
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:32,033
<i>Hold me tight, if loving someone</i>

240
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:39,033
<i>was going to feel like this</i>

241
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:42,466
<i>I wish I never found out about love.</i>

242
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,133
<i>I love you.</i>

243
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:49,966
<i>My tears won't stop.</i>

244
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:54,300
<i>If this is how it's going to be,</i>

245
00:18:54,333 --> 00:19:04,333
<i>I wish I had never met you.</i>

246
00:19:05,466 --> 00:19:12,966
<i>If the snow falls forever...</i>

247
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:23,766
<i>Will I be able to let go of</i>
<i>these thoughts of you?</i>

248
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,800
<i>Hold me tight,</i>

249
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:33,166
<i>if this is how it feels</i>

250
00:19:33,766 --> 00:19:39,433
<i>to fall in love with someone</i>

251
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,766
<i>I wish I never knew.</i>

252
00:19:42,966 --> 00:19:50,900
<i>I love you,</i>
<i>the feeling of love fills my heart.</i>

253
00:19:50,966 --> 00:19:55,766
<i>I want to scream in the winter sky that</i>

254
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:04,833
<i>I want to see you right now.</i>

255
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:21,533
That was amazing, Mitsuki!

256
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:23,300
Mitsuki, you did very well!

257
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,166
Wow! She did it! That was awesome.

258
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,833
Way to go, Mitsuki.

259
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,200
<i>Eichi, are you listening to my song...</i>

260
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:35,766
<i>from somewhere?</i>

261
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,433
Congratulations to winner
of the Best New Singer Award!

262
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:44,600
- Yay!
- Thank you!

263
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,866
I'm drinking today.

264
00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:53,333
I can't believe you didn't return until just
before your performance, you rascal!

265
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,766
I'm sorry, Ms. Oshige. Sorry.

266
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,766
Well, well, let's let it go.

267
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,500
Yeah! You won Best New Singer
with a huge lead!

268
00:21:01,766 --> 00:21:04,600
Yeah, you were number one with both
the audience votes

269
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:06,266
and with the judge's votes.

270
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,666
I know, I'm not that much of
a stick in the mud.

271
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,066
This is Mitsuki.

272
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,033
Ms. Kazumi?

273
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,233
What?!

274
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,100
Is this really true?

275
00:21:21,433 --> 00:21:24,800
Yes... yes...
Thank you very much!

276
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:27,266
What's going on, Mitsuki?

277
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:31,733
Eichi... She said she got
a lead on Eichi!

278
00:21:32,366 --> 00:21:34,333
- What?
- Really, Mitsuki?

279
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,266
Yes! That was Ms. Kazumi!

280
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,266
No way!

281
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,366
<i>This time...</i>

282
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:46,766
<i>This time, for sure,</i>
<i>we'll find Eichi!</i>

283
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:20,633
Takuto!

284
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,600
W-What's with you all of a sudden?!

285
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:24,833
You're so mean!
You know what I'm going to say!

286
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:26,966
Just give me some breathing room!

287
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,666
Gosh, do you want me to
spell it out for you?

288
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,300
Today is the romantic Christmas!

289
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:35,466
It's as though the whole town
is celebrating our love!

290
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:36,766
What?! He's gone?!

291
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,433
Wait up!

292
00:23:39,266 --> 00:23:43,333
Next time on Full Moon:
"A Present from Full Moon"

293
00:23:43,633 --> 00:23:45,033
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
