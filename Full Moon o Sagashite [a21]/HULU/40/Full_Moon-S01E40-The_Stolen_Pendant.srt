1
00:00:05,966 --> 00:00:09,333
Once in America, Mitsuki
is reunited with Ms. Kazumi,

2
00:00:09,366 --> 00:00:12,833
who gives her the address of her contact
who may know how to find Eichi.

3
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:15,933
Mitsuki is so excited to be
on the verge of finding Eichi,

4
00:00:15,966 --> 00:00:19,900
and both her throat checkup
and visit to the TV studio go well.

5
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,766
No keywords have appeared
in the Death Spirit Handbook.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,200
Looks like this is
going to be a great trip!

7
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,866
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,666
Got that?

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,666
Yes.

10
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,000
Thank you so very much
for everything.

11
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:21,900
No problem. Be careful.

12
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,900
Take care, Mitsuki.

13
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:25,800
Yes, Ms. Kazumi.

14
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:31,100
Now we're finally free from babysitting.
Right, Takuto?

15
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:33,766
Huh? Yeah, that's right.

16
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:40,500
What's the matter, Takuto?
You're sad about leaving that kid, huh?

17
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:50,433
Bye bye, Nick!

18
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:52,666
Thank you for everything.

19
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,333
I'm definitely going to see Eichi!

20
00:02:56,166 --> 00:03:00,266
And this time I will definitely
tell him how I feel!

21
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:25,066
Oh, I feel so free now that
we're without the baby!

22
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:32,333
Really, what's been up with you?

23
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:33,766
W-What?

24
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,733
You're acting a little strange today!

25
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,000
I-I'm not acting strange.

26
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,133
<i>I'm not acting strange.</i>
<i>It's only natural.</i>

27
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,433
<i>She's a human and</i>
<i>I'm a Death Spirit.</i>

28
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,033
<i>Even if I could communicate my feelings,</i>
<i>what would happen?</i>

29
00:03:55,833 --> 00:04:03,600
<i>I can't make her happy.</i>
<i>And...she likes Eichi.</i>

30
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:13,533
<i>There's no need for me.</i>
<i>That's right. It's only natural!</i>

31
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,800
It looks like there's time
until the next bus.

32
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:39,633
So, what should we do?

33
00:04:39,766 --> 00:04:40,433
Huh?

34
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:44,200
Do you even need to ask?

35
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:47,100
Sightseeing!

36
00:04:54,933 --> 00:04:57,733
All right. Time to make
some dough for today.

37
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,433
We're here!

38
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,566
Wow!

39
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:13,333
It's amazing!

40
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:15,333
That's Eagle Valley!

41
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,933
Come on! Let's ride that
down to the valley floor.

42
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:25,866
Wow!
Ms. Oshige, I wanna go too!

43
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,333
What? You too?
But you can't go alone.

44
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:34,766
You really don't get it!
It'll be fine since I'll be with her!

45
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,633
Stupid! That's what worries us!

46
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,933
I see, Takuto is going too. Then there's
nothing to worry about, I guess.

47
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,600
What's that supposed to mean?

48
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,966
Thank you, Ms. Oshige.
Let's go, Takuto.

49
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,766
All right.

50
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:52,200
Hey, wait!

51
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:56,533
Whoops!

52
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:05,200
I'm so sorry!

53
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:26,133
Wow...

54
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:28,300
It's like a Baumkuchen.

55
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,900
Yeah, I wonder how long
it takes to get like this?

56
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,500
Ahem!

57
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:39,666
This is called a "stratum," and it takes
approximately 43,000 years to form.

58
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:43,333
This dramatic gorge formation
started two billion years ago,

59
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:45,566
and the erosion
continues to this day.

60
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,666
Oh, is that so?
You know so much, Meroko!

61
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:49,800
Ahem!

62
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,166
Hmm, I wonder.

63
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,533
W-What?

64
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:55,666
Are you just making stuff up again?

65
00:06:55,833 --> 00:07:00,733
How rude! It's not made up.
I'm just relaying what's in here!

66
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,666
But nature can be really huge!
Oh, I know.

67
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,466
Let's take a picture since we're here.

68
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,300
That's a good idea!

69
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:11,200
Yeah!

70
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,700
Do you want me to
take the photo for you?

71
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,166
Huh?

72
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,866
You can't take a souvenir photo
by yourself, can you?

73
00:07:20,766 --> 00:07:22,000
Here, give me it to me.

74
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:25,600
Oh, yes, please.

75
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:28,066
All right, Takuto, Meroko.

76
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,766
Okay?

77
00:07:31,966 --> 00:07:32,966
- Yeah.
- Yup.

78
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,700
Are you ready, young lady?

79
00:07:40,933 --> 00:07:41,933
Yes!

80
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,033
<i>It's a cheap and worthless necklace,</i>
<i>but I'll make it the start to my work here.</i>

81
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:56,033
All right, smile!

82
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,800
Thank you very much.

83
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:04,533
Don't mention it.

84
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,500
I'm sorry, are you all right?

85
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:17,566
Y-Yes.

86
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,166
All right then.

87
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,233
Thank you.

88
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,933
Mitsuki, shouldn't we be
going back soon?

89
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:27,566
Yeah, we should.

90
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,466
It's gone.

91
00:08:44,266 --> 00:08:45,333
What's the matter, Mitsuki?

92
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,533
It's gone! It's gone!

93
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,900
What's gone?

94
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:51,733
The pendant is gone!

95
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:55,033
What am I gonna do?!
Without that... Without that...

96
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,600
Calm down!
Calm down, Mitsuki!

97
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:00,066
What should we do, Takuto?

98
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:04,066
Well, we won't make it in time
if we don't go back now.

99
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:09,433
Takuto, Meroko, you guys go back first!
I'll stay here and look for it.

100
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:11,133
I'll go back after I find it!

101
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:13,933
You know we can't do that!

102
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,500
B-But... Without it...

103
00:09:20,566 --> 00:09:21,666
What should we do?

104
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,866
Is it that important?

105
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:29,433
All right, I know.

106
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,333
Mitsuki and I will stay here
and look for the pendant.

107
00:09:37,566 --> 00:09:38,233
What?!

108
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,333
Hey Takuto! Are you serious?

109
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:47,166
Yeah. So you go up and let them
know about this. Let's go, Mitsuki.

110
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:50,633
J-J-Just a minute!

111
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,666
Why am I left behind again?!
Jeez! Forget them!

112
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,100
It left.

113
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:15,500
I wonder what happened
to Mitsuki and them.

114
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:19,033
You don't think they've gotten in
an accident or something, do you?!

115
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,566
Let's go look for them.

116
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,900
Even though I said what I said,
I just can't leave them on their own.

117
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:33,200
Why am I so admirable?
And that idiot Takuto...

118
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:37,066
Lucky! Perfect timing!

119
00:10:38,466 --> 00:10:40,866
Hey! It's awful, just awful!

120
00:10:41,366 --> 00:10:43,900
Hey, are you listening?
I said, it's awful!

121
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,500
Oh yeah...

122
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:48,766
So that's what happened.

123
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:50,533
Really, Meroko?

124
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:51,300
Yup.

125
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,366
Then we need to hurry
down to get them.

126
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,000
You're right, let's hurry.

127
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:07,666
You had it on when
we took the picture, right?

128
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:09,033
Yeah.

129
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:18,033
Let's look for it again
on the route here.

130
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:20,033
Come on.

131
00:11:20,766 --> 00:11:23,800
There's no use getting depressed, right?
Let's look for it.

132
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,166
Yeah.

133
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:40,366
Let's go back to where
we took the photo again.

134
00:11:44,066 --> 00:11:45,066
Takuto...

135
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,866
Please!

136
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,666
As I've said, all the drivers
have gone home for the night,

137
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,533
and there's no way
we can operate it.

138
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,700
No way!

139
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,966
Isn't there some way?

140
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,333
I'll go.

141
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:02,433
Axel...

142
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:28,366
Will you be all right, Axel?

143
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,166
Thank you so very much!

144
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:31,466
Leave it to me!

145
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,733
It's not here after all.
We don't need to look anymore, Takuto.

146
00:12:50,966 --> 00:12:51,966
I'm sorry.

147
00:12:52,466 --> 00:12:55,033
Hey, you're giving up so easily?

148
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,033
Well, it's already so late.

149
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:02,366
It's something important to you, right?

150
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:03,700
Yeah.

151
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:08,766
Eichi gave me that pendant.

152
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,933
O-Oh, I see!

153
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:14,266
But it's all right!

154
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,933
Because I get to see him soon!

155
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:21,733
It's too bad I lost it,
but it's all right!

156
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,300
B-But...

157
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,133
We've already made Ms. Oshige
and the others worry, so let's go back.

158
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:31,433
Takuto, thanks for
looking for it with me!

159
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,800
What?! This is terrible!

160
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:42,766
Takuto, what do we do?

161
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:45,500
I guess there's no choice.
I'll carry you and fly up.

162
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,633
Are you Mitsuki?

163
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,533
Huh? Oh, yes.

164
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,866
Huh?

165
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,966
No.
Don't come any closer!

166
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,533
All right, let's go.

167
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:06,833
I don't want to!

168
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:09,666
Hey, you!

169
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,600
Get away from Mitsuki!

170
00:14:13,766 --> 00:14:15,766
Oh, there's someone with her.

171
00:14:16,033 --> 00:14:17,033
Takuto!

172
00:14:17,633 --> 00:14:19,100
What are you planning
to do with Mitsuki?!

173
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:22,533
I wasn't planning to do anything.
You come with us too.

174
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:27,533
Now, hurry up.

175
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:34,900
Wow, it's like a Western!

176
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,266
It's from the pioneering days.

177
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,933
Thank you very much.

178
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:44,666
Sorry for surprising you earlier.

179
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:49,200
No, sorry for jumping to conclusions
even though you had come to rescue us.

180
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:51,333
It was a pretty good tackle.

181
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,433
After we eat, we'll sleep.

182
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:56,033
We'll go back first thing
tomorrow morning.

183
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,700
Okay!

184
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:01,166
We'll look for your lost item
again tomorrow.

185
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,500
Takuto?

186
00:15:40,366 --> 00:15:42,833
Man, I'm such a loser!

187
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:44,533
<i>Damn it!</i>

188
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,233
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>
<i>At this rate, I'll eventually...</i>

189
00:15:48,266 --> 00:15:49,266
Takuto?

190
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:56,800
S-Stupid!
It's dangerous to walk around alone!

191
00:15:57,466 --> 00:15:58,466
S-Sorry.

192
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,500
But since you went out,
I followed you!

193
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,133
Can I sit down?

194
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:09,300
Yeah.

195
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:15,966
I'm sorry.

196
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,166
About what?

197
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,066
For not being able to
find your pendant.

198
00:16:19,266 --> 00:16:21,800
No, it's really all right.

199
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,066
You looked really hard
for it too, Takuto.

200
00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:30,000
Hey, Takuto?

201
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:30,800
Huh?

202
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:35,500
I'm really glad that I met you, Takuto.

203
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,266
What?

204
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:38,700
Because I met you,
I was able to become a singer.

205
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:40,533
And I was able to come
all the way to America.

206
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,466
I didn't think I'd be able see Eichi again,
but I'm gonna get to see him soon too.

207
00:16:45,633 --> 00:16:50,600
Even though sometimes when
I talk about Eichi, you get moody.

208
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,233
Th-That's...

209
00:16:52,266 --> 00:16:57,566
But whatever happens, you're always
on my side, and you always help me.

210
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,400
Th-That's...

211
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,400
Why?

212
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,566
What?

213
00:17:03,033 --> 00:17:06,000
Why do you always
do so much for me?

214
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,900
Th-That's...
That's because...

215
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:21,100
That's because you're a little loser,
and you can't take care of yourself!

216
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:21,800
What?

217
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
I'm going back!

218
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,933
Wait for me, Takuto!

219
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,566
I wish we had a better
hideout than this.

220
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:53,766
Oh, good morning, Eric.

221
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,866
Did you guys drink all night?

222
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,433
Get it together!
We need to make some dough today too!

223
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,900
Oh?
That guy...

224
00:18:15,633 --> 00:18:16,966
What's the matter, Eric?

225
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:18,866
O-Oh no!
Run!

226
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:21,766
That man... I think he's...

227
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:27,233
Just as I thought!
He's the thief that targets tourists!

228
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,800
I see! So she didn't
drop the pendant!

229
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,633
He stole it back then!

230
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:36,333
Huh?

231
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:38,666
Otherwise, he wouldn't run away!

232
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,266
W-Wait!

233
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,600
Wait!

234
00:18:49,633 --> 00:18:51,233
I can't keep going!

235
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,833
M-Me neither.

236
00:18:58,366 --> 00:18:59,366
Wait!

237
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,500
- What?
- Huh?

238
00:19:08,466 --> 00:19:09,766
- We've been spared.
- We've been spared.

239
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,466
You can't get away now!

240
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:25,833
All right!
Give us back the pendant!

241
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:39,066
Takuto!

242
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:40,933
What're you gonna do?

243
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,700
A-All right. I'll give it back,
so forgive me!

244
00:19:46,633 --> 00:19:47,633
Here you go!

245
00:19:51,366 --> 00:19:53,166
Damn it!

246
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:00,466
Takuto!

247
00:20:06,766 --> 00:20:08,000
What an idiot.

248
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:19,833
Takuto! Takuto!

249
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:24,966
What do I do?
Takuto is... Takuto is...

250
00:20:28,366 --> 00:20:30,733
What're you crying for,
you little loser?

251
00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:39,966
You're so stupid, Takuto!

252
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,433
Takuto?

253
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,633
Stupid, stupid!
You're so stupid, Takuto!

254
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:50,666
What the... I got it back for you!
Aren't you happy?!

255
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,266
I am happy! But why did you
do such a reckless thing?!

256
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:59,166
When I go back to this form, I can fly,
and besides, Death Spirits can't die!

257
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,000
That's not the point!
I was worried!

258
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,800
Takuto, where are you?

259
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:12,700
Why? Why do you always act so tough?
You did such a dangerous thing!

260
00:21:12,933 --> 00:21:14,566
Oh, enough, enough!

261
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,766
Answer me, Takuto!

262
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,333
Why should I, you little loser?

263
00:21:18,366 --> 00:21:19,566
What did you say?!

264
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,400
Takuto!

265
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,433
I-It's... It's because I like you,
of course!

266
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:23,000
Hey, Takuto, what are you doing
telling her you like her?!

267
00:23:23,033 --> 00:23:24,966
Gosh, you're so annoying!

268
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,400
Don't call me annoying!

269
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:32,466
Takuto, you're a Death Spirit and
she's a human! It's forbidden!

270
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,400
And... And...

271
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:37,266
Eichi's gonna be in
the picture soon too,right?

272
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,133
You don't have to tell me twice!

273
00:23:40,066 --> 00:23:43,833
Next time on Full Moon:
"To the Town Where Eichi Lives!"

274
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:45,233
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
