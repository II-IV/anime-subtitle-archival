1
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,066
<i>Since when has it been a lie?</i>

2
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,266
<i>How did it all happen?</i>

3
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,566
<i>Does she have
something I don't have?</i>

4
00:01:55,633 --> 00:02:02,233
<i>Images that I keep imagining
appear to me everywhere...</i>

5
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:14,600
Everyone!
Thank you very much for today!

6
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,333
This is our last song!

7
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,700
N-No way...

8
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:32,366
E-Eichi?

9
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,233
You made your dream of becoming
a singer come true, huh?

10
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:39,266
Y-Yeah. You, too, Eichi?

11
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:40,233
Yeah.

12
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:41,933
That's great!

13
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,266
Mitsuki...

14
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,766
I like you.

15
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:51,033
Eichi...

16
00:02:52,566 --> 00:02:53,966
Eichi!

17
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:10,766
A dream?

18
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:13,600
Eichi?

19
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:18,666
<i>I Want to Sing!</i>

20
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:23,133
Hey! Look above you!

21
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:28,500
Upon the wide night sky.

22
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:32,600
I'll shine with all my might...

23
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,033
It'll be okay, right?

24
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:37,233
Yes!

25
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,233
Upon the wide night sky.

26
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:46,933
I'll shine with all my—

27
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,100
<i>Ouch...</i>

28
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:53,766
Mitsuki.

29
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:57,333
I told you many times
to stop, didn't I?

30
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,233
Music is disgusting.

31
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:03,200
It reminds me of your father
and makes me sick.

32
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:05,200
I'm sorry. But I...

33
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:06,400
Don't talk back to me!

34
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:08,433
Okay.

35
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,100
Has your fever gone down?

36
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:12,100
Yes.

37
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:14,266
I see. That's good.

38
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,766
Dr. Wakaoji is here.

39
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:19,233
Get yourself together.

40
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,833
Dr. Wakaoji!

41
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:23,133
I'm sorry to trouble you
on your day off.

42
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:27,266
No, don't worry about it.
More importantly, how is she?

43
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,500
She seems quite a bit better
this morning.

44
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:31,033
I see.

45
00:04:31,566 --> 00:04:32,900
Morning, Mitsuki.

46
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,433
Good morning!

47
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:43,733
The lump is a little red, isn't it?
Shall I apply some medicine on it?

48
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:44,833
Okay...

49
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,900
Okay, that's it.

50
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,400
Thank you.

51
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:51,466
Umm...Dr. Wakaoji.

52
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:53,533
What is it, Mitsuki?

53
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,100
Can you make it

54
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:59,166
so I'll be having a complete
physical examination at your hospital now?

55
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:01,266
I bet you're setting up
an alibi, right?

56
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,233
So, where are you going?

57
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:08,633
It's a letter of acceptance from

58
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:12,266
the first round of
the Seed Records new artist audition.

59
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,400
I sent it in secret
from my grandmother... So...

60
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:18,200
No.

61
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,500
What?

62
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:21,700
You developed a fever
and left early yesterday, right?

63
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,500
And there's the swelling
in your throat.

64
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:25,800
So as your attending physician,
I can't allow it.

65
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,733
But here I passed the first round!

66
00:05:29,033 --> 00:05:31,900
But as you are now,
you can't sing in a loud voice, right?

67
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Auditions will have to wait until after
your throat has gotten better.

68
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:43,233
Mitsuki, let's operate while
the lump is still small.

69
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:44,933
I don't want an operation.

70
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:49,300
I might lose my voice, right?

71
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:54,466
Given the location,
the possibility of that is undeniable.

72
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:56,733
Then I won't have the operation.

73
00:05:58,033 --> 00:05:58,900
Doctor...

74
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,866
As opposed to dying, I'm really scared of
becoming unable to sing.

75
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,066
So...

76
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:08,400
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,633
Mitsuki...

78
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:13,900
About Mitsuki...

79
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:17,566
Could I ask you to somehow
convince her...to have the operation?

80
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:18,933
I told her many times!

81
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,433
But it's like she doesn't listen!

82
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:25,366
Everything about her
is just like my late daughter.

83
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:27,233
I've given up.

84
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,933
I see.

85
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:37,733
I messed up again.

86
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,666
So all I can do is wait
for my throat to heal?

87
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:52,033
<i>Mitsuki. Promise me...</i>

88
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,800
<i>that we'll be closer to
our dreams when we next meet.</i>

89
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,700
<i>Me, an astronomer,
and you, a singer, okay?</i>

90
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:03,133
<i>Promise...</i>

91
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,100
Yes...

92
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,833
But...I wonder when that will be.

93
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,133
Eichi.

94
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:18,200
What?!

95
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
All right.

96
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,933
<i>Wh-Who is that?</i>

97
00:07:24,966 --> 00:07:26,800
<i>And how did he
get through the wall?!</i>

98
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:31,300
So this is her. Mitsuki Koyama.
Twelve years old.

99
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:32,200
<i>Huh?</i>

100
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:34,333
<i>How does he know my name?!</i>

101
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:36,666
Wait, Takuto!

102
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,133
<i>A-Another one's appeared.</i>

103
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,833
<i>- What are these guys?</i>
- You always go off by yourself.

104
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:41,566
It's just that you're slow.

105
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:45,466
Hey, is that the sort of attitude
you should have towards a superior?

106
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,800
Quit being so patronizing.

107
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,833
- My!
- Umm...

108
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,866
Who're you guys?

109
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,200
Can you see us?

110
00:07:56,366 --> 00:07:56,866
Yes.

111
00:07:58,433 --> 00:08:00,433
Wh-Wh-Wh-Why can you see us?!

112
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:02,966
Real humans shouldn't be
able to see us, right?!

113
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,500
But I can see you.

114
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,966
What do we do at
a time like this?

115
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,266
Since it's come to this, we have no choice.
It's time for that!

116
00:08:09,466 --> 00:08:09,933
Yeah.

117
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:12,833
It's unusual for us to give
our names after being asked, but...

118
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,433
We are the Death Spirits
who can even quiet crying children!

119
00:08:16,966 --> 00:08:17,500
Takuto!

120
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,466
Meroko!

121
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,266
The two of us are...

122
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,633
- Green Onion Ramen!
- Green Onion Ramen!

123
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:28,766
"Green Onion Ramen," they said.

124
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:30,533
Sounds delicious.

125
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:33,500
Takuto, I really don't like
this duo name.

126
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:35,966
Deal with it.
The chief decided on it.

127
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,666
Rabbit ears and cat ears. How soft!

128
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,866
Th-This is for pediatrics, so...

129
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:43,966
Pediatrics?

130
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,666
What? They have Death Spirits
for kids, too?

131
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,166
Huh? Kids?

132
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:50,733
Come to think of it,
Death Spirits...

133
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,600
You've come for me?

134
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:53,533
That's right.

135
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,800
Whoa-whoa!

136
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,600
Don't say that!

137
00:08:56,633 --> 00:08:57,666
It's too late.

138
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,566
I'm going to die today.

139
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,400
Keep cool.
You'll actually die in one year.

140
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:03,566
One year from now?

141
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,100
Could it be that my illness
will get worse?

142
00:09:08,233 --> 00:09:09,600
Well, that might be.

143
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,400
Oh, I'm sorry. Please don't cry.

144
00:09:14,566 --> 00:09:15,366
She's not crying?

145
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,000
Well, anyway, while
we still have the time...

146
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,733
Let's see. At a time like this...
Let me see, let me see...

147
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:26,600
Actually, it seems there's someone
who's attempting to prevent your death.

148
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:29,933
Then I'm not going to die?

149
00:09:29,966 --> 00:09:31,333
No, that's not how it works.

150
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:33,500
You can't change destiny.

151
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:34,500
I see.

152
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,366
<i>If I have only one year of life left,
then there's really no time to lose!</i>

153
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:43,800
Hey, Takuto.

154
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,466
What were you thinking,
babbling like that?!

155
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:49,933
I'm going to report this to the chief!

156
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:51,533
It's cool.

157
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,900
We've been seen, anyway.

158
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:56,333
The point is that
one year later, she'll...What?

159
00:09:58,666 --> 00:09:59,500
Where'd she go?

160
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:06,766
Takuto! Over there!

161
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:08,600
Wait, you shrimp!

162
00:10:08,633 --> 00:10:10,133
Stop!

163
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,233
Hey!

164
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:17,333
Hold it!

165
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,666
Taxi!

166
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,633
Darn it! We were just a step away.

167
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:30,100
Out of the way!

168
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,133
M-Moron!

169
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,533
<i>Thank you, Death Spirits.
I've made up my mind to audition.</i>

170
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:42,333
<i>If I only have one year left,
I'll become a singer by then!</i>

171
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,233
Wow...
So this is the place.

172
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:06,500
<i>At last, Eichi.</i>

173
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,133
<i>I'll deliver on my promise to you,
without fail.</i>

174
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,400
Where'd she go off to?

175
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,333
She looks mild-mannered,
but she took us for fools.

176
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:33,633
Hey! She's here!

177
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,300
Really?!

178
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:36,766
I wonder what she's doing.

179
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,533
Who cares?!

180
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,233
Hey! She'll run away again
if we look like this.

181
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:44,400
Huh? I know that.

182
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,966
Jeez. Why won't it open?

183
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:50,566
I wonder if there is
a key somewhere.

184
00:11:50,966 --> 00:11:51,466
Oh!

185
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,333
That's open!

186
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,866
Okay. All I can
do is go from there.

187
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:56,566
Yeah!

188
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:00,733
How cute!

189
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,466
I wonder what these are.

190
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,966
I wonder if they're decorations.

191
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,433
Let's see how it feels.

192
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,933
What?!

193
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,033
I got you.

194
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:17,300
Death Spirits!

195
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:20,233
We can't have you going out and
about on your own.

196
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:22,400
Now, let's go home quietly.

197
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,366
Right-right.

198
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,333
H-Hey, wait! I'm gonna audition!

199
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:30,033
I don't want to go home like this.

200
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:33,166
Then why were you trying to get in
through a place like that?

201
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:35,166
Yeah. Go in the front door.

202
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:38,400
I can't do that because
they said I don't look sixteen.

203
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:40,966
Don't I look sixteen?

204
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:42,800
Well...no.

205
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,800
<i>What?</i>

206
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:47,566
I'm going in through there,
after all!

207
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,366
Don't, you moron!
It's dangerous!

208
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,633
It won't do any good
if you get hurt or something!

209
00:12:51,766 --> 00:12:55,100
But if I don't hurry,
registration will end.

210
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,233
I have to become a singer,
no matter what!

211
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:01,766
Is something wrong?

212
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:06,033
When...I talk...loudly...my throat...

213
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,233
Then an audition is impossible.

214
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,066
But...

215
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,966
Please. I have one year to live.

216
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,533
At the very least,
please let me audition.

217
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,733
If I fail the audition...
I'll behave and listen to what you say.

218
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,333
So...please...

219
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:25,700
You really will, right?

220
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,466
Okay.

221
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:35,466
I'll make you sixteen years old.

222
00:13:38,266 --> 00:13:43,500
While I'm at it, I'll make your body healthy
while you're sixteen.

223
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,466
What?

224
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:49,433
Take it.

225
00:13:51,566 --> 00:13:54,466
When I give the signal,
it will circulate through your body.

226
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:57,333
It'll feel strange, but stick it out.

227
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,166
Good girl.

228
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:30,766
Don't you feel it?

229
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:32,833
No...

230
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,066
Then go see for yourself.

231
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:39,933
<i>Whoa.</i>

232
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:45,100
<i>Amazing! I'm really sixteen.</i>

233
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,733
Thanks, Mr. Death Spirit!
Thank you very much!

234
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,300
Hey! Get away from Takuto!

235
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:52,566
Are you satisfied?

236
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,133
Umm...I'd like to dye my hair, too.

237
00:14:58,233 --> 00:15:00,200
What's the meaning of this, Takuto?!

238
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:00,966
What?

239
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,300
To think, after ignoring
the orders of the higher-ups,

240
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,133
you'd use your powers on her.

241
00:15:05,266 --> 00:15:07,066
You're asking for big trouble!

242
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:10,233
D-Don't tell me that
you're falling for that girl.

243
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,033
Huh?

244
00:15:11,366 --> 00:15:13,400
N-No! You're mine, Takuto.

245
00:15:13,533 --> 00:15:15,100
I won't hand you over
no matter what.

246
00:15:15,366 --> 00:15:17,700
Since when do I belong to you?

247
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,266
Don't worry. That's not it.

248
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:20,900
Huh?

249
00:15:21,366 --> 00:15:24,633
It'll be a problem if she whines and
doesn't go to the spirit world

250
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,400
when she dies because
she has a lingering attachment, right?

251
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:29,033
That's true, but...

252
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:31,200
But, what do we do if she passes?

253
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:32,666
That would be a lingering attachment,
wouldn't it?

254
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,933
It'll be okay.
She won't pass that easily.

255
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:39,266
She's sixteen and
she'll attend the audition.

256
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,933
She'll experience reality and sink
like a stone in the audition.

257
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:44,800
She won't have even
a bit of a lingering attachment.

258
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:55,433
<i>Wow. There are only cute girls.</i>

259
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,933
<i>I wonder if I'm too plain.</i>

260
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,933
<i>Everyone's looking.</i>

261
00:16:19,966 --> 00:16:23,900
<i>I wonder if I look weird...
L-Like a geek or something?</i>

262
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,766
Can I sit next to you?

263
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:27,800
Oh... Sure...

264
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,366
Who're you affiliated with?

265
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:34,833
Affiliated?

266
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:37,566
Aren't you with a theatre group
or an office or something?

267
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:38,266
No.

268
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,066
No kidding?

269
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,766
<i>What?</i>

270
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,133
<i>Am I supposed to be in
a theatre group or something?</i>

271
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,833
Well, I feel bad for you,
but it's futile.

272
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,433
What?

273
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:48,300
This is just between us.

274
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,400
It seems it's already been decided
who's going to pass.

275
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,266
What? Then why
have an audition?!

276
00:16:57,366 --> 00:16:59,200
S-Sorry, sorry.

277
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:02,300
Why?

278
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,666
This audition is going to be massively
covered by the morning news,

279
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,566
tabloid shows and the like.

280
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,500
With all that attention,

281
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:11,966
the girl who is "chosen from among
tens of thousands"

282
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,566
will be that famous.

283
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,000
It's the perfect chance
to market a new face.

284
00:17:17,133 --> 00:17:18,200
I see...

285
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,933
So you...passed.

286
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:23,333
Sorry.

287
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:25,833
<i>We will now begin the judging.</i>

288
00:17:26,366 --> 00:17:27,100
Bye.

289
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,866
<i>When your number is called,
please enter.</i>

290
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,766
<i>Now then, starting with number one.</i>

291
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:36,566
<i>I see. So that's how it is.</i>

292
00:17:36,866 --> 00:17:38,466
<i>It's kind of sad, somehow.</i>

293
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,566
<i>I thought it was
a more innocent world.</i>

294
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,400
<i>You're never to say that
you want to be a singer.</i>

295
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:48,466
<i>I disobeyed my grandmother.</i>

296
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:50,666
<i>Auditions will have to wait until
after your throat has gotten better.</i>

297
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,066
<i>And I was stopped
by Dr. Wakaoji, too.</i>

298
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,966
<i>You'll die one year from now.</i>

299
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:57,000
<i>One year from now...</i>

300
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,700
<i>What am I doing here?</i>

301
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,800
<i>Eichi...</i>

302
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,666
<i>...twenty-one...</i>

303
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,966
<i>Number twenty-one, come on in.</i>

304
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:13,366
Number twenty-one, Mitsuki Koyama.

305
00:18:13,566 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm very glad to be here.

306
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:16,766
What genre do you like?

307
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:19,466
I like...Japanese pop.

308
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,600
Is there something you want
to try doing if you become a singer?

309
00:18:22,866 --> 00:18:25,600
Uh...I...I just want to sing.

310
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:27,433
I like singing, so...

311
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:28,666
Then sing.

312
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:29,800
Sound, please.

313
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:35,433
Oh, no. She's so nervous.

314
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,633
There's no way she'll pass.

315
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:44,100
The only thing that doesn't change
my dream that I've been...

316
00:18:44,366 --> 00:18:44,900
Huh?

317
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:47,700
Hold on! You're voice is too soft!

318
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:49,633
Sing a bit louder!

319
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,066
What...louder?

320
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,633
What's wrong with your throat?

321
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,566
Does it hurt?

322
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,600
Then I guess singing
is impossible.

323
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,600
Impossible.

324
00:18:58,066 --> 00:18:59,800
It's impossible, after all.

325
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:02,933
I'm sorry!

326
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:04,800
Are you going to run away?!

327
00:19:06,366 --> 00:19:07,500
Mr. Death Spirit...

328
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,700
Your throat is okay. Sing.

329
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:12,133
You like singing, don't you?!

330
00:19:16,433 --> 00:19:18,633
<i>You truly do like singing, Mitsuki.</i>

331
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:22,000
<i>I also...love your songs.</i>

332
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,566
<i>Right...</i>

333
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:28,066
I'm sorry. Please let me
sing again.

334
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,133
Oh, okay...

335
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:30,600
Sound, please.

336
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,233
<i>It's okay if it's rough.</i>

337
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,733
<i>No matter how tight
my chest feels...</i>

338
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:38,300
<i>Pain... Affection...</i>

339
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,233
<i>They're all fragments of my dream.</i>

340
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:51,300
<i>The only thing that doesn't change
the dream that I've been holding.</i>

341
00:19:51,833 --> 00:20:03,566
<i>How do I appear to you now to
those young eyes from the past?</i>

342
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:14,366
<i>Hey! Look above you!
Upon the wide night sky</i>

343
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:20,400
<i>I'll shine with all my might.
So hurry up and find the full moon.</i>

344
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:22,566
<i>Wow. My voice is loud.</i>

345
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:24,033
<i>I can breath all right, too.</i>

346
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:25,900
<i>I didn't know I could use
my voice like this.</i>

347
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,166
<i>How fun!</i>

348
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:38,100
<i>Let's sing a song—together forever,
that's everything I will do...</i>

349
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:48,166
<i>Day by day—I will hold fate
and the hope for tomorrow in my heart...</i>

350
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:58,300
<i>Let's sing a song—I can bear any hardship
when I'm always together with you.</i>

351
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:04,333
<i>More and more—I wanna be closer
and closer to you...</i>

352
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:05,433
She...

353
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,000
<i>...even though you are already here.</i>

354
00:21:16,533 --> 00:21:18,800
Umm... I'm finished.

355
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,000
Call Mr. Miya!

356
00:21:21,033 --> 00:21:21,933
And Mr. Ishikawa, too!

357
00:21:21,966 --> 00:21:22,400
Sure.

358
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:24,066
Nishida, send the others home.

359
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:25,633
We've settled on number twenty-one!

360
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,066
Okay!

361
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,233
What do we do about this?

362
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:29,933
<i>What?!
They decided on me?!</i>

363
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,533
<i>Today's auditions are complete.</i>

364
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,766
<i>And the third round...</i>

365
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,900
- Takuto.
<i>- that we had planned will not be held.</i>

366
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,633
<i>W-What should I do, Eichi?
I passed.</i>

367
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:24,366
What have you done, Takuto?
She really passed the audition!

368
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,100
Shut up.
I don't care.

369
00:23:26,966 --> 00:23:29,466
Do you mean...
you've fallen for her?!

370
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,133
What? That's not possible!

371
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:34,833
You sure can't, because she loves
a boy named Eichi.

372
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,333
She wants to become a singer because
of a promise that she made with him.

373
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,033
W-What?!

374
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,366
That's an impure reason...
It's for a boy?

375
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,166
Next time on Full Moon:
"My Promise to Eichi"

376
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:47,833
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
