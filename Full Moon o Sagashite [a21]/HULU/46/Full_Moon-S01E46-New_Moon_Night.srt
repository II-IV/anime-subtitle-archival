1
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:08,666
Grandma!

2
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:10,300
No!

3
00:00:10,466 --> 00:00:12,366
It's useless. It's too late.

4
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:14,233
Grandma!

5
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:16,400
What's too late?

6
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:21,833
Takuto!

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,300
Grandma!

8
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:27,066
Don't worry.
She just fainted.

9
00:00:29,066 --> 00:00:32,433
Izumi, you little...
I'm not going to forgive you this time!

10
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:14,033
Oh boy, now I'm the bad guy.

11
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,600
I was just trying to take
her soul for you Meroko.

12
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,200
Izumi...

13
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:25,766
More importantly, you remember
all of it now, right, Takuto?

14
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:31,133
Or should I call you
Takuto Kira of Route L?

15
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:35,933
Y-You!
How did you know that?!

16
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:41,700
I'd love to hear you sing
one of these days

17
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:44,666
before you become a ghost.

18
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:50,133
<i>Takuto, do you remember</i>
<i>your past now?</i>

19
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:55,066
<i>Route L?</i>
<i>Dad and Dr. Wakaoji's band?</i>

20
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:05,700
Takuto!

21
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:10,166
Did you really remember?!
Hey!

22
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Takuto!

23
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:15,133
That's right.
I am Takuto Kira from Route L.

24
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:20,900
Mitsuki, I was the vocalist of the band
that your father and Keichi were in.

25
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
You were, Takuto?

26
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,000
Takuto!

27
00:03:24,366 --> 00:03:25,866
You know what will happen

28
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,000
if you remember your days
as a human being, don't you?!

29
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,866
Yeah.

30
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:33,700
In that case, why?
Please, forget! Forget all of that!

31
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:36,200
It's all right, Meroko.

32
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:37,466
No, it's not all right!

33
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:42,466
I don't want you to become a ghost
under any circumstances, Takuto!

34
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:45,033
Takuto is gonna be a ghost?

35
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:51,333
It can't be helped, Mero.

36
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:55,366
Takuto wasn't cut out to be
a Death Spirit from the start,

37
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
so just forget it.

38
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,633
But poor guy,
becoming a Death Spirit

39
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:04,600
and then getting assigned to
the daughter of his former bandmate.

40
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:07,433
That's none of your business.

41
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,300
That might not be true.

42
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:13,700
What if I had arranged
for that to happen?

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,666
What?

44
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:16,533
You did, Izumi?

45
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:18,666
I'm just saying that
hypothetically.

46
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,200
I just saw Mitsuki's name on
a pediatrician's list by chance.

47
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,033
Izumi, do you understand
what you've done?

48
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:31,933
Do you really think something
like that is forgivable?

49
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:34,133
I'm only saying this
hypothetically.

50
00:04:34,966 --> 00:04:39,066
Besides, it's just another dropout
Death Spirit becoming a ghost.

51
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,433
That happens all the time.

52
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,700
If that happened,

53
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:45,466
you, who loved me before,
could pair up with me again.

54
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:48,133
That wouldn't be such
a bad thing for you, would it?

55
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:50,100
Who would want to
pair up with you?

56
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,533
No, you couldn't turn down
such a good offer, Mero.

57
00:04:54,933 --> 00:04:56,766
Whatever the circumstances,

58
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,833
you have never contradicted
any of my proposals.

59
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,966
Don't forget that you
betrayed Takuto too.

60
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:08,700
I taught you, didn't I?
That people's feelings are precarious.

61
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:12,533
Get out of here.

62
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:15,233
Get out of here!

63
00:05:17,866 --> 00:05:18,866
Takuto!

64
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,000
Why are you getting
so heated up?

65
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,000
Shut up!

66
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,833
I don't want to see the face
of a scumbag like you!

67
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:28,733
What a thing to say.

68
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:33,900
I think a person who can't even do
their job right is more of a scumbag.

69
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:35,533
Shut up!

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,600
The person who
remembered was you.

71
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:44,566
You're just getting
what you deserve.

72
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,666
Takuto!

73
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,300
How petty that he can't
sever his ties with his past.

74
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,166
You're the petty one!

75
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,666
Does being a Death Spirit
make you so important?!

76
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:08,633
Does reaping people's lives
make you so important?!

77
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,900
What is so wrong with
remembering my past?

78
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:18,133
It's... It's a testament
to my life!

79
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,800
Stop! Please stop!

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,333
It's not about
being important.

81
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:39,266
As a Death Spirit,
we must simply accept it.

82
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,766
It's an eternal punishment.

83
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:46,866
Takuto!

84
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:51,200
I'll bid my farewell to
Takuto the Death Spirit.

85
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:55,500
Next time we meet,
you'll probably be a ghost.

86
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,100
Bye bye, Takuto.

87
00:07:04,766 --> 00:07:05,833
Damn it...

88
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:06,866
Takuto...

89
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:12,733
Mitsuki, I won't let you die
like this no matter what!

90
00:07:14,466 --> 00:07:16,400
Are you really okay with everything
just coming to an end like this?

91
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,300
Are you really okay
with never singing again?!

92
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:25,433
But... But... Singing...
For what reason?

93
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:32,466
I no longer have
any reason to sing.

94
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,466
Do you need a reason to sing?

95
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:39,966
Don't you sing because
you love to sing?

96
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,600
You love to sing, right?
That's why you've been singing, right?

97
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:49,133
So what happened?
It's not like you started to hate singing.

98
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:50,433
And now you're giving it up?

99
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,100
Are you going to waste
the remainder of your life?

100
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:56,933
Yeah.

101
00:07:57,366 --> 00:07:58,366
Mitsuki...

102
00:07:58,966 --> 00:08:02,100
I love to sing,
but I don't want to anymore.

103
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:06,366
The reason I sang until now
was to get closer to Eichi.

104
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,033
But now Eichi is gone.

105
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,500
If Eichi in heaven heard you saying that,
he would be very disappointed.

106
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:19,500
He'd think that it was a waste to
fall in love with such a weak person.

107
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:24,733
You might be right.

108
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,733
But that's fine with me.

109
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:32,633
I was ill with a throat disease,
and if I hadn't met you, Takuto,

110
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,266
my life would've gone by
without me ever singing.

111
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,333
But we did meet, right?

112
00:08:37,866 --> 00:08:39,666
And I gave you the body
that allowed you to sing.

113
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,933
Continue singing
to the very end!

114
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:50,466
You wouldn't be the real you
if you didn't sing.

115
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:53,333
You'll definitely regret it
if you let that happen.

116
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,100
Like me.

117
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,166
You have regrets, Takuto?

118
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,766
Yeah. When I was a human,
I got a tumor in my throat just like you.

119
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:09,633
Takuto! You can't remember, Takuto!
You'll become a ghost!

120
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:12,633
I don't care.
I don't care what happens to me.

121
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Takuto!

122
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:18,533
If me remembering will make you
want to sing again, Mitsuki,

123
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:20,933
I will remember
everything for you.

124
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,100
For me?

125
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,066
I got a tumor in my throat
after Route L disbanded.

126
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:47,633
Even after I went solo,
I continued singing. But...

127
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:08,100
Eventually my symptoms worsened,
and I was no longer able to sing.

128
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,500
I was devastated.

129
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:18,666
If I had known that
this would happen,

130
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,066
I wish I had never known
what it was like to sing.

131
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:26,033
I wished I could run away to a world
where there was no music.

132
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,933
I went crazy and raced around blindly
trying to run away from everything.

133
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,000
<i>Where is this?</i>

134
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,566
<i>Jeez! What the heck is this?</i>

135
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:11,066
<i>You are Takuto, right?</i>

136
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:13,033
<i>Wh-Who the heck are you?</i>

137
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,733
<i>W-What do you think you're doing?!</i>
<i>Stop that—</i>

138
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,266
<i>Stop...</i>

139
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:26,900
<i>Your memory of the past</i>
<i>has just been sealed off.</i>

140
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:35,833
<i>Let's go, Death Spirit Takuto...</i>
<i>to a labyrinth of eternal punishment.</i>

141
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:45,333
I can't believe I died like that!
Why didn't I continue living to the end?!

142
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:52,433
I don't want you to have
regrets like I do, Mitsuki.

143
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,666
I don't care if I have regrets.

144
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,633
I made up my mind not to sing,
so I will never sing again.

145
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,600
Don't you get
what I'm saying yet?

146
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:02,733
You...

147
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:06,433
Takuto, what's the matter?

148
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:12,833
Takuto!

149
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,300
Don't tell me that his transformation
into a ghost has begun!

150
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,266
Please stop, Takuto! I beg you,
please don't remember anything more!

151
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:23,500
Meroko!

152
00:12:23,966 --> 00:12:25,633
Don't worry about me, Meroko.

153
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:28,833
I must remember.

154
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,566
There's more I need
to tell you, Mitsuki.

155
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:36,433
Takuto...

156
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,333
To give Mitsuki
the will to live, eh?

157
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:09,766
Mitsuki?!

158
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:17,266
Takuto!
Don't remember any more!

159
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,500
If you continue like this,
you'll really turn into a ghost!

160
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:24,466
No! Not until Mitsuki
changes her mind!

161
00:13:24,566 --> 00:13:27,033
Why?! Why are you
going to that extent?

162
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:29,033
Takuto!

163
00:13:30,866 --> 00:13:34,066
Perhaps it's due to the pain, but I'm
starting to remember more and more.

164
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,066
You must continue to sing
that song, "Eternal Snow."

165
00:13:40,466 --> 00:13:42,333
For Aoi and Hazuki.

166
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,966
For my Dad and Mom?

167
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:45,966
Yeah.

168
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:52,433
When I was a member of Route L,
I, the vocalist was still 12 years old.

169
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,266
The keyboard player
was Keichi Wakaoji.

170
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,400
The guitarist was
your father, Aoi Koga.

171
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,366
And Hazuki, your mother
was always with us.

172
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,500
<i>What a beautiful melody.</i>
<i>It sounds like you, Aoi.</i>

173
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:22,200
<i>I'm so glad you like it.</i>

174
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:24,300
<i>Huh?</i>

175
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,466
<i>To Hazuki with love.</i>

176
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:32,066
<i>You wrote this song for me?</i>

177
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,166
<i>Yes.</i>

178
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,866
<i>Takuto!</i>

179
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:41,933
<i>What is it, Keichi?</i>

180
00:14:51,566 --> 00:14:53,866
<i>It seems like a waste that</i>
<i>it's just for the music box.</i>

181
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:55,700
<i>We should give it some lyrics.</i>

182
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:58,833
<i>Sure. What kind of image</i>
<i>does it give you, Hazuki?</i>

183
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:00,533
<i>Let's see...</i>

184
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:04,533
<i>Eternal snow...</i>

185
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,033
<i>Snow that falls forever, huh?</i>

186
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:11,633
That's how the song, "Eternal Snow,"
came to be written.

187
00:15:12,866 --> 00:15:16,666
Since then, that song became
one of Route L's main songs.

188
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:20,833
That's probably because Aoi and
Hazuki's feelings communicated with us.

189
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:24,000
My dad and my mom's feelings...

190
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,966
Back then...

191
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,066
I wasn't able to
put it into words,

192
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,800
but some sort of hot feeling
welled up inside of me.

193
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,166
It was a very strange feeling.

194
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:37,300
You see?

195
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,766
You must continue to
communicate those feelings.

196
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:43,666
Songs aren't concrete things.

197
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:48,966
Unless you sing it,
that song won't exist anywhere.

198
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,766
But...still, it's...

199
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,333
For goodness sake!

200
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:58,100
Stop saying things that would
make Aoi and Hazuki sad!

201
00:15:58,466 --> 00:15:59,133
Huh?

202
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,500
The last time I saw Hazuki

203
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:05,233
was when the two of them
told me they were getting married.

204
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:08,033
<i>Really?!</i>

205
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:09,833
<i>Congratulations!</i>

206
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:10,733
<i>Thanks!</i>

207
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:12,566
<i>Look at this.</i>

208
00:16:13,266 --> 00:16:15,333
<i>I thought we could use</i>
<i>the characters meaning "full moon"</i>

209
00:16:15,366 --> 00:16:16,433
<i>and pronounce it "Mitsuki."</i>

210
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,900
<i>Mitsuki?</i>

211
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:20,400
<i>The name of our daughter.</i>

212
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:21,666
<i>Daughter?</i>

213
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:27,866
<i>I'm not sure it's a girl yet, but I want</i>
<i>to give her the name "Mitsuki."</i>

214
00:16:29,066 --> 00:16:33,500
<i>Even after the moon wanes,</i>
<i>it begins to shine and wax again, right?</i>

215
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:38,866
<i>I want my child to shine</i>
<i>forever just like the moon.</i>

216
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:46,400
To shine forever
just like the moon.

217
00:16:46,633 --> 00:16:49,133
Those were their hopes for you
as you were born into this world.

218
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:53,200
Not only Aoi and Hazuki,
but Eichi as well!

219
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:58,066
And all the people around you today...
We want you to live too!

220
00:16:58,233 --> 00:16:59,500
That's right, Mitsuki!

221
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,500
Please sing once again!
For everyone's sake!

222
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,833
No. For your own sake!

223
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
<i>So you should just be</i>
<i>true to yourself, Mitsuki.</i>

224
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,933
<i>Because we'll all</i>
<i>make you shine.</i>

225
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,633
<i>I have given</i>
<i>a great deal of thought</i>

226
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,600
<i>to your request that</i>
<i>I produce Mitsuki's song.</i>

227
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,533
<i>I will agree on</i>
<i>certain conditions.</i>

228
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,766
<i>We'll do our best together forever!</i>
<i>Okay, Mitsuki?</i>

229
00:17:28,633 --> 00:17:33,466
<i>No!</i>
<i>I-I don't want you to die!</i>

230
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:36,100
<i>Please, just come back!</i>

231
00:17:36,766 --> 00:17:37,866
<i>Mitsuki!</i>

232
00:17:59,466 --> 00:18:00,833
For my own sake...

233
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:04,600
Be true to myself.

234
00:18:05,433 --> 00:18:08,600
You have to return to how you
were when you were happy.

235
00:18:15,633 --> 00:18:17,700
<i>I have so much desire</i>
<i>to sing right now,</i>

236
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:19,366
<i>I feel like my chest is</i>
<i>going to burst open!</i>

237
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,933
<i>I want to warm people's</i>
<i>hearts with music!</i>

238
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,100
<i>You're really good at singing,</i>
<i>aren't you, Mitsuki?</i>

239
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:38,833
Mitsuki, sing!

240
00:18:39,433 --> 00:18:45,433
You know, they say live music,
don't they? L-I-V-E, live.

241
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:50,466
To those who have encountered music,
to live is to sing.

242
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,800
To sing is to live.

243
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:04,066
<i>With that, I have told her everything</i>
<i>I needed to tell her.</i>

244
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:11,100
No!

245
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:16,533
No! You can't
become a ghost!

246
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,433
What should I do?!

247
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,233
What do I need to do so that you
don't become a ghost, Takuto?

248
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,800
Stop, Meroko.

249
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,833
No! If you're going to become a ghost,
Takuto, I will go with you!

250
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:28,533
Idiot...

251
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Takuto...

252
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,733
Mitsuki!

253
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,700
Mrs. Koyama!

254
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:41,300
Takuto!

255
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:51,733
How long has it been since
I fell in love with you?

256
00:19:52,733 --> 00:20:01,133
My feelings keep
getting stronger.

257
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:07,100
- Mrs. Koyama! Have you come to?
- I wonder if

258
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:11,333
- Mitsuki... That song is...
- you can notice them?

259
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,033
- W-Wait a minute. Please let her sing.
- Even though I've

260
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:20,100
- Those are Mitsuki's true feelings.
- never mentioned it.

261
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,300
- I want to listen to her too.
- They're silent like the snow,

262
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,400
- This is the first time
- but they keep

263
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:30,300
- I've ever heard her sing.
- building up.

264
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,100
Please forgive me, Hazuki... Aoi...

265
00:20:37,966 --> 00:20:41,433
I will take care
of your daughter.

266
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:46,766
Hold me tight.

267
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,066
Takuto...
I'm so glad.

268
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,066
- Yeah.
- If loving someone was

269
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,400
going to feel like this,

270
00:20:59,433 --> 00:21:02,933
I wish I never
found out about love.

271
00:21:02,966 --> 00:21:11,633
I love you.
My tears won't stop.

272
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:16,933
- If this is how it's going to be,
<i>- Everyone is supporting me.</i>

273
00:21:16,966 --> 00:21:21,633
- I wish I had never met you.
<i>- Everyone is making me shine.</i>

274
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,766
<i>So I'll continue to sing.</i>

275
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:30,700
<i>Just like the moon that waxes</i>
<i>and shines even after it wanes.</i>

276
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,200
I'm sorry. I don't know what
came over me to ask Izumi.

277
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,200
It's fine.
You don't have to say anything.

278
00:23:28,766 --> 00:23:30,866
Takuto, thank you!

279
00:23:31,366 --> 00:23:33,733
Hey, it's no time to be down.

280
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:37,366
We have the important
task of protecting her!

281
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,666
Yeah!

282
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,333
Next time on Full Moon:
"The Hope to Live."

283
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,800
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
