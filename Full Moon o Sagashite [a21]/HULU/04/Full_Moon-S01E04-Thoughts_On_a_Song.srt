1
00:00:05,966 --> 00:00:09,300
Meet Mitsuki Koyama, 12 years old.
Her dream is to become a singer.

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,066
But, poor thing,
she only has one year to live.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,766
Her manager's been assigned to her,

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,966
and she came by to meet Mitsuki,
and Dr. Wakaoji!

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,233
We had quite a time trying
to keep her true identity a secret!

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,033
But thanks to my efforts,

7
00:00:22,066 --> 00:00:24,700
we got through it successfully!

8
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:28,200
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

9
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:33,966
Got that?

10
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:34,933
Yes.

11
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,366
This embarrassing behavior
must stop, Mitsuki.

12
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:20,500
All through the meal,
you kept minding your skirt...

13
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,700
When you sit down to dinner,
you must...

14
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,700
What's that?

15
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:27,900
I-It's nothing.

16
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,800
I'm sorry.
I'll be careful from now on.

17
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:31,800
Good night.

18
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,200
Wait a minute...

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,166
I'm not done talking to you!

20
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:39,400
She didn't let me finish!

21
00:02:41,766 --> 00:02:43,866
Phew! That was close!

22
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:47,333
H-Hello...

23
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:49,433
<i>Oh, Mitsuki? It's Oshige.</i>

24
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:50,933
Ms. Oshige!

25
00:02:51,066 --> 00:02:52,000
<i>I know this is sudden,</i>

26
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:54,066
<i>but we're going to
release your debut single.</i>

27
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:55,066
What?

28
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,733
What? Debut?!

29
00:02:57,766 --> 00:03:02,833
<i>Thoughts on a Song</i>

30
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:11,633
Mitsuki, this is Mr. Takasu,
the executive producer.

31
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:14,333
I'm Mitsuki Koyama,
it's very nice to meet you.

32
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:17,966
The theme for your debut single is
"a cool Lolita's dynamite love."

33
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,833
Um, can you repeat that
for me one more time.

34
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:23,933
Oh, if you're talking about that,
just do as I instructed you

35
00:03:23,966 --> 00:03:25,400
and there should be no problem.

36
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Oh, don't worry.

37
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:30,766
I've already told them to

38
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,933
make the costumes and
choreography very sexy.

39
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:36,300
S-Sexy?

40
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,466
Oh, you sent it? Okay!

41
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:44,800
And these are the lyrics
for your debut single

42
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,600
that the lyricist just sent.

43
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,000
Love...Me...Do?

44
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:53,833
"Love Me Do Forever."

45
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:55,966
You're a high school student, right?

46
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:57,466
Weak in English, huh?

47
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,400
Oh, yes. I'm sorry.

48
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:07,200
"The kiss of seduction...has them both in a
Non-stop Love Hurricane"?!

49
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:09,133
In any case,

50
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,400
we should just concentrate
on your debut process...

51
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:12,766
- Um...
- Huh?

52
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,400
Am I going to be singing this?

53
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,200
Do you have a problem with it?

54
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:20,733
Well, not a problem, but...

55
00:04:20,866 --> 00:04:21,933
This is...

56
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,333
E-Excuse us for a second.

57
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,400
Mitsuki, what are you thinking?!

58
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,300
You have to look happier!

59
00:04:32,466 --> 00:04:35,133
Mr. Takasu is the producer
for those wildly popular singers

60
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:39,133
like Genki Matsushita
and Rika Kobayashi!

61
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:40,666
I know...

62
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,800
But with that song,
Eichi won't understand.

63
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:45,800
Eichi?

64
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,366
Then, why don't you try writing
the lyrics yourself?

65
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:53,300
You want to put your feelings
into the lyrics, right?

66
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,566
Then the only way is
to write it yourself.

67
00:04:57,266 --> 00:04:59,600
My feelings into the lyrics?

68
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,000
Why don't you try writing it
if you can?

69
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:08,433
Mitsuki, thank him and
say you'll go with his lyrics.

70
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,466
Newbies these days are so cocky!

71
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:14,133
Well, now that you understand,
it's okay.

72
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:16,133
I'll write it myself!

73
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,200
Huh?

74
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:19,166
You're exactly right.

75
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,400
I'll put my feelings into the lyrics.

76
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:23,700
Thank you so much for you advice.

77
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,433
Th-That wasn't advice.

78
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:28,366
What?! That's no good...

79
00:05:29,366 --> 00:05:31,133
All right.
I'm coming over now.

80
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,266
Well, this will be
pretty interesting.

81
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:37,433
But you only have three days.

82
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,133
Let's see what a total amateur can do...

83
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,866
in three days.

84
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:46,933
I-I'm so sorry!

85
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,333
Mitsuki?

86
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:53,366
Yes...

87
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:57,366
I want to make sure of
something as your manager.

88
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,366
Y-Yes...

89
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,533
Can you tell me
about this Eichi?

90
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:08,466
So there is someone special
in your life.

91
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,266
Yes...

92
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:13,166
But he went to America,
and I have no way of contacting him.

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,866
I thought of becoming a singer
in the hopes that

94
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,733
he could be listening to my song
and realize that it's me.

95
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:22,933
All right!

96
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,766
If that's the case,
I'll support you.

97
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,866
Really?

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,200
Yes. Besides, there was nothing good
about that song.

99
00:06:32,366 --> 00:06:34,500
But his songs sell, right?

100
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:37,500
Just because it sells doesn't
mean that it's a great song.

101
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,166
I want you to be able to debut
with a great song.

102
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:44,533
Miss Oshige...

103
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:48,333
Write beautiful lyrics and
let's show that Producer Takasu.

104
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,266
Yes!

105
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:57,633
Now, let's write!

106
00:07:03,366 --> 00:07:05,500
What's the matter,
hurry up and write.

107
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,266
I want to, but...

108
00:07:07,466 --> 00:07:10,100
How do I write lyrics?

109
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,800
Don't tell me that
you don't know how?

110
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,633
Nope.

111
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,933
Then why did you say that
you would write the lyrics?!

112
00:07:16,966 --> 00:07:17,800
Well...

113
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:19,366
You get into these situations because

114
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,533
you get excited and
don't think before you speak!

115
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,233
What do I do?
I only have three days.

116
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,400
Leave this to me...

117
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,866
Do you have any CDs
or song books?

118
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,466
Sure. Hold on.

119
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,233
You always leave it there?

120
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,733
Yeah, if it's found,
it would get thrown away.

121
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:42,666
Here.

122
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,166
It's really old and frayed.

123
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:47,200
Yeah...

124
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,733
This is the only thing I have left
that relates to music.

125
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,333
I cherished it and
read it a lot.

126
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:58,700
You really are sweet.

127
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,433
By the way, Meroko...

128
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:02,333
what're you going to do
with that beat-up lyric book?

129
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,800
Well...

130
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:06,733
What?!

131
00:08:06,766 --> 00:08:09,933
H-Hey! Meroko!
What are you doing?!

132
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:13,766
I have no idea
what you're saying!

133
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:16,266
Look!

134
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,366
Let go of...

135
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,266
my hand!

136
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,333
That was a hint.

137
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:22,166
What?

138
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:24,366
Now guess what it is?

139
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:26,000
What are you talking about?

140
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,800
You just bit my hand!

141
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,700
Exactly! I'm going to take
a bite off of it!

142
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:33,966
But, won't we get in
trouble for plagiarizing...

143
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:35,900
Of course we would!

144
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,500
Don't worry!

145
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,500
I'm just going to use
her favorite songs as reference.

146
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,966
I wonder...

147
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:45,766
Just do as you want!

148
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,000
Uh?!

149
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,700
W-What now?!

150
00:08:56,366 --> 00:08:59,933
Now Takuto will be totally
in love with Meroko.

151
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:04,600
Geez, she said to
leave the lyrics to her,

152
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:06,033
but I'm so fed up with this...

153
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:06,833
Huh?

154
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,600
<i>Mitsuki...</i>

155
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,633
Oh well,
I guess it can't be helped.

156
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:50,833
You're up early...

157
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:52,733
Oh, Takuto...

158
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:54,166
Good morning...

159
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:55,433
Yeah...

160
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,833
Say, are you okay?
You were up pretty late.

161
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,866
Yeah, I think I'm okay.

162
00:10:01,966 --> 00:10:04,166
I totally forgot about
my illness too...

163
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,700
You forgot...

164
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:08,500
This is the first time ever that
I got so focused

165
00:10:08,533 --> 00:10:10,033
that I forgot about my sickness.

166
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:14,600
It feels really good to put
everything into something you love.

167
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,000
And...

168
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,200
This was from you...

169
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:20,100
wasn't it?

170
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,133
That's why I'm okay.

171
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,866
Thanks.

172
00:10:27,033 --> 00:10:29,300
Never mind that.
Were you able to write the lyrics?

173
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,733
Yeah, I was able to but...

174
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,433
Let's see...

175
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,833
Meroko...

176
00:10:39,466 --> 00:10:41,233
W-What do you think?

177
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,166
I-I don't know what to say...

178
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,466
Well then, I'll look at it.

179
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:49,733
<i>When you laugh,</i>

180
00:10:49,766 --> 00:10:51,800
<i>my heart turns into
a sunshine mark,</i>

181
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,866
<i>If you cry,
it turns into a flood.</i>

182
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:57,300
<i>Always be next to me, smiling!
Peace!</i>

183
00:10:57,633 --> 00:10:58,666
What is this?

184
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,433
No good, huh?

185
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:02,333
I-I didn't say that
it wasn't any good...

186
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:03,133
Yeah!

187
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,800
The first draft is
always a bit rough.

188
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:08,166
It's okay.
I realize that it's really bad.

189
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:10,833
But I've never experienced
these things,

190
00:11:10,866 --> 00:11:12,866
so I can't really imagine
what it's like.

191
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:14,233
Then!

192
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:15,766
Why don't you
go on a date?

193
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,566
What?!

194
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,866
Then, you should be able
to write it, right?

195
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,400
But how?

196
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,200
I don't even have anyone
to go on a date with.

197
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:23,433
Oh...right...

198
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:28,100
I thought
it was a good idea.

199
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,000
Good morning, Mitsuki!

200
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:34,800
How are you
feeling this morning?

201
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:36,200
Oh!

202
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:39,766
There's that someone...
you can date!

203
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,466
What, a date with Dr. Wakaoji?!

204
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:43,433
Huh?

205
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:05,833
Wow! I've always wanted
to go to Harajuku.

206
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:09,666
It makes me glad to see
you so happy.

207
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,700
I never would have thought
that you'd ask me out on a date.

208
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:18,233
Well, if you're this energetic,
I'm sure your body can take it.

209
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:18,866
Yes!

210
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,466
All right then.
It's the start of our date.

211
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,800
Yes!

212
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,766
Wow! This is so good.

213
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,433
Isn't it?
I thought that you'd like it.

214
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:45,733
As expected, he's quite used
to taking girls around...

215
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,600
Huh, he's just showing off!

216
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,566
So how was the date?

217
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:51,800
Will it help with your work?

218
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:54,300
Yes, it was a lot of fun.

219
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,666
It seemed like I was
on a date with Eichi...

220
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,700
Oh!

221
00:13:00,966 --> 00:13:05,466
No wonder you seemed
a little distracted. It was Eichi, huh?

222
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,333
Eichi, Eichi...

223
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,733
You're so cute!

224
00:13:10,766 --> 00:13:11,700
Not really?

225
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:14,533
Well...it's about time.

226
00:13:14,966 --> 00:13:16,233
Let's head home, shall we?

227
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,133
Yes.

228
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,733
Mitsuki!

229
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:24,766
Are you okay, Mitsuki?

230
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,733
Yes... I'm okay.

231
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:29,900
Mitsuki!

232
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,733
Mitsuki, hang on now.

233
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:34,433
Mitsuki!

234
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,066
It seems like
the medication is working.

235
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:45,133
Your fever has gone down and
your coughing has stopped.

236
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,300
I'm sorry, it's because
I insisted on this.

237
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,633
No, it was my fault for being lax.

238
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:53,000
No, that's not it!

239
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,466
It was because
I stayed up late last night.

240
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,400
Stayed up late?

241
00:13:56,766 --> 00:13:59,366
Don't tell me that
was for work, too?

242
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,100
I did say that I'd help you.

243
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,233
But if you're going to push
yourself so much,

244
00:14:06,266 --> 00:14:09,666
then I'm going to have to
stop your modelling job.

245
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,366
Doctor, please not that!

246
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,533
I want to make my debut
at any cost.

247
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,066
I have to debut and let Eichi
know that I'm here.

248
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,033
If I don't, I...I...

249
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:25,633
- I get it.
- Huh?

250
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:27,966
You're so determined,

251
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,566
I think you'll get worse
if I stop you.

252
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,233
No need to worry,

253
00:14:32,266 --> 00:14:34,066
I'm still going to support you
on this.

254
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,600
Really?

255
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:36,700
Yes.

256
00:14:36,966 --> 00:14:39,266
But really, you can't
push yourself too much.

257
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:40,100
Yes!

258
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,833
Eichi again?

259
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,166
Eichi is so lucky to have someone
who cares that much about him.

260
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:48,033
It's just like how much
I love you, Takuto!

261
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:49,766
G-Get off of me!

262
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:53,166
I'll be on my way.

263
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,300
What are you doing?

264
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,200
The medicine is working,
so I thought I'd...

265
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:07,466
No, you should be sleeping.

266
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,400
I can't sleep.

267
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,233
I only have one more day
until I turn in the lyrics...

268
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,400
Hey Takuto, make me
a 16-year-old again.

269
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:19,766
Then I wouldn't have
to worry about my body.

270
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:21,666
You're right, but...

271
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,900
Why do you have to
push yourself so hard?

272
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,400
It'll be all right, wouldn't it...

273
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:28,533
if you use the song
that Producer Takasu composed?

274
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:30,866
It's supposed to be a hit, isn't it?

275
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:33,766
No, it can't just be a hit.

276
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,466
My feelings have
to reach Eichi.

277
00:15:39,566 --> 00:15:41,600
Well, I've had it!

278
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:43,833
Takuto?

279
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,300
You can forget about my support.

280
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,033
What do you mean?

281
00:15:48,266 --> 00:15:49,633
Just give it up!

282
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,466
It was impossible for you
to write the lyrics to begin with.

283
00:15:53,466 --> 00:15:56,733
H-Hey wait, Takuto!

284
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,366
Takuto! Takuto!

285
00:16:04,066 --> 00:16:05,533
<i>I can't talk!</i>

286
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:08,700
<i>If I don't have Takuto, then I'm...</i>

287
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,900
<i>I'll never be able to...</i>

288
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,300
What do I do?

289
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:23,233
<i>Geez, who does she think she is?</i>

290
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:26,933
<i>Every single sentence she utters
is about Eichi this and Eichi that...</i>

291
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:29,000
<i>I'm so sick of it!</i>

292
00:16:32,266 --> 00:16:33,966
Takuto! Wait!

293
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:36,533
Wait!

294
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,033
What's wrong with you?!
Saying such things to her?

295
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,566
Why are you stopping all
of a sudden!

296
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,366
Meroko...

297
00:16:46,566 --> 00:16:47,433
Huh?...

298
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,000
Seems like they're arguing.

299
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:54,900
Let's go.

300
00:16:54,933 --> 00:16:56,666
Oh, yeah...

301
00:16:58,433 --> 00:16:59,533
What do you mean by that!

302
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,100
What do you mean that
the song is already finished!

303
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,866
Just as I said, I'm not going to
change her song for her debut.

304
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:11,633
But you promised to wait for
Mitsuki to write the lyrics!

305
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,166
Do you have any idea of
what it's going to cost us

306
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,966
if we fail on this project?

307
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:20,600
Will you take full responsibility for
leaving it up to a total amateur?

308
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,100
W-Well...

309
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,733
A promise is a promise.

310
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,466
So naïve...

311
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,366
You won't be able to survive
with that kind of thinking.

312
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,200
Serves him right!

313
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,266
You totally deserve it!

314
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:40,066
You can't even start to understand
what Mitsuki is feeling!

315
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,700
<i>That's right!</i>

316
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:44,500
<i>You have no idea how important
a promise is to her!</i>

317
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:52,166
<i>I should have known better,
yet I said such a horrible thing!</i>

318
00:17:52,566 --> 00:17:53,600
I'm going home!

319
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,733
Hey!

320
00:17:54,766 --> 00:17:56,766
Oh! What's going on?!

321
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:10,766
Mitsuki...

322
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,700
Earlier, I...

323
00:18:13,433 --> 00:18:16,800
Hurry up and apologize!

324
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:17,866
Yeah...

325
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,166
Earlier, I!

326
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Takuto?

327
00:18:23,233 --> 00:18:23,966
Huh?!

328
00:18:25,066 --> 00:18:26,700
What? Then this?!

329
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,900
I curled up this blanket
so I could fool Grandma

330
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:33,000
in case she came to check up on me
while I was working on the lyrics.

331
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,866
Oh...boy!

332
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,833
Takuto, I'm sorry about earlier...

333
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:41,266
No! That's my line.

334
00:18:41,733 --> 00:18:45,566
I rely on you and
Meroko for everything.

335
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:50,733
Debuting and seeing Eichi again
are my dreams...

336
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,233
I'm pitiful for not
putting my own effort into it.

337
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,566
So you kept on writing?

338
00:18:59,966 --> 00:19:03,200
Yeah...I wasted a lot of paper.

339
00:19:03,866 --> 00:19:07,600
But it was fun thinking
about what I wanted to write.

340
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:08,433
Huh?

341
00:19:08,933 --> 00:19:10,933
I realized that
I love singing, after all!

342
00:19:13,533 --> 00:19:16,266
Earlier I thought that I would
never sing again,

343
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,033
and I got sad and depressed...

344
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:23,300
I do want to see Eichi,

345
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:26,233
but my desire to sing is
just as strong.

346
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,200
This feeling,
it's so powerful...

347
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,500
I can't stop it!

348
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:34,100
That's it!

349
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:36,366
What? What do you mean "that's it"?

350
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:41,400
Put those feelings that you
just spoke of into lyrics.

351
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:44,266
My feelings into the lyrics?

352
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,033
Yeah.

353
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:47,366
But I wonder if I can
get my feelings across?

354
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,333
I totally got it.

355
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,300
What?

356
00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:52,266
Me too.

357
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,300
Okay! I'll try it.

358
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,833
That's the spirit!

359
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:01,066
Do your best.

360
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,233
Yes!

361
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:10,566
This is the best that I can do.

362
00:20:10,933 --> 00:20:12,366
I hope this will be sufficient.

363
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:15,033
Well, I'll take it, just in case.

364
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,233
I guess it can't be helped!

365
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:26,900
Huh?

366
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,433
Oh, it's me Takasu.

367
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:31,900
Tell the writer that

368
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:34,233
we're going with different lyrics
for Mitsuki Koyama's song.

369
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,033
What?!

370
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:35,966
Does that mean?

371
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:37,166
I lose.

372
00:20:37,266 --> 00:20:39,033
Now that you've written
these great lyrics...

373
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:42,000
we'll have to change the concept
and wardrobe all together.

374
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,066
Then...

375
00:20:43,266 --> 00:20:46,933
You did it!
They're going to use your lyrics!

376
00:20:47,066 --> 00:20:48,833
What?! Is that true?

377
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,533
Yeah. We're already tight
on our schedule,

378
00:20:51,566 --> 00:20:53,266
and thanks to you,
it's all messed up now.

379
00:20:53,433 --> 00:20:56,500
You better be prepared,
it's going to get busy.

380
00:20:56,566 --> 00:20:58,233
Yes! We'll do our best!

381
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,966
By the way, what about
your stage name?

382
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:01,733
Huh?

383
00:21:01,766 --> 00:21:04,966
That's right. Do you want to use
your real name?

384
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,066
N-No, that wouldn't be good.

385
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:12,133
<i>Hey Mitsuki...</i>

386
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:17,533
<i>There's no need to worry
if we ever get separated.</i>

387
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,266
<i>Why?</i>

388
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,200
<i>No matter where you are on earth,</i>

389
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:24,100
<i>you're always able to
see the moon in the sky.</i>

390
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:28,200
<i>So I'll look up in the sky
to look for the moon.</i>

391
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,233
<i>So Mitsuki, you have to shine
even more than now,</i>

392
00:21:31,566 --> 00:21:34,000
<i>so I can find you right away.</i>

393
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,366
I've decided...

394
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:44,400
I'll go with Full Moon.

395
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,566
Yodel lay ehooo!

396
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,933
What was that all about?

397
00:23:21,966 --> 00:23:23,100
Takuto, look! Look!

398
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:26,266
This view...
This blue sky, the green mountains...

399
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,000
the fresh air tastes soooo good!

400
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,466
We're not here to play!

401
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,300
It's her first assignment,

402
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:32,833
so we have to keep
an eye on things.

403
00:23:32,866 --> 00:23:36,166
I know!
But can she really do it?

404
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,233
Well...
she is a 12-year-old inside...

405
00:23:40,866 --> 00:23:44,000
Next time on Full Moon:
"Her First Assignment!"

406
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,433
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
