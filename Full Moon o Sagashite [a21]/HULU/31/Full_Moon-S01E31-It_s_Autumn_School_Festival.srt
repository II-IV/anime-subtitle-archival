1
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:08,566
Mitsuki has an unexpected
visitor from America.

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:14,233
It's Ms. Kazumi, who took care of Mitsuki
before she started living here.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,000
Upon talking with Mitsuki,

4
00:00:17,033 --> 00:00:20,500
Ms. Kazumi promises to find
Eichi's whereabouts in America!

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,333
Isn't that great?
Now one of her dreams may come true!

6
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,933
So, I wonder what's
going to happen today...

7
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:33,666
Got that?

8
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:34,700
Yes.

9
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:14,500
A live show at this university's
school festival, eh?

10
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:16,066
Sounds like fun!

11
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:17,033
Yeah, really!

12
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:20,033
Besides, I can't believe that
these beautiful buildings are a school!

13
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,900
It's so different from elementary schools.

14
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,066
Oh, they even have a planetarium.
How wonderful!

15
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:27,833
Yeah.

16
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:29,900
A planetarium...

17
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,833
Thinking about Eichi again?

18
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:41,266
Huh? Y-Yeah

19
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,900
In any case, planetariums are so nice.
I want to go there with Takuto.

20
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:54,600
Jeez, I can't take this anymore!

21
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,166
Wow.

22
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,233
There are little shops too.
It's a pretty serious deal!

23
00:03:21,466 --> 00:03:24,300
No! I said I am going!

24
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:28,100
Hey, listen!
We are not here to play around!

25
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:30,200
Just for a little bit!

26
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:34,666
I'll give you some apricot candy
if I win some!

27
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:37,400
I prefer plums!

28
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,600
Anyway, that's not the point!
Come on, let's go!

29
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,266
What's happening?
Are they having another dispute?

30
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,166
Yes. Seems like Meroko
wants to go to the booths.

31
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,000
Meroko, let's all go together
when we have more time later! Okay?

32
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Okay.

33
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:02,233
You have...

34
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:03,433
...a favor to ask?

35
00:04:03,466 --> 00:04:09,500
Yes. For the live show in the evening,
you perform after Scanty.

36
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,733
But before the show,
we have an event in which

37
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:17,266
we would like Full Moon to make
a guest appearance as a princess.

38
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,533
I'm sorry, but it's too sudden.

39
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:24,333
We heard that it would be a live show,
and we've planned accordingly for that.

40
00:04:24,466 --> 00:04:26,566
But could you...
Please...

41
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:27,966
But...

42
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:34,000
A role of a princess? Sounds like fun!
Ms. Oshige, I want to do it!

43
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:34,900
What?

44
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:39,866
Well... If you really want to do it,
Mitsuki, I won't say no.

45
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,700
So that's okay?!
Thank you so much!

46
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:43,800
All right!

47
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,066
Hold on one second!

48
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,466
I didn't say okay yet!

49
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,366
Well, I guess that's that,
so shall we go somewhere till it's time?

50
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,300
Wow, I thought we were going out
when you said we'd go somewhere.

51
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:06,833
But universities have everything.

52
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:10,500
Yes. It's very different
from your school, isn't it?

53
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:11,200
Yes.

54
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:20,033
Oh, looks like in universities,
classes are called lectures!

55
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:22,500
And they are 90 minutes long!

56
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:25,100
On top of that, there are so many
courses that I have never heard of!

57
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:26,433
Let's see...

58
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:31,133
Quantum Mechanics, Psychoacoustics,
Ergonomics, and Cultural Anthropology?

59
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:34,566
They sound so difficult,
it's making me dizzy.

60
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:36,966
But I know that one.

61
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:39,233
Huh? Astronomy?

62
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:43,633
Oh, that's right!
Eichi was studying astronomy, right?

63
00:05:43,766 --> 00:05:44,433
Yes!

64
00:05:44,466 --> 00:05:45,866
Not Eichi again!

65
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:49,533
Oh? You got jealous just now,
didn't you?

66
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:51,566
What?! No I didn't!

67
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,500
See! You're getting defensive!
I was right, wasn't I?

68
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,266
No!

69
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,466
How dare you,
when you have someone like me.

70
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:58,700
How vexing!

71
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,366
Takuto, you are a cheater!

72
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,566
Huh?!

73
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,300
Fine, if that's the case...

74
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:06,700
I am going to enter this!

75
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,166
I'm going to be in it, and make you realize
how attractive Miss Meroko really is!

76
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
You've gotta be kidding.

77
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:15,966
I'm going to win!
And then, and then...

78
00:06:20,766 --> 00:06:23,500
<i>Meroko, I didn't realize</i>
<i>how attractive you were.</i>

79
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,933
<i>I... I...</i>

80
00:06:25,966 --> 00:06:28,700
<i>That's okay, Takuto.</i>
<i>Now you understand.</i>

81
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,466
<i>- Meroko...</i>
<i>- Takuto...</i>

82
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,500
All right!
Just you wait, Takuto!

83
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:37,500
Oh! Meroko!
Where are you going?!

84
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:38,733
Jeez...

85
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:41,466
Man, what an idiot.
Just let her be.

86
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,866
- Nice pose!
- Nice pose!

87
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:58,166
Don't you want to...

88
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,133
...give us your autograph...

89
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,533
- ...on our biceps?
- ...on our biceps?

90
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:07,866
Run, Mitsuki!

91
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:08,633
Huh?

92
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:09,833
Just hurry!

93
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
- Don't be so shy!
- Don't be so shy!

94
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,566
Stop right there!

95
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,166
I spent two years as a popstar and have
ten years of experience as a manager.

96
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:24,333
I, Masami Oshige, who has lived through
this shrewd world of showbiz, won't let—

97
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:27,466
you pass!

98
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,600
Takuto, I can't run anymore!

99
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:40,633
Keep going towards that elevator!

100
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:47,766
Mitsuki!

101
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:51,733
- Give us your autograph!
- Give us your autograph!

102
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,666
- Full Moon!
- Full Moon!

103
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:04,633
Ouch!

104
00:08:05,766 --> 00:08:07,966
Stop following Full Moon!

105
00:08:08,566 --> 00:08:09,800
- O-Out of the blue...
- O-Out of the blue...

106
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,333
- Who the heck are you?!
- Who the heck are you?!

107
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:16,133
I'm Full Moon's bodyguard!

108
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,300
<i>What? They can see Takuto?</i>

109
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,233
A bodyguard, huh?

110
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:24,500
Do you wanna fight against us?

111
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:30,233
Takuto...

112
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:32,433
What should we do?

113
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:41,933
- I-It was unopened!
- I-It was unopened!

114
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:45,066
What fight are you talking about?

115
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,966
We can handle empty cans.

116
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,066
But an unopened one...

117
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,366
- It's such a waste!
- It's such a waste!

118
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,266
Uh... Well...
You're running away for the wrong reason.

119
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,066
What?

120
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,166
Takuto, you can transform into a human!
That's amazing!

121
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:15,666
Oh, this?
If I concentrate, I can.

122
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,933
But I spend so much energy to do it
that I can't use any of my other powers.

123
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:25,366
But Takuto, you were like
a real bodyguard back there.

124
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,500
You were so cool!

125
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:27,300
Wha—;?!

126
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:28,300
Thanks!

127
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:29,933
S-Sure.

128
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,500
Takuto, why don't we
go play for just a bit?

129
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:40,433
No! What if there are more weirdos?!

130
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:45,500
It'll be fine since you'll be with me.
Right?

131
00:09:45,866 --> 00:09:46,533
Wha—;?!

132
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,666
Come on, let's just go for a while!

133
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,000
Hey!

134
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:15,733
Hey, hey...

135
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,500
Doesn't this feel like a date?

136
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:27,366
Sexy!

137
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:30,733
Look this way!

138
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:36,933
Oh, how stupid.

139
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,366
Come on, didn't you wanna
go to the planetarium?

140
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:42,533
Huh? Oh! Wait up, Takuto!

141
00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:53,466
- Wow...
- Wow...

142
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:58,033
There are so many!
It's beautiful!

143
00:10:58,233 --> 00:11:00,300
Yeah! There are too many stars,

144
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,500
I can't tell which ones
are which constellation.

145
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,966
Yeah! Eichi taught me so many of them
a long time ago, but I forgot them.

146
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,133
The sky I gazed at with Eichi
was so pretty.

147
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,000
B-But I know that one!
There!

148
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:18,333
Oh! The Big Dipper!

149
00:11:18,766 --> 00:11:19,433
Yeah.

150
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,000
The Big Dipper is shaped
like a dipper, right?

151
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,633
And, if that...

152
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,933
<i>If that had water in it,</i>
<i>I'm worried it would spill out.</i>

153
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:36,933
<i>Don't worry,</i>
<i>there's no water in it!</i>

154
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:40,800
<i>Oh! I see!</i>
<i>There are stars in it then!</i>

155
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:45,400
<i>And we see shooting stars when</i>
<i>it's filled so much it overflows?</i>

156
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:47,766
<i>You may be right.</i>

157
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,000
Now that I think about it,
I was saying strange things,

158
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:58,233
but Eichi never made fun of me,
and he always listened to me.

159
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:02,000
He was really so kind.
Eichi...

160
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:07,466
Hey, why are you walking away
before it's over?

161
00:12:07,566 --> 00:12:09,100
Are you upset about something?

162
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:13,133
Not really.
I just thought it's about time we go back.

163
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,566
Really?

164
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,333
Yeah.

165
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:20,066
You're lying!
You always get mad when I mention Eichi!

166
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:24,866
Well, if you think so,
then why did you talk about Eichi?

167
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,166
That's...

168
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:30,200
I don't know what to do
when you talk about those things!

169
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,633
Besides, I am not
a substitute for Eichi!

170
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,166
MISS FULL MOON'S
GREEN ROOM

171
00:12:59,066 --> 00:13:00,433
Oh no.

172
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,866
If I can't protect a talent,
I've failed at being a manager, haven't I?

173
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,100
Oh, sorry.

174
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,233
Only authorized people
can come in here.

175
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:14,300
What are you talking about, it's me.

176
00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:16,500
Huh? No... Well...

177
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:18,533
Takuto! Wait!

178
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:22,100
What? Y-You're Takuto?

179
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:23,266
Y-Yeah!

180
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,300
Oh? Umm... But...

181
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:30,900
Nice to meet you, I'm Oshige.

182
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,766
Oh, nice to meet you too, I'm Takuto.

183
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,533
Full Moon!

184
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:38,333
Please be ready soon!

185
00:13:38,966 --> 00:13:39,633
Yes!

186
00:13:42,966 --> 00:13:45,333
<i>Everyone!</i>
<i>Thank you for waiting!</i>

187
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:49,133
<i>It's time for our Nandai festival's famous</i>
<i>"Love Love Attack"!</i>

188
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:55,800
<i>And here is today's princess...</i>
<i>Full Moon!</i>

189
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:06,833
<i>Hi everyone, I'm Full Moon.</i>
<i>Thank you for having me today!</i>

190
00:14:08,566 --> 00:14:10,633
<i>Well, so, let's get started then!</i>

191
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:14,866
<i>Here are the candidates who will</i>
<i>compete to be Full Moon's knight.</i>

192
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:22,266
Looks like it's a pretty big deal.

193
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,300
Yeah...

194
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:25,333
I wonder if Mitsuki will be all right?

195
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:32,366
Those guys!
Why are they here?!

196
00:14:32,966 --> 00:14:37,666
<i>The lucky male students on stage</i>
<i>will participate in many different games</i>

197
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,066
<i>to contend for the princess!</i>

198
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,966
<i>The winner that remains</i>
<i>at the end of the game</i>

199
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,733
<i>will receive a kiss from Full Moon!</i>

200
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,466
What?

201
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:48,233
- All right!
- All right!

202
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,600
A kiss? I...

203
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:55,000
So we meet again!

204
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:56,400
Let's have fun!

205
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:58,033
S-Sure.

206
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,366
Hey, you!

207
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,333
You never mentioned
anything about a kiss!

208
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:05,133
Well, the presenter chooses
the prize on a whim.

209
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,433
It wasn't planned for.

210
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,233
What should we do, Takuto?

211
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:13,100
They might do something
weird to Mitsuki!

212
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:20,066
Takuto, please! Do something about this!
We can't stop the event now!

213
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,766
Please protect Mitsuki!

214
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:25,233
<i>I am not a substitute for Eichi!</i>

215
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,966
Hold it there!

216
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm participating too!

217
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,100
- What?!
- What?!

218
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
<i>Oh?!</i>

219
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:43,700
<i>A new contestant has jumped in!</i>
<i>This is unheard of!</i>

220
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:46,133
<i>Will the committee okay it?</i>

221
00:15:46,266 --> 00:15:47,266
<i>Takuto!</i>

222
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,500
<i>Okay!</i>

223
00:15:49,566 --> 00:15:52,833
<i>This is getting fun!</i>
<i>Let's get it started then!</i>

224
00:15:52,866 --> 00:15:55,033
You're the bodyguard we saw!

225
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:59,466
You were talking so big,
but you're after the kiss prize too!

226
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:03,133
Shut up! I'll never let
omeone like you win this!

227
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,666
<i>The first battle is</i>
<i>"Super Spicy Attack"!</i>

228
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:10,366
<i>The first 10 people that finish</i>
<i>this super spicy hot pot</i>

229
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,200
<i>will be able to go on</i>
<i>to the next battle!</i>

230
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:14,466
<i>Now, get set.</i>

231
00:16:18,266 --> 00:16:21,366
<i>Crap, I can't eat hot things.</i>

232
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:27,866
<i>Damn!</i>

233
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:30,566
<i>Good luck, Takuto.</i>

234
00:16:36,466 --> 00:16:37,466
<i>Takuto...</i>

235
00:16:51,466 --> 00:16:54,500
<i>Time is up!</i>

236
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,166
H-Hot...

237
00:16:59,866 --> 00:17:02,366
I hate spicy things!

238
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,600
<i>This year's Campus Queen is...</i>

239
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,533
<i>Entry number three...</i>

240
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,333
<i>Miss Meroko!</i>

241
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,866
- Meroko!
- Meroko!

242
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:26,100
And now, a trophy will be given
to the winner, Miss Meroko!

243
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:28,300
Yay! Thank you!

244
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:35,800
Oh, that must be the event
they were talking about.

245
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:36,900
Huh?

246
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,366
Is that...Takuto?!

247
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,833
Why is he participating?
And he's even in his human form!

248
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,400
- Congratulations...
- That Takuto!

249
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,566
Umm... Hey!
Where are you going?!

250
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:53,766
It's an emergency!
I'll be back to pick it up!

251
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:54,966
See ya!

252
00:18:00,966 --> 00:18:02,633
<i>Time's up!</i>

253
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,966
<i>We now have the contestants</i>
<i>that will go on to the final round!</i>

254
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:10,733
All right!
Way to go Takuto!

255
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:15,033
<i>The final battle is</i>
<i>"Hold Your Breath in a Basin Attack"!</i>

256
00:18:15,633 --> 00:18:20,233
<i>Whoever keeps his head in the basin</i>
<i>the longest is the winner!</i>

257
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,700
I won't let you win!

258
00:18:22,866 --> 00:18:23,866
Shut up!

259
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,100
<i>Okay, get set.</i>

260
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,700
<i>All right, everyone has started now.</i>

261
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:35,200
<i>Who will be the one to get a kiss</i>
<i>from the beautiful princess?!</i>

262
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,366
<i>I can't lose!</i>

263
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,566
<i>A kiss if I win!</i>
<i>A kiss if I win!</i>

264
00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:49,466
<i>A silent battle of men.</i>

265
00:18:49,633 --> 00:18:52,533
<i>And watching over them,</i>
<i>we have Princess Full Moon!</i>

266
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,000
<i>Who could her gaze be on?!</i>

267
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,300
<i>Takuto...</i>

268
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:08,166
<i>I made him so upset then.</i>
<i>I'm sorry Takuto.</i>

269
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Takuto...

270
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:13,866
<i>It's starting to get tough!</i>

271
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,766
<i>Oh? Looks like we have contestants</i>
<i>dropping out one after the other!</i>

272
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,633
Go Takuto!

273
00:19:23,766 --> 00:19:27,233
You won't die even if you don't
breathe for two or three hours!

274
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:30,033
- Go!
- P-Please calm down!

275
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,966
<i>Now we have</i>
<i>two contestants left.</i>

276
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,000
<i>Who will be the winner</i>
<i>of the victorious crown?!</i>

277
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,433
<i>A kiss if I win!</i>
<i>Just win!</i>

278
00:19:37,633 --> 00:19:39,433
<i>Now we are in</i>
<i>the most crucial moment!</i>

279
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:42,866
<i>Judgment will finally be</i>
<i>passed on the two of them!</i>

280
00:20:03,133 --> 00:20:05,966
I should have trained my lungs too.

281
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,266
<i>We have a knight!</i>

282
00:20:08,566 --> 00:20:11,433
<i>The winner is this one that</i>
<i>jumped into the game, Takuto!</i>

283
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,100
Huh? Me?

284
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:17,533
Yay! Awesome, Takuto!

285
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,300
<i>Now, Full Moon will</i>
<i>kiss the knight!</i>

286
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:27,200
Huh? Um...

287
00:20:27,766 --> 00:20:30,900
Hey, you two!
How hot and heavy!

288
00:20:30,933 --> 00:20:32,100
Ms. Oshige...

289
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:33,633
W-Well, I guess we
just have to do it.

290
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,800
Just do it on my forehead
and get it over with.

291
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,166
O-Okay.

292
00:20:47,066 --> 00:20:48,533
Just hold it there!

293
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:52,800
How dare you,
when you have a girl like me!

294
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,433
You cheater!

295
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:55,833
<i>Oh my!</i>

296
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:57,533
<i>We have an unexpected</i>
<i>development here!</i>

297
00:20:57,766 --> 00:21:02,400
<i>Looks like this year's knight and</i>
<i>this year's Campus Queen were lovers!</i>

298
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:03,333
No!

299
00:21:03,366 --> 00:21:07,000
Yes! Takuto and I are so in love!

300
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:07,700
What?!

301
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,633
If you want a kiss,
I'll give you one!

302
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:13,866
Cut it out, you dummy!

303
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,466
You are so shy,
don't run away like that!

304
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,966
Help me!

305
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,466
Takuto!

306
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,033
Who is that girl?

307
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:28,233
<i>Well, things turned out crazy,</i>
<i>but thank you so much for today, Full Moon.</i>

308
00:21:28,566 --> 00:21:30,633
<i>Good luck in your live show too!</i>

309
00:21:30,866 --> 00:21:31,533
<i>Yes!</i>

310
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,966
<i>Takuto... Thank you.</i>

311
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,800
Hey, that mean girl is back.

312
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,833
What?!
You mean, Madoka Wakamatsu?!

313
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:28,166
Yeah. But she's still arrogant as usual.

314
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,633
I thought she would've
been a little disheartened

315
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:32,666
by losing to Mistuki in
the recording competition,

316
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,833
but I can't believe
she hasn't changed!

317
00:23:35,633 --> 00:23:38,500
Wait a second.
She's fighting with her manager.

318
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,600
Something seems funny!

319
00:23:41,266 --> 00:23:44,633
Next time on Full Moon:
"The Real Madoka Wakamatsu."

320
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
