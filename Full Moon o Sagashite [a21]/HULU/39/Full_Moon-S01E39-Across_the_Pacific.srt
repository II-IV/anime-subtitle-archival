1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,433
When her grandmother objects
to her going to America,

2
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:10,300
Mitsuki decides to leave home
without saying anything.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,633
But when she finds out that her grandmother
used to go to a music school,

4
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:16,533
she is motivated to
try to persuade her again.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,100
She ended up going
without getting permission,

6
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:24,200
but I think her feelings
got through to her grandmother.

7
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:27,866
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,733
Got that?

9
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:34,700
Yes.

10
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:27,400
In any case, it's hard to believe
your grandmother gave you her permission.

11
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:31,866
On the other hand,
she didn't say anything to us.

12
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:34,333
<i>Grandma...</i>

13
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:49,600
<i>Eichi went off to America</i>
<i>like this two years ago too.</i>

14
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,600
<i>Eichi, I'm coming now.</i>

15
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:23,400
Wow!

16
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:33,500
Wow! I'm really here in America.

17
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:37,866
More importantly, how are we gonna
find her? With this many people...

18
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,833
Welcome to America!

19
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,366
Ms. Kazumi!

20
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,100
Welcome, Mitsuki!
I'm proud of you for coming all this way!

21
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:49,900
Anything to see Eichi!

22
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:51,833
That's right.

23
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:54,566
- No one can get in the way of my dream!
- No one can get in the way of my dream!

24
00:03:57,233 --> 00:03:59,866
Oh, Ms. Kazumi,
let me introduce you.

25
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,166
This is Dr. Wakaoji
and Ms. Oshige.

26
00:04:03,466 --> 00:04:05,300
I'm Wakaoji. Nice to meet you

27
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,733
I'm Oshige.

28
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:10,966
I'm Kazumi Franklin.
Very nice of you to come.

29
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,333
Thank you for having us.
It is an honor to meet you.

30
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:17,566
Of course,
there's no one to greet us.

31
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,066
That's the way it goes.

32
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:23,000
Oh, Takuto!

33
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:25,100
Don't, Nick!

34
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,800
Oh? So that baby is yours,
Ms. Kazumi?

35
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:31,766
That's right. This is my son Nick
and my husband Jim.

36
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,800
Nice to meet you, Mr. Franklin.

37
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:38,633
Nice to meet you, Mitsuki.

38
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,666
Huh?

39
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:47,033
Nevada...you said?

40
00:04:47,766 --> 00:04:51,633
Yes, there's someone in a town
at the edge of Lake Roslyn there

41
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,233
who knows Mr. and Mrs. Sakurai.

42
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:57,466
It's about ten hours
by car from here.

43
00:04:57,933 --> 00:05:00,166
What?! It's that far?!

44
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:03,233
It's that way.

45
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:04,466
Oh, okay.

46
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:09,466
<i>I'm coming to see you, Eichi.</i>

47
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,466
But Ms. Kazumi,
how did you find out?

48
00:05:14,066 --> 00:05:16,800
I have a bit of
an information network.

49
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:17,500
What?!

50
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:24,000
<i>Is that a shady and mysterious group?</i>
<i>Or perhaps a shady psychic?</i>

51
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,033
I think it'll be all right if you see that person,
but do you want me to go with you?

52
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:34,233
Knowing that much is the same as
finding him. We'll be all right on our own.

53
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,300
I see.

54
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:39,633
Well, here's that person's address.
If you need anything, please contact me.

55
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:40,533
Yes.

56
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
<i>So it's Eichi...</i>

57
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:49,066
<i>I wonder why I'm starting to</i>
<i>acknowledge Eichi's existence now.</i>

58
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,233
<i>I had no real sense of him</i>
<i>when we were in Japan.</i>

59
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:02,033
<i>Eichi, I've finally come</i>
<i>all the way here.</i>

60
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:14,433
We're here!

61
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,566
Wow, it's beautiful!

62
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:21,566
Oh, I'm envious!

63
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:22,966
What's up with that?

64
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:27,166
Remember, she's said before, she likes
rooms with a view of the ocean.

65
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:30,000
But it's the same Pacific Ocean.

66
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,600
In that sense, I guess Japan
and America are connected.

67
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:36,266
Come to think of it,

68
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,700
Eichi once said that the Pacific Ocean
is exactly the same size as the moon.

69
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:42,400
Huh?

70
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:45,066
So the moon was once
in the Pacific Ocean?!

71
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:47,166
I don't know about that.

72
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:52,866
Maybe the lost Mu continent was the moon?
If so, that's incredible!

73
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,533
There's no chance of that!

74
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,733
<i>Grandma...</i>

75
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:05,300
<i>Please listen to</i>
<i>my songs someday.</i>

76
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,433
<i>Mitsuki, you can only see</i>
<i>one face of the moon from Earth.</i>

77
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:54,433
<i>Even such a beautiful moon has marks</i>
<i>on the other side from meteors falling on it.</i>

78
00:07:58,033 --> 00:08:00,200
<i>Continuing to shine</i>
<i>despite the scars.</i>

79
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,200
<i>When I first met you, Mitsuki,</i>
<i>I thought it was a perfect name for you.</i>

80
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,166
Ms. Kazumi...

81
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,333
Mitsuki, do you remember
this photograph?

82
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:22,133
What?

83
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:27,633
I-I remember it.

84
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:33,500
Oh? Mitsuki doesn't look happy
at all in the photograph.

85
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:35,033
I know.

86
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:37,233
I don't know what happened
at the Christmas party,

87
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,600
but she sulked the whole time.

88
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:41,533
Did you have a fight
with Eichi or something?

89
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,933
Let me see,
I forget what happened.

90
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,833
Oh, you don't remember?

91
00:08:47,566 --> 00:08:48,633
<i>I remember.</i>

92
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,633
<i>On the night of</i>
<i>the Christmas party.</i>

93
00:09:01,433 --> 00:09:03,533
<i>Your hands are warm, Eichi.</i>

94
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,466
<i>Mitsuki...</i>

95
00:09:07,266 --> 00:09:10,733
<i>There'll come a day</i>
<i>when we'll be separated.</i>

96
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,100
<i>That won't happen!</i>
<i>We'll always be together.</i>

97
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:21,933
<i>Isn't that right?</i>

98
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:28,633
<i>I don't know. But if and when that happens,</i>
<i>I'm afraid you'll forget me and leave.</i>

99
00:09:30,566 --> 00:09:35,233
<i>That's why I want you to always</i>
<i>let me be near you like this.</i>

100
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,900
<i>Mitsuki...I really like you.</i>

101
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,066
<i>Now everyone,</i>
<i>look at the camera.</i>

102
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,900
<i>- Okay!</i>
<i>- Okay!</i>

103
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,866
<i>Okay, everyone smile!</i>
<i>One, two...</i>

104
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:21,600
<i>It was after that...when I was told that</i>
<i>Eichi would be going to America.</i>

105
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:37,400
Oh, Nick!

106
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:39,266
You shouldn't be so rough!

107
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,733
Please, I'm asking you.

108
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:44,800
Here, I'll lift you way high up.

109
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,833
Actually...

110
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,400
He was lost...and when I took
him to where he wanted to go,

111
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:55,400
he asked to take me out
to dinner to thank me.

112
00:10:55,766 --> 00:11:00,500
But I didn't know that you were
fluent in English, Ms. Kazumi.

113
00:11:00,866 --> 00:11:04,333
No, Jim was fluent in Japanese.

114
00:11:04,566 --> 00:11:05,566
Oh...

115
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,133
But I was surprised.

116
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:11,000
As soon as our meal ended,
he asked me to go out with him.

117
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,066
I couldn't help but ask you.
It was love at first sight.

118
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,400
But of course I couldn't
give my answer right there.

119
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,766
Y-Yeah.

120
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:23,833
<i>Mitsuki...I really like you.</i>

121
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,700
Of course.

122
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,333
So I later replied with a video letter.

123
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:34,566
Oh, that was when...

124
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:37,700
I was happy when I
received the video letter.

125
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:40,500
I thought it was
the happiest day of my life.

126
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:47,533
<i>I didn't even know I'd</i>
<i>soon be apart from Eichi.</i>

127
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:13,066
<i>I just kept running away...</i>
<i>simply because I was embarrassed.</i>

128
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:42,566
So you've at least heard of them,
right, Mitsuki?

129
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:45,700
The musical actress Eleanor Pain

130
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:48,833
and the vocalist Steel of
the hard rock band THEM.

131
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,766
Yeah.

132
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:53,666
Apparently their throats were fixed
through Dr. Lon Herberd's surgeries.

133
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:55,333
Is that so?

134
00:12:57,266 --> 00:12:58,666
Thanks for waiting, you two.

135
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:01,633
This is Dr. Lon Herberd.

136
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Hello.

137
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,266
What do you think?

138
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:13,200
I think your measures to stop the progress
with medication were appropriate.

139
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:16,033
However, surgery will
be needed in due course.

140
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:20,200
But it may be difficult from a stamina
standpoint given this girl's age.

141
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,900
Her mentality is also
an important element.

142
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:30,033
The best choice would be for you,
a person she absolutely trusts,

143
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:34,833
to perform the surgery in your hospital where
there'd be no communication difficulties.

144
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:35,900
I understand.

145
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:41,466
If your hospital expresses a reluctance to
bring in the equipment, we could do it here.

146
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:43,033
Thank you very much.

147
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:45,666
- Tony, how does your throat feel?
- I'll do my best to convince them so

148
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,200
- It's all right, Mom.
- the operation can take place in Japan.

149
00:13:47,566 --> 00:13:51,533
The doctor also told me to let
my throat gradually get used to it.

150
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:55,466
Really? I'm so glad. At one point,
I didn't know what would happen.

151
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:57,466
Not that again.

152
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,500
- That child was the same as you,
- You're such a worrier.

153
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:03,800
but he's recovered to that point.

154
00:14:04,766 --> 00:14:07,133
I want you to get well like that too.

155
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:20,266
Herberd... Herberd...
Nothing.

156
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,800
W-Well, it is work.

157
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,966
What? You don't need
to tell me that. I know.

158
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:32,433
Oh... I see.
If that's the case, then...

159
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Looks like they're done.

160
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,800
So, next we have to go make
an appearance at AAS Broadcasting.

161
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:41,400
I need to transform her.

162
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:47,266
I thought he was criticizing me,
but it was only my imagination.

163
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,733
Oh, this is throwing me off.

164
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,966
So now our work is done.

165
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:57,833
Yes.

166
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,033
Meroko!
What's the matter?

167
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:07,033
Oh, I guess there's
no use worrying.

168
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,133
Come on, let's go sightseeing!
Let's go!

169
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:15,466
Let's do that!

170
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:16,600
Yeah!

171
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:25,333
All right!

172
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,833
Wow!

173
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:30,033
Watch out!

174
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,233
It's your first time, right?

175
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:33,533
Yes.

176
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,233
I'll hold your hand.

177
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:37,500
Thank you.

178
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:52,633
- Hi!
- Hi!

179
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,900
- Hi!
- Hi!

180
00:15:58,466 --> 00:16:01,366
Maybe it's the nice weather,
but she looks healthy too.

181
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:08,100
We Death Spirits really don't fit in
on the West Coast, huh, Meroko?

182
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,666
Meroko?

183
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:19,733
So it's only me that doesn't fit in.

184
00:16:30,566 --> 00:16:31,233
There!

185
00:16:31,266 --> 00:16:31,933
There!

186
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:35,333
There!

187
00:16:35,966 --> 00:16:37,066
Go Mitsuki!

188
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:37,766
There!

189
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:40,366
I did it!

190
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,400
Yay!

191
00:16:52,033 --> 00:16:54,533
<i>Maybe I shouldn't have</i>
<i>come to America.</i>

192
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,000
<i>She looks like</i>
<i>she's having fun.</i>

193
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,733
<i>That's understandable.</i>
<i>She is closer to Eichi.</i>

194
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,966
<i>So what is it that</i>
<i>I want to do?</i>

195
00:17:04,866 --> 00:17:07,066
<i>She's a human and</i>
<i>I'm a Death Spirit.</i>

196
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,800
<i>Even if I could share my feelings,</i>
<i>what would happen?</i>

197
00:17:11,566 --> 00:17:14,133
<i>I can't make her happy.</i>

198
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,600
<i>More importantly,</i>
<i>she likes Eichi.</i>

199
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,500
<i>There's no need for me.</i>

200
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:29,633
<i>I fully understand this,</i>
<i>but why can't I tear myself away?</i>

201
00:17:40,366 --> 00:17:41,900
That was fun!

202
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,433
It really was!

203
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,566
Welcome back!

204
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:47,066
- We're home!
- We're home!

205
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,800
Oh, New Year's pine decorations?

206
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:52,300
Tomorrow is New Year's.
So we do this as a Japanese custom.

207
00:17:52,566 --> 00:17:56,133
That's right, let's all eat noodles
to ring in the New Year tonight!

208
00:17:56,433 --> 00:17:57,833
Really?

209
00:17:58,766 --> 00:17:59,766
Here, eat up!

210
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,800
- Thank you!
- This looks great!

211
00:18:02,933 --> 00:18:05,200
I never thought I'd come
all the way to America

212
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:07,266
and be able to eat noodles
to welcome in the New Year.

213
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,533
Right? Eat as much as you'd like.

214
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,466
Thank you.

215
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:17,666
<i>Even when I knew Eichi</i>
<i>was going to America,</i>

216
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,733
<i>I still couldn't say</i>
<i>anything to him.</i>

217
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:46,866
<i>So this is where you were.</i>

218
00:18:57,733 --> 00:18:58,833
<i>You don't need to pick it up.</i>

219
00:18:59,300 --> 00:18:59,966
<i>What?!</i>

220
00:19:04,566 --> 00:19:09,233
<i>Mitsuki, sorry for making you worry.</i>
<i>Please forget about me.</i>

221
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:11,433
<i>You don't need to worry anymore.</i>

222
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,166
<i>Y-You're mistaken! I...</i>
<i>Wait, Eichi!</i>

223
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
<i>The pendant!</i>

224
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,666
<i>The same Eichi that said he was afraid</i>
<i>of being forgotten told me to forget him.</i>

225
00:19:28,633 --> 00:19:32,400
<i>I made such a nice person say</i>
<i>something to push me away.</i>

226
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,866
<i>I realized that I liked Eichi as I cried,</i>
<i>thinking about how much he thought of me.</i>

227
00:19:46,266 --> 00:19:47,266
<i>I found it!</i>

228
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:56,166
<i>After that, I was somehow</i>
<i>able to talk to Eichi,</i>

229
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,333
<i>but ultimately, the day to say goodbye came</i>
<i>before I was able to tell him I liked him.</i>

230
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:04,033
<i>I won't forget any of you.</i>
<i>Take care.</i>

231
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,366
<i>- Bye bye!</i>
<i>- Take care!</i>

232
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,133
<i>Take care, Eichi!</i>

233
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:19,566
<i>No! No!</i>
<i>Don't go, Eichi.</i>

234
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:24,566
<i>Don't cry, Mitsuki.</i>
<i>America isn't that far away.</i>

235
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,000
<i>But...</i>

236
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:32,300
<i>So let's make a promise that we'll</i>
<i>be closer to achieving our dreams</i>

237
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,866
<i>than we are now</i>
<i>when we next meet.</i>

238
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,466
<i>I wanna be an astronomer.</i>

239
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:38,266
<i>And you wanna be a singer.</i>

240
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,233
<i>He may have</i>
<i>understood my feelings,</i>

241
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:53,933
<i>but in the end, I wasn't able</i>
<i>to tell him that liked him.</i>

242
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:19,966
W-What?
New Year's Eve bells even in America?

243
00:21:21,233 --> 00:21:23,400
No, those are church bells.

244
00:21:36,366 --> 00:21:38,400
<i>But this time I'll say it.</i>

245
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:42,633
<i>That I really like you, Eichi.</i>

246
00:23:19,033 --> 00:23:22,333
She's so stupid! Being in America
has made her so careless!

247
00:23:22,466 --> 00:23:24,033
What's wrong, Takuto?!

248
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:27,733
Mitsuki lost the pendant
she's always wearing!

249
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,933
You mean, the precious pendant
that Eichi gave her?

250
00:23:32,366 --> 00:23:35,266
Jeez, I can't believe it.
I'm gonna go help her find it.

251
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,933
Takuto! Wait up!

252
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,900
Next time on Full Moon:
"The Stolen Pendant."

253
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:44,533
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
