1
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:15,566
I can tell you,
but can I take your soul?

2
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:18,900
Okay, as long as
we can save Takuto!

3
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:21,866
Well then...

4
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,533
Well, I will have you kiss me.

5
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,200
A-A kiss?

6
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:14,566
Yes, it's a ceremony for the promise
to entrust your soul.

7
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,100
If you are serious about
entrusting your soul,

8
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:19,133
then you should be able to do it.

9
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,866
Mikki...

10
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,400
I-If I kiss...

11
00:02:37,933 --> 00:02:40,566
If I kiss you,
you'll really teach me how to

12
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,500
prevent Takuto from
becoming a ghost?

13
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:53,066
Do you want to go
that far to save Takuto?

14
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,566
I want to save him!
It's only natural that I do!

15
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:04,566
Natural? I've never heard of a human
helping a Death Spirit, even in fairytales.

16
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,733
But... But Takuto
is my precious...

17
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:09,366
Precious what?

18
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:10,800
Precious...

19
00:03:12,466 --> 00:03:14,333
friend.

20
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:20,100
Hmm... A friend. Then I'll ask you,
what is a friend?

21
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,200
Can you do anything
for a friend?

22
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:27,500
I-I don't know very well,

23
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:31,700
but I feel that if there is something
that I can do for my friend,

24
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:32,733
I'd do anything I can.

25
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:36,933
Takuto is a Death Spirit who
came to cut off your life.

26
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Do you understand that?

27
00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:41,100
I understand that, but...

28
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,000
But that doesn't matter at all!

29
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,266
It doesn't matter whether
you're a Death Spirit or not.

30
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,900
A friend is a friend!

31
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:49,266
<i>Why?</i>

32
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,300
<i>How can this child work</i>
<i>so hard for somebody else?</i>

33
00:03:56,533 --> 00:04:01,333
<i>I believe that loving someone means</i>
<i>having that kind of tranquil big heart.</i>

34
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,533
<i>You probably don't</i>
<i>understand, do you?</i>

35
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:09,300
<i>That's your misfortune, Izumi.</i>

36
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
<i>My misfortune?</i>

37
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,500
I-I understand.

38
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,566
If you'll teach me how to
save Takuto, then I...

39
00:04:23,933 --> 00:04:29,166
If Takuto is really going to be saved...
I-Izumi, by all means!

40
00:04:39,966 --> 00:04:41,400
What's so funny?!

41
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:43,166
I think I'll decline.

42
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Huh? What do you mean?

43
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:50,833
Actually, I don't know of a way to
stop him from becoming a ghost.

44
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,000
W-What?

45
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:57,533
See you later, Mikki.

46
00:04:57,633 --> 00:04:58,633
Please wait!

47
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:02,700
I beg of you,
I need to save Takuto!

48
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:07,433
So... So...

49
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:13,666
Izumi!

50
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:16,733
If you find out something,
please tell me!

51
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:56,866
<i>I haven't disappeared yet.</i>

52
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:01,900
Takuto, what's wrong?

53
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:03,900
Mitsuki.

54
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:07,400
Were you in pain again?

55
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,900
S-Stupid, that's not
the case at all!

56
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:13,266
More importantly, are you making
progress preparing for your concert?

57
00:06:13,466 --> 00:06:15,266
Y-Yeah, of course.

58
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,300
Good. Jeez, you better not become
careless just because I'm not around.

59
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,700
Got it?

60
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:22,966
Yes.

61
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
<i>Takuto...</i>

62
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,466
Gosh...

63
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,533
Why are old books so heavy?!

64
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:37,600
Hey Takuto.

65
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:38,733
Huh?

66
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,633
Are you all right?

67
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:43,133
What do you mean?

68
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:45,400
I mean...

69
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,700
Takuto, please don't go away.

70
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:52,833
Please don't.

71
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,766
I'm so tired.

72
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,800
I'm home.

73
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,600
So that's it?

74
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,900
I was wondering what you were going
to say with such a somber face.

75
00:07:08,466 --> 00:07:11,966
Stupid, I won't disappear that easily!

76
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:12,833
But...

77
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:17,400
My goodness... Don't worry
about unnecessary things.

78
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:25,333
Just think about
your concert right now.

79
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,700
Takuto...

80
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:28,800
Don't worry.

81
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,700
I'll be fine.

82
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:46,466
If loving someone was going
to feel like this, I wish I never—

83
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,166
Mitsuki?

84
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,766
I'm practicing for the concert!

85
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,300
Listen, Takuto.

86
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,666
Okay.

87
00:07:57,233 --> 00:08:02,233
My tears won't stop.

88
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,833
<i>Both Mitsuki and Takuto</i>
<i>are working so hard.</i>

89
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:10,700
<i>Each one thinking</i>
<i>about the other...</i>

90
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,766
Well, then.

91
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:17,433
I'm going to do
some investigation.

92
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:23,933
I might find a hint for preventing
him from becoming a ghost.

93
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:26,600
All right, what have we here?

94
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:32,166
Then, please also give
my regards to Full Moon.

95
00:08:32,366 --> 00:08:34,200
Yes, thank you
for all your work.

96
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,700
Oh? Is that you, Ms. Oshige?

97
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,233
Oh, Mr. Todoroki!

98
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:39,866
Good morning.

99
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,800
Huh? Where's Full Moon?

100
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:45,400
Oh, yes. Full Moon is preparing
for her concert right now.

101
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:50,433
Oh yeah, I heard. So Full Moon is in
seclusion doing special lessons?

102
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,966
She's really putting
her heart into it!

103
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,933
<i>In seclusion? Who said such a thing?</i>
<i>Gosh, this industry...</i>

104
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,266
Mr. Todoroki!

105
00:08:59,633 --> 00:09:02,866
Yeah, I'll be right over.
Okay then, we'll catch up later.

106
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:04,300
I'll look forward to the concert!

107
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,100
Thank you very much.

108
00:09:11,866 --> 00:09:14,266
<i>Whatever the rumors may be,</i>

109
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,766
<i>Mitsuki can't be</i>
<i>forcing herself right now.</i>

110
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:27,466
<i>If Mitsuki cannot transform to Full Moon</i>
<i>on the day of the concert...</i>

111
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,000
<i>Don't think about such a thing!</i>

112
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:34,666
<i>Takuto and Meroko were saying that</i>
<i>they are definitely going to transform her,</i>

113
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,733
<i>so I have to work to</i>
<i>make this concert a success.</i>

114
00:09:38,066 --> 00:09:40,200
Ow, ow! So hot!

115
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,466
All right, what does it say here?

116
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:51,933
Drip one drop of the morning dew
collected from the roses on his eyelids

117
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,166
and recite a spell.

118
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,900
Okay then!

119
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,666
Mero-Mero!
Morning Dew of Roses!

120
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:04,333
Well then...

121
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:16,966
Now, for the spell. S-Susha,
doriapisuku, ekkutirijira, furikapasu!

122
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,666
Hey.

123
00:10:19,266 --> 00:10:21,300
What have you started now?

124
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,433
H-Huh?

125
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:26,200
What do you mean "Huh?"

126
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:29,300
I-I mean... Sorry.

127
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:32,466
<i>This isn't working at all!</i>

128
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Meroko?

129
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:35,866
What are you doing?

130
00:10:38,966 --> 00:10:40,000
Oh, I see.

131
00:10:40,866 --> 00:10:43,100
It's a legend of
the human world after all.

132
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,766
Of course it wouldn't
work on a Death Spirit.

133
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:50,466
I keep on making
a bunch of mistakes.

134
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,766
That's not true.

135
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:59,366
You did it for Takuto's sake.
What you're doing is not wrong at all.

136
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,700
Mitsuki...

137
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:04,066
What are you doing?

138
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,900
I-Izumi!

139
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,333
Izumi, why are you here?

140
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,233
What in the world do you want?

141
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:34,133
Huh?

142
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:38,666
I did little bit of research on how to
stop him from becoming a ghost.

143
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:40,500
You researched for us?

144
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:41,400
Yes.

145
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:43,766
Then Takuto can be saved?

146
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,166
Possibly...

147
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,966
Wait a minute, is that true Izumi?

148
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,800
It's Mikki and your choice to
believe me or not. Which will it be?

149
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,866
I beg of you! Please teach us!

150
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:01,666
This is the Mystic Lily that
blossoms in the Spirit World.

151
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,700
It's also known as
the Flower of Forgetfulness.

152
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:06,766
When you eat it,
you lose your entire memory.

153
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:09,200
Hence it's name.

154
00:12:10,266 --> 00:12:12,166
This will save Takuto?

155
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,866
Yes. I believe a Death Spirit
who recovers his memory

156
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:20,133
becomes a ghost because of
the attachment to his life on earth.

157
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:24,900
That's why, if his memory is erased
with this Flower of Forgetfulness...

158
00:12:25,433 --> 00:12:27,400
Erase his memory?

159
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,100
Does that mean his memories as
a Death Spirit will also be erased?

160
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,233
Yes, he'll forget everything...
even about you two.

161
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:36,900
Oh no.

162
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,133
Takuto is going to
forget about us?

163
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:44,266
I couldn't find anything else
that would work.

164
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,566
I think this is probably the only way
to stop him from becoming a ghost.

165
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:53,866
Izumi, here, let's eat some
roasted sweets potatoes.

166
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,500
Wait! If I remember correctly,
the Flower of Forgetfulness is...

167
00:12:58,933 --> 00:12:59,600
Yes.

168
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,433
The flower only blooms on

169
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:03,400
the day of the lunar eclipse
in the Spirit World calendar.

170
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,100
When is that?

171
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,066
It's today!

172
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,533
What? Then, is there a chance?

173
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,800
This Flower of Forgetfulness
blooms in a cave

174
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,900
at the Forbidden Forest
in the Spirit World.

175
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:20,600
Normally, the entrance to this cave
is closed and you can't enter.

176
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:22,966
But the entrance opens only
during the lunar eclipse

177
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,100
when the flower blooms.

178
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,066
The flower possesses
a strong power

179
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,566
and does not allow
anyone to approach it.

180
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,766
It's such a powerful flower

181
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,333
that even Death Spirit power
becomes ineffective near it.

182
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,966
Is that so?

183
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,666
- But for Takuto, I—
- Mero.

184
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,866
You'd be breaking the laws
of the Spirit World.

185
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,500
Who knows what kind of punishment
will be handed down.

186
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,933
Are you prepared for that?

187
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,333
Nobody will wake up with this.

188
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:21,000
It's now connected
with the Spirit World.

189
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:26,000
Now Mitsuki, after I enter the cave,
measure the time with this.

190
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:30,200
I'm going to lose my sense
of time inside the cave.

191
00:14:30,966 --> 00:14:34,833
You have to get out of the cave
before all of the sand falls, right?

192
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,633
Yeah, if I don't do it in time,

193
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,700
I won't be able to come out
until the next lunar eclipse.

194
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:41,433
If that happens...

195
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,666
Meroko!

196
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:50,600
Are you really okay? Isn't this
a serious violation of the regulations?

197
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,800
If it's about violating regulations,
I've already done that many times.

198
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,900
Being such good friends
with you is actually a violation.

199
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,200
Meroko...

200
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:08,300
I also want to help Takuto
as much as you. Now, I'll be off.

201
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,666
Meroko! Be careful!

202
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,300
It's been so long.

203
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,433
Hey, Meroko?

204
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,066
What are you doing here today?

205
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:40,400
I bet you made a blunder again and
were called in by the Division Chief.

206
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:41,900
Y-Yeah.

207
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:43,800
I suppose it's
something like that.

208
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,366
Well, I'm in a hurry so...

209
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,633
Hey, wait Meroko!

210
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:54,300
<i>Sorry, I don't have time</i>
<i>to hang out right now!</i>

211
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:03,466
Oh boy, she really went ahead.

212
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,500
She has some courage.

213
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,866
<i>The lunar eclipse</i>
<i>hasn't started yet.</i>

214
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,766
<i>Looks like I'll be on time.</i>

215
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:19,133
Huh?

216
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:21,800
Meroko!

217
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,900
Oh no!

218
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:27,666
<i>What a forest...</i>

219
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:29,866
I found it!

220
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
There it is!

221
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,066
Thank goodness.

222
00:16:34,966 --> 00:16:35,633
What?

223
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,800
The lunar eclipse has started.

224
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,500
Please make it in time.

225
00:16:49,433 --> 00:16:50,733
<i>Meroko, are you okay?</i>

226
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:51,966
Y-Yeah.

227
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,133
<i>Oh right, I can't use my powers</i>
<i>inside the cave.</i>

228
00:16:57,866 --> 00:16:58,533
That's...

229
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
the Flower of Forgetfulness!

230
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,633
<i>You can do it, Meroko!</i>

231
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,666
<i>A small wound</i>
<i>like this is nothing.</i>

232
00:17:16,566 --> 00:17:18,866
Meroko, run away! Meroko!

233
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,700
<i>Meroko, the time...</i>

234
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,533
There is only about
half remaining.

235
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,300
Just a little longer,
I'll make it on time!

236
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,000
Huh?

237
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,700
<i>What's wrong?</i>

238
00:17:42,933 --> 00:17:44,033
Oh, nothing.

239
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:53,700
Meroko!

240
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,733
<i>Meroko...</i>

241
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,800
Meroko! Please return now!

242
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:09,733
I can't...return.

243
00:18:10,033 --> 00:18:11,166
But if you keep on going—

244
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,866
<i>Mitsuki!</i>

245
00:18:13,366 --> 00:18:17,300
I finally found something
that I can do for Takuto.

246
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:19,133
Meroko...

247
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,633
That's why I'm not going to
give up until the end!

248
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,166
<i>What...I can do...</i>

249
00:18:31,933 --> 00:18:35,500
<i>What I can do for</i>
<i>Meroko right now...</i>

250
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,133
<i>Why do I like you so much?</i>

251
00:18:47,266 --> 00:18:53,266
Your voice echoes and
it sounds almost sad.

252
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:57,733
<i>This is probably</i>
<i>the only thing I can do.</i>

253
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,233
<i>Meroko, don't give up.</i>

254
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:04,533
Mitsuki...

255
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:15,833
<i>- Why do I like you so much?</i>
<i>- Why do I like you so much?</i>

256
00:19:16,033 --> 00:19:19,100
<i>- Your voice echoes and</i>
<i>- Your voice echoes and</i>

257
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:21,933
<i>- it sounds almost sad.</i>
<i>- it sounds almost sad.</i>

258
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:28,033
<i>- Up to now who was supporting me?</i>
<i>- Up to now who was supporting me?</i>

259
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:31,100
<i>- I realize, now that I'm far away</i>
<i>- I realize, now that I'm far away</i>

260
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:35,966
<i>- what was supporting me.</i>
<i>- what was supporting me.</i>

261
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:56,400
<i>Why do I like you?</i>
<i>That's too easy to answer.</i>

262
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:05,533
Meroko!

263
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,500
Meroko! Meroko!

264
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:11,066
No way...

265
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:13,233
Mitsuki.

266
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,400
Meroko!

267
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:19,266
Your feelings reached me.

268
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,333
Meroko! Meroko,
get a hold of yourself!

269
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,100
Meroko!

270
00:20:25,566 --> 00:20:26,766
Meroko!

271
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,400
This is the Flower
of Forgetfulness?

272
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,933
Takuto doesn't need to
become a ghost now.

273
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,566
Thank you, Meroko.

274
00:20:37,866 --> 00:20:40,866
No, I'm the one who
should be thanking you.

275
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,766
I was able to get it with
the help of your singing.

276
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,100
Oh, there you two are!

277
00:20:46,966 --> 00:20:48,433
Good morning, Takuto.

278
00:20:48,566 --> 00:20:49,800
Good morning!

279
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,533
Huh? What happened to you?

280
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:55,766
Oh, this? I had a little fight with
the cat on the second block.

281
00:20:56,566 --> 00:20:57,566
Oh yeah?

282
00:20:57,933 --> 00:21:01,666
More importantly, I was thinking about
the production for the upcoming concert,

283
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,700
and I was recalling all of
your past performances.

284
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:06,533
Like, didn't we grow wings
the first time?

285
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:10,066
And after that, we shined
the pendant at the solo concert.

286
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:15,033
Isn't it going to be your last concert?
Let's make it incredible.

287
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:18,366
So it will become memorable
for everyone who watches it!

288
00:21:20,266 --> 00:21:20,933
What's up?

289
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:25,133
Oh, Takuto, it's because what you said
was unexpectedly sentimental!

290
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,466
What does that mean?

291
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,733
It's fine, it's fine!

292
00:21:27,766 --> 00:21:28,766
No, it's not!

293
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,166
<i>- After Takuto's memory is erased,</i>
- But still, you're really roughed up!

294
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:33,200
<i>- we can't hang out like this anymore.</i>
- How rude!

295
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:34,233
Whose fault
do you think it is

296
00:21:34,266 --> 00:21:35,900
<i>- Staying a Death Spirit</i>
- that I look like this?!

297
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:37,466
<i>- by losing his memories</i>
- You said it was the cat on

298
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,166
the second block, right?

299
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,566
<i>- or becoming a ghost</i>
- Y-Yeah, it's because of the cat.

300
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,100
<i>- by holding on to the memories.</i>
- The cat, the cat, the cat!

301
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:45,133
<i>- Which one would make Takuto happy?</i>
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

302
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:24,000
Takuto... If... I'm only saying if,
but if there were a way to

303
00:23:24,033 --> 00:23:27,133
prevent you from becoming a ghost,
what would you do?

304
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,166
Huh? If there were a way,
I would've already done it.

305
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:34,400
But you become a ghost because you
regain your memory, right? Then...

306
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:36,333
You're saying I should
lose my memory?

307
00:23:36,466 --> 00:23:39,633
No thanks. I wouldn't go
as far as to lose my memory.

308
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:41,133
Takuto...

309
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,500
Next time on Full Moon:
"I Can't Confess!"

310
00:23:46,066 --> 00:23:47,066
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
