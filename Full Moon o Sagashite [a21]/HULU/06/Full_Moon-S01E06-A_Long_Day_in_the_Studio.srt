1
00:00:05,633 --> 00:00:07,900
This is Mitsuki Koyama,
12 years old.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,400
She went on her first job as
the singer, Full Moon,

3
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:14,033
but she kept messing everything up
trying to come off as grown-up.

4
00:00:14,366 --> 00:00:15,966
And immediately made
everyone mad!

5
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:19,266
But after talking to a bunch
of high school girls,

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,233
she realized she didn't have
to try too hard to be mature.

7
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:24,600
And work got easier and
ended well, soon after.

8
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:27,833
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

9
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:33,600
Got that?

10
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:34,633
Yes.

11
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:22,133
I want to go, too!

12
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,633
You can't! You have to transform
into Mitsuki and stay here.

13
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:29,466
Otherwise, she wouldn't be able to escape
the eyes of that old lady and go out.

14
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:32,133
But, there's been nothing
like this before, right?

15
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:35,766
It wasn't convenient for
Dr. Wakaoji today.

16
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,300
In other words,
somebody has to take her place.

17
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,500
I have to transform her
into a sixteen-year-old,

18
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:43,566
so there's no way, right?

19
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,600
So you're the only one, Meroko.

20
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:47,800
But...

21
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:50,066
Meroko, please.

22
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,066
Today is the recording of
my important debut song.

23
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,566
So...Please?

24
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,966
Fine.

25
00:02:58,233 --> 00:02:58,966
Really?!

26
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,966
But there'll be a time
when she'll stay home for once...

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,533
- And then Takuto and I can go out, right?
- All right, let's go.

28
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,600
Hey, did they just ignore me?!

29
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:34,166
It's this studio, right?

30
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:37,366
Wooow.
There are tons of fans.

31
00:03:37,766 --> 00:03:39,766
I wonder who in the world is here.

32
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,633
Who cares who it is?

33
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:42,433
More importantly...

34
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,333
What? Who is it?
Who is it?

35
00:03:45,366 --> 00:03:46,133
Hey, Wait!

36
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:52,566
Say-say,
those are the Guitar Fighters.

37
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,400
They're going to be recording now.

38
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:55,866
Awesome!

39
00:03:56,633 --> 00:04:00,100
Hey-hey.
Didn't you come to record, too?

40
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,633
What?!

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,700
But... But...

42
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:04,200
Jeez.

43
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:05,100
Let's go.

44
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,833
Okay, we're going in.

45
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:36,966
Hey, Mitsuki!

46
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:38,933
Oh, Ms. Oshige!

47
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,900
What're you doing?

48
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,333
Over here, over here!
Get over here, quick.

49
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:47,466
O-Okay!

50
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,033
Oh, my.
Everyone's watching.

51
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:56,200
It won't do a person who's going to be
a singer any good to act like that.

52
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:56,800
Right.

53
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,233
A talking stuffed toy?

54
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,400
How's it going?
Were you able to sleep yesterday?

55
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:12,566
Yes, for the time being.

56
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,533
That's good.

57
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,733
Let's do our best today.

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,366
Right.

59
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:22,500
Okay, go on in.

60
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,866
Wow...

61
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,133
I'm overwhelmed.

62
00:05:39,433 --> 00:05:41,766
Oh, sorry.
Let me introduce you.

63
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,733
This is Miss Full Moon, and she will
start recording from today!

64
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,866
Oh, I'm Full Moon.
Nice to meet you all!

65
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:49,166
We look forward
to working with you!

66
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,500
Hang in there, Mitsuki.

67
00:05:55,866 --> 00:05:56,533
I will.

68
00:05:56,566 --> 00:05:59,100
Ouch. Are you nervous?

69
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,766
Oh. I'm sorry, Takuto.

70
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:03,500
Don't worry, I'll be watching you.

71
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,266
Okay.

72
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:06,533
Ow-ow-ow.

73
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,800
Will she be okay?

74
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,266
Miss Full Moon.
This way, please.

75
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,700
Oh, okay!

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,500
Then, it's a promise.

77
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,633
No matter what,
watch me from here, okay?

78
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,566
Yeah, yeah.

79
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,033
Huh?

80
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,033
Hey!

81
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,100
Yipes!
Oh! It's you guys.

82
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,100
You're here again.

83
00:06:31,566 --> 00:06:33,000
You'll get no sympathy
if you're found out.

84
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,466
Enough about that.

85
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,433
Did you see a young girl
carrying a stuffed toy cat?

86
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,500
A cat?

87
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,900
Oh, the girl who went
into that studio earlier.

88
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,333
Who's Full Moon?

89
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:45,933
She's the newcomer, right?

90
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,333
Really?

91
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,866
Full Moon, eh?

92
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:55,666
It's kind of quiet, isn't it?

93
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:59,766
It's been soundproofed to
not pick up any excess noise.

94
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,333
Is that so?

95
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:04,500
Is the position of the microphone
okay like this?

96
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:07,966
Oh, this is fine...I think.

97
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,500
Then, please wait a moment.

98
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:24,866
So this is where
I'm going to sing.

99
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:30,633
Takuto.

100
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:33,066
Excuse me.

101
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:34,433
We're going to
test the microphone.

102
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:35,566
Could you give us a sound?

103
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:37,166
Oh, umm...

104
00:07:40,633 --> 00:07:42,500
Umm, can you hear me?

105
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:45,166
Yes, we can.
It's okay.

106
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,600
Oh, Mr. Takasu.

107
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:49,533
Hi.

108
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,633
How's it going?

109
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:51,966
I'm managing...

110
00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:55,066
For now, let's sing "Myself" once.

111
00:07:55,366 --> 00:07:55,666
Okay.

112
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,933
Okay, sound, please.

113
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:05,300
Let's see.

114
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,700
First, put on the headphones.

115
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:07,900
Headphones?

116
00:08:08,066 --> 00:08:10,900
Listen to the music with
the headphones and sing along with that.

117
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,066
Oh, is that so?

118
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:15,433
This is the real deal, isn't it?

119
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:17,366
She's an interesting kid.

120
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,766
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,466
It's her first time, after all.

122
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:24,200
Well, she's new,
so let's take our time.

123
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,033
Thank you very much.

124
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,500
This looks like it's going
to take a while.

125
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,266
<i>Why do I...</i>

126
00:08:34,466 --> 00:08:37,400
<i>...like you...so much?</i>

127
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:43,433
<i>Your voice echoes and
sounds almost sad...</i>

128
00:08:43,466 --> 00:08:44,333
<i>Up to now—</i>

129
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:45,533
Oh, hold on a minute!

130
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:48,600
When you start singing
the peak of the song,

131
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:51,566
express the feelings you had
when you wrote this, honestly.

132
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:53,766
Honestly?

133
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:54,566
Right.

134
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,933
Don't try to sing well.
Sing with your genuine feelings.

135
00:08:58,066 --> 00:08:58,833
All right...

136
00:08:59,566 --> 00:09:01,133
Okay, it's about time to record.

137
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:13,866
Ah...

138
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,533
Kitty-cat!

139
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,666
Oh, Takuto?

140
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,333
What? A date now?
Sure. I'll go, I'll go!

141
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:26,300
Where are you going to take me?

142
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,133
What? Really?

143
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:31,666
Oh, Takuto.
So you loved me that much, huh?!

144
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,266
Me? Of course, I do, too.

145
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,233
Won't it turn out like
that for once?

146
00:09:40,566 --> 00:09:41,100
Uh-oh.

147
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,000
At this rate I won't be able
to go outside!

148
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,033
What? Takuto?

149
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,033
It looks like you're still a little nervous.

150
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:00,066
Oh, I'm sorry.

151
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,766
Well, we have some adjustments to make.
So we'll take a break.

152
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:04,466
Okay.

153
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:13,100
Are you thirsty Mitsuki?
How about some coffee?

154
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,566
Ms. Oshige, do you know where
the stuffed toy cat that was here is?

155
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,666
Stuffed toy?

156
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:19,466
Yes.

157
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:23,766
What're you doing?

158
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:26,566
Oh, it's all of the Guitar Fighters.

159
00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:28,133
Um, as a matter of fact...

160
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,366
Are you the new girl?

161
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:30,666
Yeah. You're Full Moon, right?

162
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,766
How old are you?

163
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Umm...
I-I'm looking for a stuffed toy cat.

164
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:36,966
Do you know where it is?

165
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,000
A stuffed toy cat?
Beats me.

166
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,966
Oh. Come to think of it, Nanami
might've had something like that earlier.

167
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,366
Really?

168
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,966
Where did that girl go?

169
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,500
Where?
Maybe she already went home.

170
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:52,233
What?!

171
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:55,100
Do you know where her house is?

172
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:56,900
I don't know that much.

173
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,533
I see.

174
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:01,166
<i>Takuto.</i>

175
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,800
Hm? Where am I?

176
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:11,266
Oh. You woke up, kitty-cat?

177
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,000
Whoa.

178
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,266
Talk to Nanami!

179
00:11:17,466 --> 00:11:18,633
Come on.

180
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,466
- Come on.
- Ow-ow-ow!

181
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,666
Idiot. That hurt!

182
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,100
You talked.

183
00:11:26,133 --> 00:11:28,033
Give me a break.

184
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:29,900
See ya.

185
00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:32,800
What?! Kitty-cat?

186
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,966
Where are you? Where'd you go?

187
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,933
Kitty-cat's vanished.

188
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:48,533
Give me a break!

189
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:57,766
Kitty-cat!

190
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,166
Now I won't be able
to get back to her.

191
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,400
Where is that Takuto?

192
00:12:28,866 --> 00:12:29,933
What should I do?

193
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,900
<i>When you want me at your side,</i>

194
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:41,566
<i>blow on this whistle and call me.</i>

195
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,800
<i>I'll rush over.</i>

196
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,633
What? There's no sound?

197
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:56,766
She's calling.

198
00:12:57,233 --> 00:12:59,566
Kitty-cat, don't talk to yourself.

199
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,233
Talk with Nanami.

200
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,366
Say something.

201
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,733
Ow-ow-ow! What're you doing?!

202
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:10,300
Oh, you talked.

203
00:13:10,433 --> 00:13:12,266
Are you happy I talked?!

204
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:13,800
Yeah, I'm happy.

205
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:16,633
If you're happy,
then is it okay if I go?

206
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,366
Sorry, but I'm busy.

207
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:19,366
No.

208
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,633
Why?!

209
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,366
Cuz' kitty-cat's my friend.

210
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,466
Don't make me into
your friend without asking.

211
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,633
Oh, this'll happen if you say
things like that.

212
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,000
Ow-ow!
Okay! Okay! Just stop it!

213
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,600
Then, let's play together.

214
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,133
Jeez, she's worse than Meroko.

215
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:43,066
<i>I'm bothered by terrible kitchen grease.</i>

216
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,133
- I'm bored...
<i>- In times like that, use...</i>

217
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:48,800
- Oh. They still haven't come home.
<i>- the scrubbing brush of the new century!</i>

218
00:13:49,266 --> 00:13:49,800
<i>No matter how—</i>

219
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:54,600
Come on. Who turned on the TV?

220
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,266
Oh... It wasn't me.

221
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:59,300
Hey, you're not even
going to let me watch TV?

222
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:02,700
By the way, what's Mitsuki up to,
Mrs. Tanaka?

223
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:05,333
Yes. I'll go check
the detached room right away.

224
00:14:05,766 --> 00:14:07,033
Give me a break!

225
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,433
That girl did well, putting up with this
for as long as she has.

226
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,733
What'll happen if I can't find Takuto?

227
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,266
Sure enough, this whistle is broken!

228
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,633
I can hear it!

229
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:38,933
Takuto!

230
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,233
Hi.

231
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,433
Takuto...

232
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,133
Jeez, what in the world...

233
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,366
Hey, kitty-cat.

234
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:46,266
Don't move around without asking.

235
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:46,966
Oh!

236
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,033
Can you give that toy back to me?

237
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,100
No. It's mine, you see.

238
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:57,833
But, that's really mine.

239
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:00,333
No, it's mine.

240
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,300
Takuto.

241
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:04,066
I don't get it, either.

242
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,200
So your name's Takuto, kitty-cat?

243
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:09,100
Say, Takuto.

244
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:11,800
You're Nanami's friend, right?

245
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,633
You took me away while I was sleeping
without asking

246
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,266
and you're calling me your friend?

247
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:18,833
While you were sleeping?

248
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:20,966
That's terrible, Takuto.

249
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,800
Didn't you say you'd be listening?

250
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,800
Oh, you were still practicing
at that time, right?

251
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,733
I was awake
when you started recordi—

252
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,233
Speaking of which,
what about the recording?

253
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,666
When I called earlier,

254
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,100
they said they were still making
preparations and that it was okay.

255
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:40,766
Hey, don't talk to
my Takuto all friendly like that.

256
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,033
You know Nanami, Takuto is mine.

257
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,900
Then, show me proof.

258
00:15:46,266 --> 00:15:49,566
I don't have proof... But he's mine.

259
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:51,900
You're Full Moon the singer, right?

260
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:53,766
Yeah, that's right.

261
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,866
Shouldn't you be getting back
to the studio pretty soon?

262
00:15:57,366 --> 00:16:00,633
I can't sing
if you don't give me back Takuto.

263
00:16:00,966 --> 00:16:02,866
Talking like a kid.

264
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,900
But...

265
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:05,866
Where are you going?

266
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:07,566
My house.

267
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:09,500
I see.

268
00:16:12,566 --> 00:16:14,266
This is my house.

269
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,100
What?

270
00:16:15,566 --> 00:16:17,733
Let's go inside, okay Takuto?

271
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:21,100
Takuto, what should
we do to play?

272
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:24,033
Nanami, shouldn't you be getting home?

273
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:24,833
It's okay.

274
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:27,700
Your mom and dad will be worried.

275
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,733
No, they won't.

276
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,700
Why?

277
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
I don't have a mom and dad.

278
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:31,966
Huh?!

279
00:16:33,533 --> 00:16:36,533
You don't have a mom or dad?

280
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,500
Yup.

281
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:39,633
So you're all alone?

282
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:40,366
Yup.

283
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:41,866
Nanami.

284
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:51,633
All right!
Takuto, let's go.

285
00:16:54,633 --> 00:16:56,866
This is fun!
Let's go one more time.

286
00:16:58,133 --> 00:17:02,700
<i>Come to think of it,
when Eichi left, I also...</i>

287
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,266
<i>All right! All right!</i>

288
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:24,366
Here we go!

289
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:31,366
Is that fun, Nanami?

290
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:32,666
Yeah, it is.

291
00:17:33,066 --> 00:17:34,066
I see...

292
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:41,933
So you were lonesome, right?

293
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:43,600
No, I wasn't.

294
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:44,866
You're lying.

295
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:49,366
You were lonesome,
so you took Takuto away, right?

296
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:55,266
Then, if I say that I'm lonesome,
it's okay if I don't give Takuto back?

297
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:56,000
What?

298
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,466
Is it okay if I stay with
Takuto forever?

299
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,333
Well...

300
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:05,266
Just kidding.

301
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:05,833
What?

302
00:18:06,366 --> 00:18:07,966
Everything I said was a lie.

303
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:08,933
What?!

304
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,033
My mom and dad are over there.

305
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,633
S-Say what?

306
00:18:15,066 --> 00:18:16,633
Wait, Nanami.

307
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,400
See? That's my mom and dad.

308
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,466
You're not going to say
that's a lie too, are you?

309
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:31,500
Really?

310
00:18:33,366 --> 00:18:33,900
Oh.

311
00:18:34,366 --> 00:18:35,200
Nanami.

312
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:38,466
You're total is 933 yen.

313
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:40,733
Okay. Out of 1000 yen.

314
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,833
I wonder what I should have.

315
00:18:43,566 --> 00:18:47,700
If you have a mom,
why doesn't she make food for you?

316
00:18:48,066 --> 00:18:49,333
She's busy, you see.

317
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:52,000
Is that really your mom and dad?

318
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:53,633
Oh, I'll have this.

319
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:55,600
Yup, that's really them.

320
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:02,300
But they didn't say anything
even when you came into the store.

321
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,000
It's always like that.

322
00:19:04,266 --> 00:19:05,033
Always?

323
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:06,533
Every day.

324
00:19:07,366 --> 00:19:10,233
You eat by yourself every day
in that way?

325
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:11,666
That's right.

326
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,400
Every day?

327
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,866
This makes no sense.

328
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,166
If they're your real mom and dad,
why don't they say anything?

329
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:38,666
Why?

330
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:43,200
If it were a real family, you'd say,
"I'm home," when you come home...

331
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:45,666
and they'd say, "Welcome home"
isn't it true?

332
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:49,300
If I had a mom and dad,

333
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:52,800
I'd also want them to say
"Welcome home" after I said "I'm home."

334
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,533
You HAVE a mom and dad.

335
00:19:58,066 --> 00:19:59,000
Why?!

336
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:01,833
She's...

337
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:12,966
Nanami.

338
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,866
I want them to do that, too...

339
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,966
I want to talk a lot with mom and dad!

340
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:25,200
But...they're always busy.

341
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,700
I... I...

342
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:35,800
Nanami!

343
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,266
Mom!

344
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:40,100
Mom, Mom!

345
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:45,266
We're sorry, Nanami...
I'm sorry we didn't look after you.

346
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,733
We're sorry.
Forgive us.

347
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,666
Nanami...

348
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,733
Dad!

349
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,400
I'm happy for you, Nanami.

350
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:11,533
Here... I'm sorry I took Takuto
without asking.

351
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:16,500
Good grief...
I was wondering what would happen.

352
00:21:18,766 --> 00:21:22,300
Nanami, how about going to
the recording session together?

353
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:22,833
What?

354
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,133
And not in secret this time.

355
00:21:26,466 --> 00:21:27,133
Yeah!

356
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,400
Nice.

357
00:21:32,966 --> 00:21:34,666
Her honest feelings are coming out.

358
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:35,433
Yes.

359
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,533
By the way, who's that kid?

360
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,200
I'm Full Moon's first fan!

361
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,066
What?

362
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,966
Well, it's okay, isn't it?

363
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,400
Clothes ready! Makeup ready!

364
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,866
Takuto, what are we going to do?
Will she be able to sing all right?!

365
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,033
What are you getting excited about?
It's not like you're gonna sing or anything!

366
00:23:29,066 --> 00:23:33,533
That's true, but it's her debut day!
Meroko's worried.

367
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:35,000
Well, we did everything we could,

368
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:37,066
all we have to do is sit back
and watch what happens.

369
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,800
Or...maybe she'll get
into trouble again?!

370
00:23:40,266 --> 00:23:43,766
Next time on Full Moon:
"Full Moon Debuts!"

371
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,166
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
