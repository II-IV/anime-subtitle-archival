1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,900
Oh no! What should I do?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,733
This is the worst pinch
Green Onion Ramen's been in!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,100
Takukto and I are split
right in the middle

4
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:15,100
on whether or not to let Mitsuki
go to the audition.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,866
My handbook says that
her life will be in danger

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,233
if we let her go for it.

7
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:23,666
And Takuto's feelings seem to be...

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,666
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

9
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:33,566
Got that?

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,633
Yes.

11
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:19,533
<i>I have to go...
to the audition.</i>

12
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:21,200
I won't let you go!

13
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:23,200
What's with the silly stunt?!

14
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,133
Look at this!

15
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:26,633
Audition?

16
00:02:27,866 --> 00:02:28,466
Right.

17
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,100
So don't go transforming her
and helping with her audition.

18
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:36,933
I didn't want to say it,

19
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:40,866
but something about you and
that girl is similar.

20
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:44,733
You're sure to recall the time

21
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:47,000
when you were human if
you associate with her any more.

22
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:49,933
You know what'll happen then, right?

23
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:56,033
I love you.

24
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:01,333
I never want us to part.

25
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:07,266
I don't want you to turn
into a ghost, Takuto.

26
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,600
<i>I'm tired.
I want to rest just a little.</i>

27
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:42,533
The whistle's gone.

28
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:43,966
What should I do?

29
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,733
Now I can't contact Takuto.

30
00:03:48,933 --> 00:03:49,900
Takuto.

31
00:03:57,266 --> 00:04:01,500
I don't want you
to turn into a ghost, Takuto.

32
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,600
- Mitsuki!
- Huh?!

33
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:11,600
Something's wrong.

34
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,033
Oh, Takuto!

35
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:16,233
Ma'am!

36
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:18,133
It doesn't look like
she's in the main house.

37
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,066
Ma'am!

38
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm okay.

39
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,900
I just got a little dizzy.

40
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:30,633
How much worry does
she have to cause me?

41
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,033
To think she'd sneak out of
the hospital in her condition.

42
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:36,900
- Hospital? Did she collapse?!
- Please lie down.

43
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:38,133
You haven't slept at all.

44
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:41,566
No!
I won't let you go.

45
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,200
I won't let go, even if I die.

46
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:47,633
After all... I was serious when
I confessed my love for you.

47
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:55,466
But...

48
00:04:56,966 --> 00:04:58,500
It's your 57th time, so...

49
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,533
No matter...

50
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:08,533
No matter how often I confess
my love, I mean it each time!

51
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,300
Takuto , you jerk!

52
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,133
Oh!

53
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:16,466
No!

54
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:19,766
Oww...

55
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,633
Oww!

56
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,300
Are you okay?

57
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,233
<i>Takuto is worrying about me.</i>

58
00:05:28,866 --> 00:05:31,266
It hurts and I can't get up!

59
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:34,966
Well, your only redeeming
quality is robustness.

60
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,566
So you're okay, right?

61
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,200
Wha—?!

62
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:39,433
What do you mean by "robust"?!

63
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:41,300
See? You seem okay.

64
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:43,900
<i>Oh no.</i>

65
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:46,066
<i>Since it's come to this,
it's time for my trump card!</i>

66
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,866
If you're not going to listen to my advice,
I'm going to report

67
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,766
everything that's happened to
the Division Chief of Death Spirits.

68
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,566
It's punishment.

69
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:58,366
Go ahead and tell
if you want to.

70
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,266
Takuto!

71
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,900
Even if backwards letters
appear in the handbook,

72
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:03,866
or if I'm punished by
the Division Chief of Death Spirits,

73
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,766
today, I have to go.

74
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,066
Why?!

75
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,666
Why are you putting so much
of your heart and soul into this?!

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,266
I don't know why myself.

77
00:06:13,466 --> 00:06:16,033
But I can't leave her,
so it can't be helped, right?

78
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:23,233
I feel that if she becomes
unable to sing, she'll really die.

79
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,366
You're awful.

80
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,766
You're awful, Takuto.

81
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,433
Since it's come to this,

82
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:36,966
I'll stop that girl from going to
the audition by any means necessary!

83
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,566
I'll interfere!

84
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:49,266
Where in the world did she go
in that condition?

85
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:57,900
A whistle?

86
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:04,700
Dr. Wakaoji.

87
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,766
Has anyone from
her home contacted us?

88
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:08,966
Her attendant, Ms. Tanaka,
did earlier.

89
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,000
And?

90
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,533
She hasn't gone back home yet.

91
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:17,200
She dropped the whistle?!

92
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,033
Yes. I have a place in mind,

93
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:24,500
so I'm going to try looking for her.

94
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,333
<i>I appreciate it.</i>

95
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:36,366
<i>...clear, continuing from yesterday...</i>

96
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,866
<i>today looks to have the
highest temperature of the summer.</i>

97
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:43,733
<i>And now, let's get the traffic report from
Miss Kawada at the traffic center.</i>

98
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,966
<i>Miss Kawada?</i>

99
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:45,833
<i>Yes!</i>

100
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:55,700
<i>I fell asleep here.</i>

101
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,133
I'm cold.

102
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,033
<i>Takuto hasn't come.</i>

103
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,400
<i>So I guess there's no chance now.</i>

104
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,966
Eichi...

105
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,233
<i>Mitsuki, we can only see</i>

106
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,866
<i>one side of the moon
from the earth.</i>

107
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,133
<i>Really?</i>

108
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:30,833
<i>A moon that's so beautiful.</i>

109
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,033
<i>But on the backside,</i>

110
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:36,066
<i>there are many marks from
meteorites that have landed.</i>

111
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:42,333
<i>It hides its wounds
and keeps shining.</i>

112
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:45,200
<i>When I first met you,</i>

113
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,666
<i>I thought it was
the perfect name for you.</i>

114
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,300
Eichi, I won't cry.

115
00:09:00,766 --> 00:09:03,733
<i>I won't cry until I see you.</i>

116
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:09,300
<i>If she sneaked out of the hospital,
there's only one place she'd go.</i>

117
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,600
<i>It has to be the audition venue!</i>

118
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:26,933
She's not on board.

119
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:51,233
Good morning.

120
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
Oh! Morning, Madoka.

121
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,066
Thank you for yesterday.

122
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,433
I had a lot of fun.

123
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,266
Me, too.
I got good vibes from you yesterday.

124
00:10:05,766 --> 00:10:07,033
I'll do my best today.

125
00:10:07,466 --> 00:10:09,033
I'm looking forward
to working with you.

126
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,566
Okay then,
shall we start the camera test?

127
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:13,500
All right!

128
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,400
<i>- Please pick up, Mitsuki.</i>
- Okay, Madoka. Please stand here.

129
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:38,433
<i>Where am I?</i>

130
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:44,700
<i>Where should I go.?</i>

131
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,233
<i>I can't move anymore.</i>

132
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,166
Oh my, what's wrong with this girl?

133
00:10:56,366 --> 00:10:57,833
It's probably TV or
something, isn't it?

134
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:01,166
These days, there's a lot of
reality show filming.

135
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,166
<i>I'm sorry I'm not a good girl.</i>

136
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:15,833
<i>I bet he's worried about me
sneaking out of the hospital.</i>

137
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:21,866
<i>The audition is looking impossible.</i>

138
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,766
<i>Everyone...</i>

139
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,800
<i>Takuto... Meroko...
They supported me so much.</i>

140
00:11:32,966 --> 00:11:37,300
<i>And I haven't apologized yet.</i>

141
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:51,066
<i>Why do I like you so much?</i>

142
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:57,433
<i>My tears are falling...</i>

143
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,633
<i>Here, I just wanted to sing.</i>

144
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,666
<i>I wanted...to see...Eichi.</i>

145
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:40,000
Mitsuki!

146
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:47,833
Mitsuki, hang in there!

147
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,033
Mitsuki!

148
00:12:52,466 --> 00:12:53,500
She's not breathing.

149
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:13,066
<i>Open your eyes!</i>

150
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,600
<i>Please open your eyes!</i>

151
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:21,500
Mitsuki!

152
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:25,866
Eichi?

153
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
<i>Takuto?</i>

154
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:45,066
<i>That was you just now?</i>

155
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,500
What're you doing?!

156
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:50,866
Hey! Hey! Hey!

157
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,166
What're you doing sprawled
out in a place like this?!

158
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,133
Oh! Umm...

159
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:57,066
- This way!
- Oh!

160
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,533
H-Hey...
Hold it! Hey!

161
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:26,233
Umm...

162
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,100
Are you in any pain?

163
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,833
Huh?

164
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:32,266
Oh yeah.
No, not at all.

165
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:33,133
Good.

166
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:35,033
What time's the audition?

167
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,366
Let me see.

168
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,300
It's already 11:00?!

169
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:40,500
What should I do?

170
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:42,766
The audition's already started!

171
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:44,800
Oh no.

172
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,066
Hurry. We can still make it.

173
00:14:46,366 --> 00:14:47,200
What?

174
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:49,533
You're going to have
Eichi notice you, right?

175
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,166
Then don't give up!

176
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:53,966
Right!

177
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,900
I won't let her
make it in time.

178
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:04,066
No matter what!

179
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,666
Oh!

180
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:21,133
What's wrong?

181
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,100
Don't look!

182
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:30,866
M-Move away from there, quick!

183
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,333
My shoe's caught
and I can't get it out!

184
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,000
- Then...
- Don't look!

185
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,633
I'm sorry!
Did it hurt?

186
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,100
Takuto!

187
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:50,833
Does it hurt?

188
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,766
No, I'm totally okay.

189
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,833
Good!
Just a little further.

190
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:55,466
Yeah!

191
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,033
I'm just getting started!

192
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,500
Mitsuki!

193
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,333
A-Are you okay?

194
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,333
Look at her face!

195
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,166
Meroko!

196
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,766
I'm seeing stars in front of me.

197
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,866
Are you okay?

198
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,200
Yeah, somehow.

199
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,933
- Huh?
- What?

200
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,666
No way!

201
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:25,766
Mitsuki!

202
00:16:35,466 --> 00:16:36,300
Takuto?

203
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,633
That was a close shave.

204
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,033
Oh no!

205
00:16:44,233 --> 00:16:45,633
Is this also TV?

206
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,833
There sure is a lot of filming!

207
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:50,966
Safe.

208
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:56,933
Think again.

209
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,233
It's Full Moon!

210
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:09,266
Full Moon is here!

211
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,166
What?! Full Moon?

212
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:13,500
Full Moon?

213
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,233
Then, the filming before was...

214
00:17:15,766 --> 00:17:16,600
O-Over there!

215
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,300
W-What should we do?!

216
00:17:18,766 --> 00:17:19,900
- Run!
- Okay!

217
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,200
This way!

218
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:32,833
An idol wouldn't be in here.

219
00:17:32,966 --> 00:17:34,666
But just in case...

220
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,633
We somehow shook them.

221
00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:46,233
Th-That over there!

222
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:46,933
Huh?

223
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,000
The studio is in that building.

224
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:50,133
Okay, let's hurry!

225
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,100
Oh, over there!

226
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,933
She's going into the building!

227
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:00,800
Have we been found?!

228
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,766
Wait up!

229
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,133
Hey! Wait!

230
00:18:15,066 --> 00:18:17,266
Man, thank goodness.

231
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:20,900
Oh!

232
00:18:24,466 --> 00:18:26,766
Oh... I-I'm sorry.

233
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:29,733
But...you see...

234
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:38,633
<i>I wonder if that'll be
my first kiss...</i>

235
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,933
<i>But, it wasn't unpleasant at all.</i>

236
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:50,866
Well, I'm sorry it was me!

237
00:18:50,966 --> 00:18:51,533
Huh?

238
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,400
Too bad it wasn't
a certain someone!

239
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,533
When you get right down to it,

240
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:58,200
it's your fault for collapsing
from shortness of breath.

241
00:18:58,366 --> 00:19:00,866
You...You don't have
to say it like that!

242
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:10,633
Well, don't worry about it.

243
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,566
That was just CPR.

244
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,433
Well... Umm...

245
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:18,666
It wasn't a kiss, so...
it won't be your first kiss.

246
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:24,966
It stopped?

247
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,900
Why?

248
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:27,733
When we only have
a little further to go!

249
00:19:31,966 --> 00:19:33,333
<i>Is this Meroko's doing?</i>

250
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,766
There's no way that
a half-baked Death Spirit can beat me.

251
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:48,866
I'm sorry.

252
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,866
I'm sorry for forcing a question
on you that you didn't want to be asked.

253
00:19:54,366 --> 00:19:55,633
Don't worry about it.

254
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,533
More importantly, don't give up.

255
00:19:57,933 --> 00:20:01,166
You've decided to keep at it
until Eichi notices you, right?!

256
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:02,133
Right.

257
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:05,533
But, we won't make it in time.

258
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,733
I'll get you there in time.

259
00:20:11,766 --> 00:20:12,433
What?

260
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:14,433
Meroko!

261
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,033
Go ahead and tell the Division Chief
of Death Spirits if you're going to!

262
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:20,266
No matter what happens,
I'm going to help this girl!

263
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:21,966
Got it?!

264
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,066
Takuto...

265
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:27,833
Let's go.

266
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:29,566
Okay!

267
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,233
How beautiful.

268
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:46,100
<i>Even if they're replicas,</i>

269
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:49,733
<i>even if they're not real,
they're really beautiful, Takuto.</i>

270
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:08,333
You'll be okay on your own
from here, right?

271
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:09,333
Right.

272
00:21:09,366 --> 00:21:10,666
Good! Get going!

273
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,566
Okay!

274
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,633
<i>Thank you very much for waiting.</i>

275
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:17,266
<i>And now for the announcement.</i>

276
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:20,766
<i>The Mermaid Tear image character</i>

277
00:21:21,233 --> 00:21:23,800
<i>will be Madoka Wakamatsu.</i>

278
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,233
No...

279
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:21,400
She couldn't make it
to the audition.

280
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:24,466
That means our assignment
was completed. And that's good, right?

281
00:23:24,766 --> 00:23:26,066
No, it's not!

282
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,900
What do you mean by that?
We've done enough!

283
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:32,100
It's not necessary to
do her any more favors.

284
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,366
No, not yet.

285
00:23:33,966 --> 00:23:36,066
She won't run away from
everything after this incident!

286
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:40,833
Singing is not something
she'll give up on so easily.

287
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,866
Next time on Full Moon:
"A Singer's Voice That Can't Be Heard."

288
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,600
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
