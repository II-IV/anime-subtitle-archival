1
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:07,433
Meet Mitsuki Koyama,
12 years old.

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,633
The other day,
a substitute for Ms. Oshige came.

3
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:12,766
But this guy was such a clumsy person.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,333
Everything he did was
full of mistakes!

5
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:16,266
Looks like Full Moon had a pretty
tough time

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,333
being dragged around
to all these places.

7
00:00:17,966 --> 00:00:19,166
At the end,
he quit his job as a manager,

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,966
so Mitsuki had to go all the way
to the train station to bring him back.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,933
I'm so exhausted from
being dragged around too.

10
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,633
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

11
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:33,633
Got that?

12
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:34,400
Yes.

13
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,233
Hey, Meroko.

14
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,966
Which sandals should I bring tomorrow?

15
00:02:18,533 --> 00:02:20,966
If I were you,
I think I'd go for the pink ones.

16
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:22,766
You think so too?

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,633
But the ones with ribbons are cute too.

18
00:02:25,866 --> 00:02:26,466
Aren't they?!

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,733
Well then, why don't you
take both of them?

20
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:30,666
You're right!

21
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,833
That's much better than
regretting it later!

22
00:02:32,866 --> 00:02:33,533
Sure!

23
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,033
It's work, right?

24
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,533
Then it doesn't matter which it is!

25
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:40,466
But it's my first overnight assignment!

26
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:42,200
It's totally not the same!

27
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:44,200
You really don't get it!

28
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:45,566
Okay, okay.

29
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,000
Fine, I don't get it at all.

30
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:51,266
Oh yes!
Takuto, you don't get it, do you?

31
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,400
Girls are always dreaming
of meeting a lovely prince!

32
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:57,533
Huh? A prince?

33
00:02:57,933 --> 00:03:00,700
For this prince that she might
meet at any moment,

34
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:04,300
girls always want to be
in their best attire.

35
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,566
Right, little Mitsuki?

36
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,033
"Little"?

37
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:11,766
Oh, that aside, I'm not staying home
when you're gone overnight, right?

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,966
Right, I told grandma that I'd be visiting
a summer house of my friend from school.

39
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:19,200
That's good.

40
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,133
After this much excitement,

41
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,500
- Is that how it is?
- if I were left behind,

42
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:25,333
I would cry!

43
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,900
<i>Her First Kiss?</i>

44
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:35,400
I'm taking off now.

45
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,300
Take care of yourself.

46
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:38,266
Okay!

47
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:39,633
Mitsuki.

48
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:42,133
Take this with you.

49
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,766
The letter is for your friend's parents.

50
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,066
Have the sweets with your friends.

51
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:51,666
Yes.

52
00:03:58,266 --> 00:04:02,066
<i>The path to love is too faraway.</i>

53
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,533
<i>I can't waste my time any longer.</i>

54
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,366
<i>- Non! Non!</i>
<i>- Non! Non!</i>

55
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,900
<i>In dreams it's a different world...</i>

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,433
<i>Wow... I'm going to be singing here.</i>

57
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:16,500
<i>I've seen this on TV,</i>

58
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:19,266
<i>but everyone in the audience</i>
<i>are actually in their swimsuits.</i>

59
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:25,266
<i>I can wear my favorite clothes every day.</i>

60
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,700
Hey, when is her turn coming?

61
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,700
I believe it'll be soon.

62
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,700
- No, I'm going to drown!
- H-Hey, Meroko!

63
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:40,400
I'll be drowning in
the stream of love!

64
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:42,433
Hey! Cut it out!

65
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:47,166
<i>Thank you so much.</i>
<i>That was THE SCANTY, everyone.</i>

66
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,166
<i>Next, as you all know, is Full Moon.</i>

67
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,933
<i>The song is "Myself."</i>

68
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:54,300
- <i>Here she is!</i>
- Hey, what are we gonna do this year?

69
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:56,433
Why don't we see how things
go for a little longer?

70
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:58,400
How many more are performing?

71
00:04:58,633 --> 00:04:59,633
Three more.

72
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,500
What? It's almost over?

73
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:05,166
So, let's do it when we are
done checking everyone.

74
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,500
That's true.

75
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:07,433
Be quiet!

76
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,933
What is it, Murakami?

77
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,900
<i>A distant place</i>

78
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:25,300
<i>was where I belonged.</i>

79
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,966
<i>I found a loneliness in</i>
<i>your eyes that day</i>

80
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,900
Hey, cut it out!

81
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,700
Meroko, it's her song!

82
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:36,466
Listen to it!

83
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,966
I'm listening!

84
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:39,766
You liar!

85
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:48,833
Good job.

86
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,333
Thank you, you too.

87
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,133
Let's work together again soon.

88
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:56,566
Oh yes, can you go ahead and
go back to the hotel first?

89
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,066
You know the place, yes?

90
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,966
Yes, it's that one, right?

91
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:03,733
Huh?

92
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:06,700
Oh, no... It's that one, right?

93
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:12,000
Since you have no sense of direction,
you most definitely have to take a taxi.

94
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,933
All right.

95
00:06:13,966 --> 00:06:15,866
All right, I'll catch up with you very soon.

96
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,133
Okay.

97
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,000
It's not that far away,

98
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:24,033
so once in a while,
maybe I should go for a little walk.

99
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:27,533
Yeah, she was talking like it's a big deal.
We can even see the hotel from here.

100
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,333
Yes.

101
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,000
Don't get lost after saying that, okay?

102
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:32,300
No no!

103
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:36,100
If she lives like a girl kept in cotton wool,
she won't even be able to fall in love!

104
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:36,866
Love?!

105
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,366
Yeah! When do you think this is?!

106
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,666
It's summer!
Summer is a season for love, isn't it?!

107
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:44,033
Right, Mitsuki?!

108
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,400
Oh?!

109
00:06:45,466 --> 00:06:47,400
Mitsuki! Where are you?

110
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,300
What a pleasant wind!

111
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,900
Oh, wait... There's a cute girl.

112
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:18,066
Good, good.

113
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:19,600
How about this girl then?

114
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,533
I'd say good, good, eh?

115
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:22,800
Where are you going?

116
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,233
Are you alone?

117
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,966
You've some time to spare, right?

118
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:27,933
Hey, play with us.

119
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,400
No...

120
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:32,500
What? What? What did you say?

121
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:34,033
I couldn't hear that!

122
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,833
Stop it.

123
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:36,933
It's all right!

124
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,933
Come on, come on, let's go.

125
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,866
No!

126
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,966
Mitsuki!

127
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:46,700
Come on, let's do something fun.

128
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,900
What? But...

129
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:49,966
It's your first time here, right?

130
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,966
We know a fun place to go.

131
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,500
Why don't we go there together?

132
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:54,866
What are you doing?!

133
00:07:55,966 --> 00:07:56,900
Oww!

134
00:07:56,933 --> 00:07:58,533
What are you doing, fooling around?

135
00:07:59,233 --> 00:08:02,100
Do you guys want to go through
the same thing you did the last time?

136
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:05,100
Damn! Why are you here?!

137
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,100
Crap! I'll remember this!

138
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:13,066
Are you okay?

139
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:13,966
What?!

140
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:16,333
Y-Yes, I'm fine!

141
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,433
Thank you very much!

142
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,033
It's unsafe for a girl to be walking alone.

143
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:22,033
I'll escort you home.

144
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:24,233
What? But I'm...I'm really fine!

145
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:25,633
Really?

146
00:08:25,966 --> 00:08:26,566
Huh?!

147
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:32,933
Okay.

148
00:08:34,566 --> 00:08:36,466
Well then, please.

149
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:38,766
What, what?!

150
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:40,833
Hey, that is looking good!

151
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:42,933
Like a good feeling for
something to start up, eh?

152
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,700
So, I'll take off here.

153
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,933
Thank you so much for escorting me!

154
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:57,800
I'd like to return this favor somehow.

155
00:08:58,466 --> 00:09:01,300
It wasn't a big deal.
I just did what anyone would do.

156
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,266
But...

157
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,266
Well, will you have
a cup of tea with me?

158
00:09:05,433 --> 00:09:05,866
What?

159
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:07,866
Well...

160
00:09:08,766 --> 00:09:09,533
Is it okay?

161
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:12,233
Yes...

162
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:14,866
Great! Shall we go then?

163
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Awesome, awesome!

164
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:18,766
Isn't it, Takuto?

165
00:09:18,866 --> 00:09:19,633
What?

166
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,766
Looks like it's gonna bud!
A love affair in a summer resort!

167
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,933
So wonderful.

168
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,866
<i>Once she has a boyfriend,</i>
<i>Takuto will be entirely mine!</i>

169
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:33,266
<i>I will totally back up their love!</i>

170
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:37,833
What?!

171
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,900
You were listening to today's show ?!

172
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:43,066
Yes, I was surprised by
how amazing the song was.

173
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:45,766
My heart is still pounding from it.

174
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:48,000
I feel a bit embarrassed.

175
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:50,800
Come on now!

176
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:54,233
Let's leave things to
the young ones here, and let's go. Yes?

177
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,666
Really?

178
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,400
So this Eichi is a really
important person to you.

179
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,566
Yes, I am singing to meet Eichi.

180
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:04,200
How romantic.

181
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:08,600
Just the fact that there is a girl with
such a pure heart like you, Full Moon,

182
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,333
makes me happy.

183
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:12,233
What?

184
00:10:13,466 --> 00:10:17,500
I want to help you find Eichi too.

185
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,200
Thank you.

186
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,100
You're so late!

187
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:33,000
Takuto?

188
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:36,466
What is it with that guy?
He was all over you.

189
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,566
Takuto, what are you talking about?

190
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:40,100
Yeah!

191
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,966
Don't ever see him again.

192
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,033
- Huh?
- Huh?

193
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:44,933
Why are you making such
a demand, Takuto?

194
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,633
Whatever, it doesn't matter!

195
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,033
Mr. Murakami is my friend, okay?

196
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:51,266
Are you telling me that
I can't make friends?

197
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,933
Beyond what I tell you,
you trust a stranger from out of nowhere?

198
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,833
Why are you saying such things?!

199
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:01,466
Mr. Murakami said that
he'd help me find Eichi!

200
00:11:01,766 --> 00:11:03,033
He's a really nice person!

201
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,400
Eichi again?

202
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:07,133
That's all you ever think about!

203
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:11,066
See! You get so mad
about me mentioning Eichi.

204
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,100
Mr. Murakami isn't like that!

205
00:11:13,366 --> 00:11:15,866
Oh really?
Well, I can't help being mad!

206
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,866
I'm completely different
from that guy, Murakami!

207
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,700
What's that?
Why are you so mad?!

208
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,900
Well, seems like I am no use in here.

209
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:24,800
Takuto!

210
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,800
Wait, Takuto! Where are you going?

211
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,100
Takuto! Takuto!

212
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,533
Jeez! What's he so mad about?

213
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,533
Mitsuki!

214
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,033
We have today off, so you can go out
and have fun today!

215
00:11:54,366 --> 00:11:55,133
Okay.

216
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,133
Hey, hey.

217
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,500
Don't you waste your day off!
You've got all my support!

218
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,533
Support for what?

219
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,033
It's okay. It's okay.

220
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:11,133
<i>Takuto didn't come back after all.</i>

221
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:13,833
<i>I wanted to make up with him.</i>

222
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:21,866
Such nice weather.

223
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,400
All right! Let's go look for
the guy from yesterday!

224
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:26,966
Huh? Who's yesterday's guy?

225
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,766
You forgot already?

226
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,466
It's Murakami, Murakami!

227
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,300
What?

228
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:33,366
Hey, nice to see you again.

229
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:34,933
Oh, Mr. Murakami...

230
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:36,533
Do you have the day off today?

231
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,366
Then I can give you
a little tour around this place.

232
00:12:39,566 --> 00:12:41,200
Would you like to ride on a yacht?

233
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:43,133
What?! A yacht?

234
00:12:49,866 --> 00:12:51,833
All right! Please take me there!

235
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:52,966
Really?!

236
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,166
Great! Then let's get going.

237
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,066
Okay.

238
00:13:11,766 --> 00:13:13,133
Wow!

239
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,733
Over there, you can see the Whale Rock.

240
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,800
And over there, you can see
a hazy Gekkou Island.

241
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:20,133
I see.

242
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,233
It looks so clear with this nice weather.

243
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,766
You must have brought it
with your good deeds.

244
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:27,400
Huh?

245
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:38,866
KASAI

246
00:13:57,266 --> 00:14:00,400
Takuto, they're out on the ocean now!

247
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,933
Finally, we are all alone!
Shall we enjoy our summer vacation?

248
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:07,466
Shall we?

249
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,000
What are you talking about?
We're working, aren't we?

250
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:12,900
Jeez, how boring.

251
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:16,233
What?!

252
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,100
THINGS TO BE WARY OF TODAY
- PORK BONE SOUP
- YACHTS
THAT IS ALL FOR TODAY

253
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,166
THINGS TO BE WARY OF TODAY
- PORK BONE SOUP
- YACHTS
THAT IS ALL FOR TODAY
No way!

254
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,966
Takuto! They were saying that
they'd be on a yacht, right?!

255
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,200
I forgot!

256
00:14:23,266 --> 00:14:26,500
What are you talking about?
The Handbook tells us to be on the yacht!

257
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:27,333
What?!

258
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:29,366
What?

259
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,433
Like I said, just wait! I'm almost there!

260
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,366
Are you sure?

261
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:39,266
If you can't kiss her before noon today,
your yacht is ours!

262
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,400
<i>I assure you that</i>
<i>it's going to work out!</i>

263
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,166
<i>There isn't a girl that</i>
<i>won't fall for me!</i>

264
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:46,000
Don't forget to film it for proof!

265
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,666
<i>I know! Talk to you later.</i>

266
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:49,466
All right.

267
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:52,400
That Murakami always does it.

268
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:56,300
Every single year, he picks up
young idols and makes them cry.

269
00:14:56,766 --> 00:14:58,800
Can't blame them for being
deceived by his looks.

270
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,200
Totally, he looks like
a perfectly innocent guy.

271
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:02,900
Yeah.

272
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,633
Wow, there are so many fish!

273
00:15:14,566 --> 00:15:16,100
How is it? Are you having fun?

274
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:16,966
Yes!

275
00:15:19,766 --> 00:15:24,033
I'm so happy to be spending time
with you alone.

276
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:28,966
Really? I am also happy because
it's the first time I've been on a yacht.

277
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:30,366
Great.

278
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,066
Anyhow, when are you leaving,
Full Moon?

279
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,200
Tomorrow, as soon as
I am done with work.

280
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,566
Oh, so I won't be able to see you again.

281
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm going to be so lonely.

282
00:15:43,466 --> 00:15:44,133
Oh...

283
00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:47,300
<i>Now she's mine.</i>

284
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:49,966
Oh...I found a shell!

285
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,366
Oh, so pretty.

286
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,866
Amazing! It's shining like a rainbow!

287
00:15:58,366 --> 00:16:00,466
Huh? Did something happen
to you, Mr. Murakami?

288
00:16:01,033 --> 00:16:03,900
No! Nothing! I'm totally fine!

289
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:10,900
Where are you, Mitsuki?!

290
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,366
She won't be able to hear you!

291
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:14,233
But what else can I do?

292
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,733
Just search around!

293
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,200
I'll look for her over there,
so you go that way!

294
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:19,066
Roger!

295
00:16:25,466 --> 00:16:27,933
<i>I have to hurry, it'll be noon soon.</i>

296
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,966
I don't want to let you go.

297
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:33,666
What?

298
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,066
Mr. Murakami?

299
00:16:36,966 --> 00:16:37,666
Full Moon...

300
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:39,533
Umm... That's a problem.

301
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,066
So kiss me!

302
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,600
What?!

303
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,033
I won't let you go back
unless you kiss me.

304
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,033
N-No way!

305
00:16:46,466 --> 00:16:48,666
I'm sorry. Please let me go back.

306
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,166
Full Moon!

307
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:51,066
Yes!

308
00:16:54,433 --> 00:16:55,400
Full Moon...

309
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,300
<i>What?! A kiss?</i>
<i>Mr. Murakami is trying to kiss me?!</i>

310
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,866
<i>Oh no. My first kiss is...</i>

311
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:13,333
Full Moon? Are you being shy?

312
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,533
You're so cute.

313
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,233
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

314
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:21,100
<i>Eichi!</i>

315
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:22,933
Full Moon...

316
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,266
Jeez, don't make me worry like this!

317
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:35,433
Takuto!

318
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,633
What are you doing?!
Didn't I tell you?

319
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,566
Don't trust a guy like this!

320
00:17:42,766 --> 00:17:43,500
I'm sorry.

321
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:55,533
Here!

322
00:17:58,466 --> 00:18:00,100
Take my hand! We're going back!

323
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:03,766
Okay!

324
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,866
Hold on tight, all right?!

325
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:07,933
Okay!

326
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,266
- Oh!
- Wow!

327
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:35,766
<i>Did I just bump into...</i>

328
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,900
<i>Her face...</i>

329
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,833
<i>Takuto's lips?</i>

330
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:49,533
There you are!

331
00:18:50,466 --> 00:18:51,500
Mitsuki!

332
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:53,533
Are you okay?!

333
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:54,433
Oh?

334
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,400
What? You were here already, Takuto?!

335
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,133
Whatever. Just help me down here!

336
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:01,100
Oh right. Here!

337
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,600
Hey, hey...

338
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:06,766
Don't tell me we have to
row from here on.

339
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:10,033
But I couldn't think of any other way.

340
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,600
Oh, here he comes!

341
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,700
He's really sound asleep.

342
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,800
Just leave him alone.

343
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,466
Is he okay?
Won't he catch a cold?

344
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:26,933
He'll be all right.

345
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,166
Murakami!

346
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,533
Hey, wake up, Murakami!

347
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:33,666
Who's she?

348
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:34,700
Don't know.

349
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,166
Where is this? Who am I?

350
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:40,366
What are you talking about!
You liar!

351
00:19:42,066 --> 00:19:42,833
Natsumi!

352
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:44,933
How dare you lie to me?

353
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:47,700
You said you'll never date another girl
again in your life!

354
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:49,766
That was...

355
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:53,400
Hey, you there!
Don't ever trust this guy.

356
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,366
What? What do you mean?

357
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,733
This jerk! He boasts that he can
have any idol that he lays his eyes on!

358
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:01,200
What?!

359
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:05,766
He doesn't even mind paying scumbags
to get them to bother girls!

360
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,566
Right?

361
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:07,900
What?! Right!

362
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:11,133
<i>Scumbags?! So those men were...</i>

363
00:20:12,966 --> 00:20:15,133
So that was a trap!

364
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,833
I bet you made a bet with your friends
that you'll be able to kiss her

365
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:20,066
before the end of the day
or something, didn't you?!

366
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:22,600
Is that true, Mr. Murakami?!

367
00:20:24,033 --> 00:20:26,266
What a jerk! A girl's enemy!

368
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,533
Mitsuki...

369
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,300
You're the worst jerk!

370
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:37,166
H-Hey!

371
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:38,366
Yikes!

372
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:40,866
You won't get away with it that easily!

373
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:48,800
H-Help! I can't swim!

374
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:50,400
How pathetic.

375
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,766
Good for him!

376
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:55,666
Girls are scary.

377
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:05,800
I believed that he was a nice person.

378
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:10,166
You trust people too easily, silly.

379
00:21:10,766 --> 00:21:11,833
What do you mean "silly"?!

380
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:18,800
I'm okay with that! I don't care
even if I get tricked.

381
00:21:19,233 --> 00:21:21,933
I don't want to be someone
who always doubts others.

382
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:23,733
Hey you!

383
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:31,933
Hey you! Are you listening to me?

384
00:21:31,966 --> 00:21:33,333
- Come on, it's okay.
- Shut up!

385
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,000
Hey, you little midget!

386
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,666
<i>That was an accident, right?</i>

387
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,000
<i>No! It was definitely an accident!</i>

388
00:23:18,766 --> 00:23:21,633
Oh, I can't stand it!
Who does she think she is?!

389
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,433
Why're you so worked up, Meroko?

390
00:23:23,566 --> 00:23:25,100
Do you remember Madoka Wakamatsu?

391
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:29,000
She lost to Mitsuki
in the Seed Records audition.

392
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,800
She's begun a serious rivalry
and she's so awful!

393
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,100
Hey, aren't we with her today?
Will things be okay?

394
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:36,900
Well, don't you worry.

395
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:39,400
Meroko here will be sure
to protect Mitsuki.

396
00:23:39,633 --> 00:23:42,100
That's the thing I'm most worried about.

397
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:45,633
Next time on Full Moon:
"The Rival Appears"

398
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,100
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
