1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,066
Meet Mitsuki Koyama,
12 years old.

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,633
Her debut single as Full Moon, "Myself"
has just been released.

3
00:00:10,966 --> 00:00:12,700
She was going to gather gossip
from her classmates and

4
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:15,100
see how they felt about the song,
but no one was talking about it!

5
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:17,033
She was really disappointed.

6
00:00:17,466 --> 00:00:19,000
But thanks to my help

7
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:21,100
she's been able to become friends
with her classmates,

8
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:23,066
and her single's become
the talk of the class.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,066
She was really happy
about that!

10
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:28,200
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

11
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,133
Got that?

12
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:35,033
Yes.

13
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:23,900
Mitsuki, who's coming
from your house?

14
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,233
My grandmother was
supposed to come,

15
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:30,633
but she caught a cold and
she's been in bed since this morning.

16
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:32,633
So nobody's going to come.

17
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,766
Oh, really.

18
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,966
Who?

19
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:38,066
What?

20
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:39,533
That can't be.

21
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:42,600
It's...Oji?!

22
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,700
What?

23
00:02:43,966 --> 00:02:46,800
Don't you remember?
"Route L"?

24
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:47,733
Oji!

25
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:51,533
Who is that?
He's really handsome!

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,600
Dr. Wakaoji...

27
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:58,333
Dr. Wakaoji really stands out
when you see him in a place like this.

28
00:02:58,366 --> 00:02:59,400
Couldn't stand out more.

29
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,066
Boy, it stinks of make-up in here.

30
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:20,900
Mitsuki.

31
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,566
Doctor...
What are you doing here?

32
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,366
Today, when I made a house call
at your grandmother's,

33
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,766
I heard that it's your class
visitation day.

34
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:30,900
She let me come in her place.

35
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:31,900
Thank you.

36
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:33,866
Who's that?
Your father, Mitsuki?

37
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,866
How could you not tell us that
your father was so good looking?

38
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,366
No...that's not it.

39
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:40,033
No?

40
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,900
Dr. Wakaoji is my father's friend.

41
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:45,533
Oh, I see.

42
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:48,766
I guess me playing the role of
your father maybe annoying to you...

43
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:50,033
No way!

44
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,733
Don't be silly.

45
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,866
I think you're standing out
a little too much though.

46
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:57,100
Huh?

47
00:03:58,633 --> 00:03:59,933
He looked this way!

48
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,333
Oji!

49
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:07,200
ALWAYS BE CHEERFUL,
AND GIVE A SPIRITED GREETING.

50
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:15,066
Dr. Wakaoji, I heard stories but,
you're really popular, aren't you?

51
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:18,133
Oh no, that's an old story.

52
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:20,966
I was kind of proud today.

53
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,633
<i>Next up is the song we're
highlighting this month.</i>

54
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:27,366
<i>It's looking to become
a runaway hit!</i>

55
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,233
<i>It's "Myself" by Full Moon.</i>

56
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,500
<i>Why do I like you so much?</i>

57
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:39,966
<i>My tears are falling...</i>

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,966
She said it's a big hit!
See? Just like I said.

59
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:45,200
Huh? Shhh!

60
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:55,866
Yes! This is Wakaoji.

61
00:04:56,566 --> 00:05:01,066
Ah, what? Just when Mitsuki's song
was playing.

62
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:04,233
He got a phone call.
It can't be helped.

63
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,300
Yes...yes...

64
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,466
Yes, the academic conference
at the Tauji Hotel tomorrow.

65
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:11,100
Mitsuki, play the CD.

66
00:05:11,566 --> 00:05:12,166
Okay.

67
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:14,966
Yes, I'm looking forward to it.

68
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:18,800
Doctor?

69
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:21,733
Do you want to listen to music?
See, this.

70
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:26,266
Oh, sorry, this car doesn't
have a CD player.

71
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:32,166
Well... take this home!
And please listen to it at your house.

72
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,800
It looks good, doesn't it?

73
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,133
Sorry...

74
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,033
I...uh...don't listen to things
like this much.

75
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:48,233
I'm an old man now, you know.

76
00:05:48,366 --> 00:05:53,766
Don't say that, listen to it and see.
I think it's a good song.

77
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:54,566
Really...

78
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:58,200
Mitsuki, so you like that
song that much?

79
00:05:58,866 --> 00:05:59,733
Y-Yeah.

80
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,700
If I were to become a singer,

81
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:06,000
this is the kind of song
I'd like to be able to sing.

82
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:11,366
That's why I want you to hear it,
to see what you think.

83
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,466
I see Mitsuki, you want to be a singer.
That's right, you've always said that.

84
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:18,500
Yes.

85
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:24,433
By the way,
about your class visitation today.

86
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,800
I've never done that before
and I was really nervous.

87
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,066
Humph!

88
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:35,266
Uh...

89
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:38,600
Mitsuki? What's wrong?

90
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:39,933
Nothing.

91
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:42,800
I wonder what happened.

92
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:44,900
Stupid.

93
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,733
Thank you for taking the trouble
to come to school today.

94
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:51,900
Mitsuki!

95
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:55,900
Sorry, did I say something bad?

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,200
No...nothing.

97
00:06:58,533 --> 00:06:59,900
Ah...okay...

98
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,366
Hey, if there's something you want
to say to me, won't you say it?

99
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,000
There's nothing.

100
00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:07,266
Ah...okay...

101
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:11,400
That's right, he's cold.
No reason to talk to him!

102
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:15,466
Doctor, you're good looking,
tall and intelligent, and...

103
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:18,200
perfect. I have no complaints.

104
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:19,333
Mitsuki...

105
00:07:24,433 --> 00:07:28,233
An old man like me can't understand
the feelings of a young girl!

106
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:36,600
Grandmother, I brought you
some porridge.

107
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:39,266
Oh, thank you.

108
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,600
You must be hungry, Gran-

109
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,833
<i>That's...the radio in Ms. Tanaka's room!</i>

110
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,100
Mitsuki...

111
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,000
Y-Yes?

112
00:07:57,066 --> 00:07:59,800
It's noisy. Please go and turn it off.

113
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:00,833
Y-Yes.

114
00:08:04,766 --> 00:08:07,633
Whew, I got nervous...

115
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,900
Ms. Tanaka?

116
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:17,166
Mitsuki?

117
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,400
Your earphone's unplugged.

118
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:20,566
Huh?!

119
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,366
We can hear everything.

120
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,266
Oh my...

121
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,833
Sorry, sorry.

122
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,566
Mitsuki, you have work today!

123
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,133
Yep.

124
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,866
Yaaay, we're going out, we're going out!

125
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,833
That physician... Is he coming
to pick you up?

126
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,833
No, I haven't contacted him.

127
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:53,600
<i>Sorry, I...uh...don't listen
to things like this much.</i>

128
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,733
What?! What does that mean?

129
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:57,566
Meroko, you're staying home.

130
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,000
Are you serious?
I don't want to... It's boring.

131
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,166
I don't feel Mitsuki
is this kind of type...

132
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,766
Hm? "Normally quiet children
tend to..." What's this?

133
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,766
Special Feature,
"A Father's Words to His Daughter."

134
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:22,866
Uh-huh, uh-huh...
I could cry!

135
00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:29,833
What?! It can't be...not that...
No...not Mitsuki. Not that!

136
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:34,066
For future reference...just in case...

137
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:40,500
Ah! No!
For future reference...

138
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,200
Ah! I'm bored!
I can't take it anymore.

139
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:53,133
Thanks for the great work today!

140
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,200
Good job, everybody...

141
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:57,166
Okay, pull out, pull out.
Good work.

142
00:09:57,866 --> 00:10:00,066
You've gotten pretty used
to interviews, haven't you?

143
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,266
Way to go.

144
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:01,766
Yes.

145
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:06,133
Hey, what do you think this is?

146
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:09,166
What is it?

147
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:12,633
It means we've got
a runaway hit!

148
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,633
I see, it's selling.

149
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,633
What happened?
Aren't you happy?

150
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,200
Huh? No, that's not it.

151
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,366
You look kind of down.

152
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,933
No, I'm okay.

153
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,800
I see! So it's selling.

154
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:37,100
Well, I'm going this way.
Be careful on your way home.

155
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,466
Okay, thanks for everything!

156
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:48,466
You're thinking about it,
aren't you?

157
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,300
About what?

158
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:53,166
What do you mean, what?
It's written on your face.

159
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:58,733
"I'm lonely because the physician and
my grandmother won't listen to my song."

160
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,233
"I'm depressed."

161
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:01,566
What? Really!

162
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,100
Stupid, that's not what I meant.

163
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,633
It's a big hit, right?

164
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:14,133
Yeah...but I...want the people close to me
to be happy for me.

165
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:20,666
I auditioned with my father's song,
I succeeded, and became a singer.

166
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:24,666
But Dr. Wakaoji,
who once also pursued music,

167
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,133
won't listen to it.

168
00:11:27,366 --> 00:11:31,833
Somehow it feels like my father
doesn't acknowledge it either...

169
00:11:32,766 --> 00:11:34,066
I think it's good.

170
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,300
You have a nice voice and
you worked so hard to write the lyrics.

171
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:41,700
That's true but...

172
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:42,533
I assure you.

173
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:45,600
W-What is it?

174
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:51,133
Takuto, you don't know much about music,
so you can say that so easily.

175
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,766
Uh...I'm sorry I said too much.

176
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:00,200
Um...

177
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:03,433
I'm going home.

178
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,333
- I...
- Huh?

179
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,200
I...used to be a musician, long ago.

180
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,166
What?!

181
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,066
Daddy, over there.

182
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,833
Wait for me.

183
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,233
Takuto...
What did you just say?

184
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,666
Long ago, I used to be a musician.

185
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:47,866
Huh? Long ago?

186
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:50,866
When I was a human, I sang songs, too.

187
00:12:51,266 --> 00:12:54,266
What? Takuto, you were a human?!

188
00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:57,633
Hmph!
I wasn't born a Death Spirit.

189
00:12:57,966 --> 00:13:00,500
What?! No way, really?!

190
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,666
Well, what about Meroko?
Was Meroko a human, too?

191
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:06,066
I don't really know,
but it seems so...

192
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,433
Is that so?

193
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:12,666
Sorry, I...said that you don't know
anything about music.

194
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:14,766
It's okay, don't worry about it.

195
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:17,966
Let's go!

196
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,000
What? Where?

197
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,666
You want him to hear
your song, don't you?

198
00:13:24,366 --> 00:13:27,900
Dr. Wakaoji is out at
an academic conference today.

199
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,633
Yes, yes...

200
00:13:30,966 --> 00:13:33,533
She says he's at a conference.
Now that I think of it...

201
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:36,966
<i>Yes, the academic conference
at the Tauji Hotel tomorrow...</i>

202
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:39,033
Okay, on to the Tauji Hotel!

203
00:13:39,066 --> 00:13:40,933
Ah...wait!

204
00:13:40,966 --> 00:13:42,433
Hm? I'm wrong?!

205
00:13:42,466 --> 00:13:45,966
Yes, I'm sure he said that he had
something special to take care of

206
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,600
so he was looking for someone
to go in his place.

207
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:01,133
There's no sight of him.

208
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,900
No...

209
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:06,800
I think it would annoy him if
I burst in on him at a place like this.

210
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,733
You won't know
unless you do it, right?!

211
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:14,400
But...if he listens to it and
says that he really hates it.

212
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:15,466
What will I do?

213
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,733
Oh, Come on!
Stop being wishy washy.

214
00:14:17,766 --> 00:14:20,233
Take the bull by its horns!
Be more confident.

215
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:21,700
Yes, that's right!

216
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:23,166
Meroko!

217
00:14:23,466 --> 00:14:24,500
What are you doing?!

218
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:29,966
Well, you two always go out together.
It's boring all alone.

219
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,633
Yeah, but...

220
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,400
No problem.

221
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:37,333
That old lady hasn't recovered from her cold
and she's been in bed all day,

222
00:14:37,366 --> 00:14:38,800
so we won't be found out.

223
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,866
That's it.

224
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:50,100
Which way are you going?

225
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:53,133
Uh...to Dr. Wakaoji.

226
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:56,100
I'm very sorry, but we're asking
unauthorized parties

227
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:58,566
to please refrain from
entering the conference area.

228
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:04,166
Sheesh!
To get stuck at a place like this.

229
00:15:04,633 --> 00:15:06,400
And we came this far...

230
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,533
I know! I'll make Dr. Wakaoji
listen to the CD!

231
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,766
Huh? Wait!

232
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:14,533
Meroko! Not again!

233
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,533
Well, we want him to hear it, right?

234
00:15:17,966 --> 00:15:19,533
Meroko!

235
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:22,666
Where are you going?

236
00:15:23,766 --> 00:15:25,200
Takuto, what should I do?

237
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,000
This should work.

238
00:15:29,066 --> 00:15:32,500
Where did that Meroko go?

239
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:33,966
I can't believe her.

240
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:37,100
It's Meroko!

241
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,866
I never heard you say
anything about that!

242
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,633
No, I'm sure of it!

243
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,633
Hey, porter.

244
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:51,900
There's strange...er, nice music
in the academic conference room.

245
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,133
Let's go see.

246
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:53,766
Yeah!

247
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:55,566
Here's our chance!

248
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,333
It's nice to have background music
like this once in a while.

249
00:16:04,366 --> 00:16:05,700
I wonder where he is?

250
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,533
I don't see him anywhere.

251
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,733
Hurry, let's go confirm it.

252
00:16:11,766 --> 00:16:12,266
Yeah.

253
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:15,133
I wonder what that was
just now.

254
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,700
It's probably
a complimentary service.

255
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:20,233
Umm, excuse me,
is Dr. Wakaoji here?

256
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:24,100
Oh, Dr. Wakaoji?
He didn't come today...

257
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:24,600
What?!

258
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:26,533
Where did he go?

259
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:29,600
How about it?
It went perfectly today, right?!

260
00:16:29,633 --> 00:16:32,533
Huh? Yeah. If that physician
had been here.

261
00:16:32,566 --> 00:16:35,366
What? He isn't here?
Owww.

262
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,200
Huh?

263
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,166
Do you know where he is?

264
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,700
Yep.

265
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,100
Umm...

266
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,333
This is...

267
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,833
Does it look familiar?

268
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:00,800
Yeah.

269
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,833
It seems like I've been here
once before.

270
00:17:03,866 --> 00:17:04,800
I see...

271
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,033
<i>What is...this feeling?</i>

272
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:10,466
Oh!

273
00:17:16,533 --> 00:17:18,066
Dr. Wakaoji!

274
00:17:39,566 --> 00:17:42,733
It's been 10 years since
you passed away.

275
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,400
Your daughter is already 12 years old.

276
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,300
She's becoming a teen from head to toe,
and she's started to look like Hazuki...

277
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:56,166
<i>This is where...Mother and Father...</i>

278
00:17:56,666 --> 00:18:00,600
I think all this time I've been running away
from your death.

279
00:18:02,066 --> 00:18:04,766
Every time I see Mitsuki,
who's starting to look like Hazuki,

280
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,433
I feel like I'm called back
to those days.

281
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:12,566
And it really pains me.

282
00:18:13,466 --> 00:18:17,100
But, Mitsuki is beginning to walk
toward the future.

283
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:21,533
It seems I can't dwell on the past anymore.

284
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:27,133
I have to get over your deaths.

285
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:34,366
I've sealed music away for a long time.

286
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:35,233
What?!

287
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:41,133
<i>I...uh...don't listen to things like this much.
I'm an old man, you know.</i>

288
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:43,933
<i>Those words that time...</i>

289
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,700
<i>I see Mitsuki, you want to be a singer.
That's right, you've always said that.</i>

290
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,400
<i>You've always said that.</i>

291
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:58,800
I thought I'd never listen
to music again...

292
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,133
Your daughter says
she wants to be a singer...

293
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,333
There's no doubt
that she's your daughter.

294
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:12,133
I'll watch your daughter grow up,
in your place.

295
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,100
Please cheer her on with me.

296
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:20,800
He's coming this way.

297
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:38,433
Huh?

298
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:46,900
<i>I-It can't be...</i>

299
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,533
<i>Dr. Wakaoji...Thank you.</i>

300
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:19,766
Father, Mother...I've made my debut.
Please cheer me on.

301
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:24,900
I'll work very hard.

302
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:33,500
Is Dr. Wakaoji here?

303
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,233
Oh! Mitsuki.

304
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,233
Doctor, uh...

305
00:20:37,466 --> 00:20:38,166
Sorry!

306
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,800
I have an urgent patient.
I'll be back soon!

307
00:20:42,566 --> 00:20:45,066
Aww...you're always busy.

308
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,266
I wonder if he sits here...

309
00:20:53,433 --> 00:20:56,633
Doctor...
You bought it.

310
00:20:57,566 --> 00:20:59,566
Sorry...
I made you wait.

311
00:21:00,266 --> 00:21:01,033
What?

312
00:21:01,633 --> 00:21:02,600
Mitsuki...

313
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,566
I guess she went home.
She must have...

314
00:21:14,966 --> 00:21:17,866
<i>Thank you for coming
to my classroom visitation.</i>

315
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,000
<i>I was kind of embarrassed
but, in truth, I was really happy.</i>

316
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:30,400
<i>Please continue to be my surrogate father
from now on. Yours, Mitsuki.</i>

317
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,266
I wonder if the doctor read my card.

318
00:23:25,466 --> 00:23:27,933
What are you doing Meroko?
Laughing like that all by yourself!?!

319
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:30,566
But Takuto,
how can you not be happy?

320
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:32,733
We're at a TV station...TV!

321
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:35,766
Everywhere you look,
there's famous people!

322
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,633
Darn it, you know we're
here as her chaperones.

323
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:40,400
But look, even Mitsuki's...

324
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:45,566
Ahh...both of you are so starstruck!
Are you sure this is going to be okay?

325
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:49,166
Next time on Full Moon:
"The Rules of Show Business"

326
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,033
- Don't miss it!
- Don't miss it!
