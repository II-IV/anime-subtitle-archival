1
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:08,533
Meet Mitsuki Koyama, 12 years old.
Her dream is to become a singer.

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,333
She did great at her audition
and is on her way to becoming a star,

3
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:13,933
but her debut song was up in the air,

4
00:00:13,966 --> 00:00:16,000
and she had a disagreement
with her producer

5
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:18,733
and she told him that she'd
write her own song lyrics.

6
00:00:18,866 --> 00:00:21,233
But everything worked out

7
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:24,500
and soon she'll be making
her debut as "Full Moon."

8
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,766
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

9
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:33,566
Got that?

10
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:34,733
Yes.

11
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,433
Meroko, you look like
you're really happy!

12
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,466
Of course, I have to take
good care of my skin.

13
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:29,333
It seems like you're happy too.

14
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:31,000
What, you think so?

15
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,266
Oh...debuting as Full Moon...

16
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,366
I'm so happy that
it doesn't seem real.

17
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,333
Oh, it's Ms. Oshige!

18
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,266
<i>H-Hello.</i>

19
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:48,666
Oh, Mitsuki?

20
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:49,500
Yes.

21
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:51,133
<i>I'm sorry it's last minute,</i>

22
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,500
<i>but we have a photo shoot
for a magazine.</i>

23
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,600
A photo shoot?

24
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:58,933
<i>That's right, and tomorrow
we're meeting at 9 in the morning.</i>

25
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,233
What? Tomorrow?!

26
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:06,566
<i>Her First Assignment</i>

27
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:13,400
A photo shoot at the lake,

28
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:15,700
it's been a while since
I've been to a lake.

29
00:03:16,466 --> 00:03:18,300
Why are you getting excited?

30
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,733
In any case, did you contact
that doctor of yours?

31
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:24,700
Yeah. When I told him that
I was going to the lake,

32
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:27,500
he said that it'd be good for my body,
so he was happy.

33
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,266
I see.

34
00:03:28,366 --> 00:03:28,966
Yeah...

35
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:30,366
That's right!

36
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:31,033
Huh?

37
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,966
I should bring my bathing suit too.

38
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:37,300
Hey, don't forget your job
as a Death Spirit!

39
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:39,300
Oh, I know already!

40
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:41,333
Are you sure about that?

41
00:03:57,033 --> 00:03:59,266
Wow! The air tastes so different!

42
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,033
Ms. Oshige,
can I go take a short walk?

43
00:04:03,466 --> 00:04:05,500
Sure! But come back soon!

44
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:06,833
All right!

45
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,300
Hey, hey!

46
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,266
Where do you think you're going,
leaving us here!

47
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,433
I'm going to the lake, too!

48
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,200
Oh... Here it is, here it is.

49
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:23,033
There's no time for the lake!

50
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:23,966
Oh c'mon, it's ok!

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I could never go on field trips
because I was always sick.

52
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,833
Yeah! It feels so good!

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,233
It feels so good to be able
to shout out loud.

54
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,066
She's so stupid.

55
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,066
Takuto!

56
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,166
Huh? What?

57
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,666
Don't be so silly!

58
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:09,133
You better remember what
you told me last night.

59
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:10,133
Last night?

60
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:14,400
We can't let her meet the person
who's going to change her destiny.

61
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:16,666
I know that!

62
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:19,133
More importantly,
you should get your act together!

63
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:21,533
It's not like we're on a field trip!

64
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,900
That's none of your concern!

65
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,700
Didn't we tell you not
to leave us behind?

66
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,766
What would we do
if something happened?

67
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,166
What do you mean "something"?

68
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,833
What? I mean...

69
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,633
Well, what if they found out that
you were actually 12!

70
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:44,100
No need to worry about that, see?

71
00:05:44,366 --> 00:05:46,300
They're not going to find out
with me like this.

72
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:48,700
Mitsuki!

73
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:53,400
We're going to start soon,
so come back!

74
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:55,033
All right!

75
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,333
Then let's start, shall we?

76
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:03,266
Please be good to her.

77
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:06,200
Those are very cute stuffed animals.

78
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,600
Are they yours, Miss Full Moon?

79
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:10,666
Yes, they're my very good friends.

80
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:12,000
I see.

81
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:14,700
My name is Takeda and I'm from
the monthly magazine MYOJO.

82
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:16,200
Nice to meet you

83
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:19,000
Monthly magazine MYOJO?

84
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:23,500
<i>It's that magazine with
all the famous singers.</i>

85
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,233
Mitsuki...

86
00:06:27,366 --> 00:06:28,166
Wow! Awesome!

87
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,233
Mitsuki!

88
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,633
What?! Oh, yes!

89
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,966
You have to introduce yourself!

90
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,566
Oh! I-I'm Full Moon!
Nice to meet you!

91
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:38,700
I'm sorry. It's just the way she is...

92
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,700
She's much cuter than I imagined.

93
00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:44,266
Um, you're a high school student, right?

94
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:46,400
Yes, I'm 16!

95
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:51,666
My blood type is A, my hobby is reading,
and my favorite color is blue.

96
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:53,900
That's right, keep it up.

97
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:55,733
It was totally worth it
for her to have practiced!

98
00:06:55,766 --> 00:06:56,833
Are you sure about that?

99
00:06:57,033 --> 00:07:00,500
On my days off, I usually relax at home!

100
00:07:01,033 --> 00:07:04,266
And I usually like
to hang out with myself!

101
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,266
You're a funny person!

102
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,433
Well yes...

103
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,166
I'm sorry!
I have to leave just for a second.

104
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,500
But please carry on without me.

105
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:19,900
It's fine!

106
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,066
This is your first interview,
so do your best!

107
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:26,666
Oh, yeah!

108
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,733
Hmm...my next question would be...

109
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,200
When did you decide that
you wanted to become a singer?

110
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:37,766
Since I was ten!

111
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:41,733
You have such clear answers.

112
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:45,033
Was there an episode that
triggered this?

113
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:45,766
What?!

114
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,066
So you can see Eichi again, right?

115
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,333
But that's...

116
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,300
Oh?

117
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,566
Is something the matter?

118
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:59,166
Oh? Nothing!
U-Umm...

119
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:03,433
It's so that I can have
many people listen to me sing.

120
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:04,633
I see...

121
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,400
Are there any singers
that you aspire to be like?

122
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:09,133
What?!

123
00:08:09,566 --> 00:08:11,900
Oh no! We didn't practice that one!

124
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:15,933
What's the matter?
Maybe you don't have any?

125
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:17,266
U-Umm...

126
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:20,200
I like anybody
who is a great singer.

127
00:08:22,466 --> 00:08:24,333
Maybe the question was too boring.

128
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:27,266
Then, what are your favorite foods?

129
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,166
Taiyaki and the shrimp pilaf that
comes with the school-provided lunches.

130
00:08:31,266 --> 00:08:32,733
Huh? School-provided lunches.

131
00:08:34,266 --> 00:08:35,133
Fool!

132
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:36,866
School-provided lunch?

133
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:39,866
Miss Full Moon, you said that
you were a high school student, correct?

134
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,933
Your school offers lunches?

135
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:43,200
That's not what I meant...

136
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:46,333
Um... I meant the shrimp pilaf
I used to have in elementary school

137
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:49,000
was so unforgettably my favorite!

138
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,933
Maybe Miss Full Moon, you actually
are an elementary school student.

139
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:57,866
<i>Did he figure me out?</i>

140
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,433
I'm just kidding!

141
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:03,066
Don't let it bother you.

142
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,500
Oh, y-yes.

143
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:10,966
I'll have to make her practice more.

144
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,600
It's getting complicated

145
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:15,933
because you're giving her
unnecessary information.

146
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:16,966
What?!

147
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,233
<i>I have to be more careful.</i>

148
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,733
<i>I have to look and
act like a sixteen-year-old.</i>

149
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,600
<i>I wonder if I look mature enough?</i>

150
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:47,833
Can you walk around a little bit for me?

151
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,133
Y-Yes!

152
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,000
Then, try lifting your arms a little bit.

153
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,333
What?! Oh...

154
00:09:59,466 --> 00:09:59,966
Yes!

155
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,933
Um, do you think you can try
being a little more natural?

156
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:04,600
What?!

157
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,166
I'm sorry.

158
00:10:10,766 --> 00:10:16,166
Even so, he should take into consideration
that she's still a novice at this!

159
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:18,533
Then, next look over to the lake!

160
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,933
As if you're looking at
somewhere far away!

161
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,266
O-Okay...

162
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,700
<i>I have to act like a sixteen-year-old!</i>

163
00:10:28,466 --> 00:10:29,666
No, no!

164
00:10:29,866 --> 00:10:31,866
This won't be any good!

165
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,133
We'll take a break!

166
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:01,900
I'm so sorry...

167
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:03,166
When he gets in that mood,

168
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,666
no matter who's around,
he gets like that.

169
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,400
No...

170
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:10,333
Our girl's still new and she hasn't gotten
used to these things either.

171
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:13,633
Well, it's getting cloudy,
so let's take a short break.

172
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:20,233
Mitsuki...

173
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,833
I'm sorry.

174
00:11:23,966 --> 00:11:26,966
Don't worry about it!
Work at your own pace.

175
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:28,633
But...

176
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:32,066
Maybe you should go
walk around a bit?

177
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:33,866
You still have some time.

178
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,300
Go on. It'll make you feel better.

179
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:41,533
Okay.

180
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,200
That fool.
What is she getting all tense for?

181
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,533
That's not it!

182
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:50,133
It's because of that
incompetent cameraman pressuring her!

183
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:53,400
If I were taking the pictures,
I'd take such beautiful pictures of her!

184
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,366
You're right, he's not able
to capture her beauty.

185
00:11:57,566 --> 00:11:58,233
Huh?

186
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,133
Capture her beauty?

187
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,900
Oh! What beauty?!

188
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:04,766
When you already have
somebody like me!

189
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:06,800
Make up your mind already!

190
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,800
It doesn't matter!

191
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:10,466
Takuto, you can't look
at that girl any more!

192
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:12,833
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?!

193
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:16,766
Now, back to work, back to work!

194
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,933
- Hey, Meroko take it off!
- Umm...let's see...

195
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:22,400
The key word is
"High School Girl"?

196
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:23,466
- What is this?
- Hey! Take it off!

197
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:25,500
- Are there any here?
- Hey! Do something!

198
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:46,833
I'm a little tired.

199
00:12:56,666 --> 00:13:00,500
I wonder what would happen if
they found out I'm really 12?

200
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:03,466
Could they stop me from debuting?

201
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,433
If that happens, I won't
be able to see Eichi.

202
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:12,700
I have to do my best.

203
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:15,966
<i>What made you want to
become a singer?</i>

204
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:20,733
It's so that Eichi will find me...

205
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,600
That's right,
that's why I'm going to become a singer!

206
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,233
<i>The only thing that doesn't change;</i>

207
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,566
<i>My dream that I've been holding.</i>

208
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,366
<i>How do I appear now</i>

209
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:51,500
<i>to those young eyes from the past?</i>

210
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:56,100
<i>Hey! Look above you!</i>

211
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,000
<i>Upon the wide night sky</i>

212
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:12,266
<i>I'll shine with all my might.</i>

213
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,466
<i>So hurry up and find the full moon.</i>

214
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:20,866
<i>Let's sing a song</i>

215
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:27,533
<i>I can bear any hardship
when I'm always together with you.</i>

216
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,866
<i>More and more—</i>

217
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,500
<i>I wanna be closer and closer to you</i>

218
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:37,466
<i>even though you are already here.</i>

219
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,166
<i>Many thanks for you!</i>

220
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,100
U-Umm...

221
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:50,433
Who are you?

222
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:51,300
What?

223
00:14:51,466 --> 00:14:53,866
We heard such a beautiful voice,

224
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,666
so we came over trying to figure out
what was going on.

225
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,466
Then we saw you singing your heart out,
we were so surprised.

226
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,933
Oh, I'm sorry.

227
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,900
No need to apologize.

228
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,666
But, you really do have
a beautiful voice...

229
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:08,800
Hey, what are you doing
in a place like this?

230
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,200
What?! In a place like this?!

231
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,500
Could it be that you believe in
the "16-year-old's hill"?

232
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,300
The 16-year-old's hill?

233
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,933
Oh, no?

234
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,966
Darn...

235
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,766
We call this hill the "16-year-old hill,"

236
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:30,033
and it's thought that if you come here
on your 16th birthday,

237
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:33,300
you'll have a boyfriend that year!

238
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:36,833
And it's actually At-chan's birthday!

239
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:37,766
Yeah!

240
00:15:37,933 --> 00:15:40,333
So that's why we came here today.

241
00:15:41,633 --> 00:15:42,633
<i>Boyfriend?!</i>

242
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,866
<i>Boyfriend...huh...</i>

243
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,100
<i>Then when I turn 16...</i>

244
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:50,966
<i>Oh...</i>

245
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:55,566
<i>That's right, my 16th birthday
won't ever come.</i>

246
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:57,866
<i>Oh!</i>

247
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,066
Where did that girl go?

248
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,666
And I don't see any high school students.

249
00:16:03,933 --> 00:16:06,400
Oh? This cell phone...
it's the newest model, isn't it?

250
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:07,700
Huh? What?

251
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,466
This one has games!

252
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:10,600
Games?

253
00:16:10,966 --> 00:16:11,800
You don't know?

254
00:16:12,033 --> 00:16:12,800
Yeah...

255
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,733
See!

256
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:16,300
Oh, yeah!

257
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,700
Once in a while, you'll bump into
high school students

258
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:21,866
who don't even know
how to use cell phones!

259
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:23,766
Could you be talking about me?!

260
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,033
Maybe you don't even know
how to text message?

261
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:28,533
Text message?

262
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:32,133
Just as I thought!
I had a hunch!

263
00:16:32,433 --> 00:16:35,433
<i>Maybe it's because I'm only 12...</i>

264
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,933
Oh, by the way...
how old are you?

265
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:40,333
12.

266
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,900
What?!

267
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:42,800
Oh?!

268
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,066
NO way!

269
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,000
I thought you were around
the same age as us,

270
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:47,233
like 16 or something.

271
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:48,300
Oh! That's right!

272
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,266
You're right! I actually am 16!

273
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,800
You have to be.
There's no way that you could be 12.

274
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,233
Oh! Trying to fool us with your age!

275
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:02,066
<i>What a relief!</i>

276
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,100
<i>They said that I look like a 16-year-old.</i>

277
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,533
Hey, then do you want me
to teach you how to text?

278
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:09,666
Yeah!

279
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,633
Then let's exchange numbers.

280
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,000
Oh!

281
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:16,400
There she is!

282
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:18,933
More importantly,
I see high school students!

283
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:19,933
This isn't good!

284
00:17:20,466 --> 00:17:21,833
Hey, you guys!

285
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:22,533
Oh?!

286
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,766
Move away from Mitsuki!

287
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,133
Meroko!
What are you doing?!

288
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,466
My job!

289
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:34,300
What?!

290
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,033
Ohh! What's going on?!

291
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:38,533
Meroko!

292
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,333
What are you doing in a place like this?

293
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:46,366
It says "High School Student"
as a key word!

294
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:47,500
It does?

295
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,900
That's why I'm trying to
get them to go away!

296
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:53,166
- Meroko...
- What is it?!

297
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,333
This!

298
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,633
Except those with loose socks.

299
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,533
Really?!
Oh... What was that wind just now?!

300
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:05,733
- Oh...that was scary!
- My hair is totally messy now!

301
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,500
Oops!

302
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:13,700
Oh, it's already time!

303
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:14,666
What, no way!

304
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,766
We have to get back now.

305
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,366
What? Oh, ok!

306
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,566
Then, see you again!

307
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,733
Oh, see you again!

308
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,966
Hope to see you soon!

309
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,333
I'll text message you sometime soon!

310
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,366
Ok!

311
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:32,266
Thanks...

312
00:18:33,466 --> 00:18:37,066
Hey! I'm going to make
my debut as a singer soon!

313
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,266
What?!

314
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,900
Congrats!
Do your best!

315
00:18:45,066 --> 00:18:46,600
We'll be rooting for you!

316
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,366
Thanks!

317
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,066
Oh! Because of you,
I got into trouble.

318
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,100
Hey! They told me that
I look like a 16-year-old!

319
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,666
Oh really?
I'm happy for you!

320
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,266
Hey, Takuto.

321
00:19:12,766 --> 00:19:15,233
They told me that I look
like a 16-year-old!

322
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,700
Of course you do.

323
00:19:16,866 --> 00:19:19,666
That's the way I cast the spell
on you so that you would.

324
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,633
I see. I get it now.

325
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:30,433
Where were you?!
I was just thinking of calling you!

326
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:33,833
Oh! The 16-year-old hill!

327
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:35,000
What's that?

328
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:41,233
We call this hill the "16-year-old hill,"

329
00:19:41,366 --> 00:19:44,033
and it's thought that if
you come here on your 16th birthday,

330
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:47,366
you'll have a boyfriend that year!

331
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,000
That's what the local
high school girls were saying.

332
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:58,633
You're quite the funny girl!

333
00:19:58,666 --> 00:19:59,666
That was pretty funny!

334
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,433
Hey! Let's start!

335
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,533
Y-Yes!

336
00:20:02,566 --> 00:20:04,666
Now, let's do our best Mitsuki.

337
00:20:04,966 --> 00:20:06,000
We're depending on you!

338
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:06,800
All right!

339
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,200
<i>I don't have to act like
a 16-year-old!</i>

340
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,733
<i>I should just act like myself!</i>

341
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,900
Yeah! You're looking good!

342
00:20:22,966 --> 00:20:24,333
You're getting into it more!

343
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:26,200
Yes! Thank you very much!

344
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,666
Mitsuki looks beautiful.

345
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,166
Takuto! What are you ogling for?

346
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,833
What? You're the one who
said that she was beautiful!

347
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:50,433
Then, I realized that I didn't have
to force myself to act more mature.

348
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:52,566
You're right, I feel the same way

349
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,766
that I wouldn't want you
to stop being like yourself.

350
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,666
Ok!

351
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,933
<i>But I should learn a little more.</i>

352
00:21:03,466 --> 00:21:08,766
<i>Eichi would be disappointed
if I didn't know anything at all.</i>

353
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,366
<i>I wonder where Eichi is.</i>

354
00:21:19,233 --> 00:21:20,733
<i>I want to see him soon.</i>

355
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,233
Girls are so strange.

356
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:27,033
What?

357
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:30,766
Just when you think that
they're talking very innocently,

358
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,866
all of a sudden they look very mature...

359
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:35,700
R-Really?!

360
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:37,200
Oh, did I guess correctly?

361
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,466
What were you thinking of just now?
Mitsuki?

362
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,233
N-Nothing!

363
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,066
Oh! It's really nothing!

364
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,133
Whoa! What's with this girl?!
Where does she think she's taking me?

365
00:23:23,533 --> 00:23:27,466
Takuto! You idiot! Why did you talk
when you're in your transformed state?

366
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,700
People can see you!

367
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:33,900
I had no choice! She said she was uneasy
and "can't record" all alone...

368
00:23:33,933 --> 00:23:35,533
Well then, hurry up and escape!

369
00:23:35,566 --> 00:23:38,766
That's true.
But hold on...this girl...

370
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,100
Next time on Full Moon:
"A Long Day in the Studio"

371
00:23:43,366 --> 00:23:44,900
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
