1
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:09,033
Meet Mitsuki Koyama, 12 years old.
Her dream is to become a singer.

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,200
But, poor thing,
she only has one year to live.

3
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:14,200
We're a couple of Death Spirits

4
00:00:14,233 --> 00:00:16,500
and we were sent to make sure
her destiny doesn't change.

5
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:19,233
But somehow we ended up
turning her older and

6
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:21,166
helped her win an audition!

7
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:24,133
Do you think that counts as
changing her destiny?

8
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,866
So, I wonder what's
going to happen today...

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,000
Got that?

10
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:34,700
Yes.

11
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:13,300
That girl passed the audition
because of you, Takuto!

12
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,700
Wow, I was surprised too.

13
00:02:15,866 --> 00:02:17,533
I didn't think she'd pass.

14
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:19,933
Don't talk as if it's
someone else's problem!

15
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:23,333
Hey, stop yelling, Meroko.

16
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:27,000
You haven't forgotten
our goal, have you?

17
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:31,700
It's to not let her live beyond
her remaining one-year life span, right?

18
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:32,666
Exactly!

19
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,500
Then there's no relationship

20
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:37,200
between that and whether or not
she passes the audition.

21
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,733
Oh, that's right!

22
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,533
No, it's not!

23
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,100
It'll be easier if
she stays at home.

24
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:46,233
It'll be a pain if she becomes
a singer and goes out everywhere!

25
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,900
After all, we used our powers to turn
that human into a sixteen-year-old,

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,033
so a simple letter of apology won't do!

27
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,100
What's so funny?

28
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,966
Nothing, just thinking about how
you two get along so well.

29
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:03,766
- What?
- D-Does it look that way?

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,633
Well...that's because...

31
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,800
We are the Death Spirits
who can even quiet crying children!

32
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,200
Green Onion Ramen!

33
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,133
Huh?

34
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:17,266
Thank you very much.

35
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,266
Huh? Yeah...don't mention it.

36
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,300
By the way, that song
you sang at the audition...

37
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:25,100
What's the name of it?

38
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:29,100
That was a song my father,
who was a musician, wrote.

39
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:30,566
I see...

40
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,166
Is something the matter?

41
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,800
Well, I recall hearing it somewhere,
but maybe not...

42
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:39,366
Huh?

43
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,566
Hey little chest!

44
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,700
Don't get carried away just
because you passed an audition.

45
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:46,333
W-When I'm like this I look fine!

46
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,500
Really, looking like that?

47
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:50,333
Meroko!
Stop trying to start an argument!

48
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,700
Oh, but I can't go home like this,

49
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,300
so please turn me back
to my previous self.

50
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,233
Yeah, of course.

51
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:09,566
Oh.

52
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,866
Amazing, I'm back to
my previous self.

53
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:15,000
Your chest is back too.

54
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:16,233
P-Please don't look.

55
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:17,400
C'mon prude...

56
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:18,100
Hey...

57
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:19,133
Huh?

58
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,833
You want to become
a singer that much?

59
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,266
Yup...it's a promise.

60
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:25,200
A promise?

61
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:28,166
A promise to Eichi.

62
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,200
Eichi?
Just who is this Eichi guy?!

63
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:32,100
Your boyfriend?

64
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:33,100
Is he?!

65
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:35,200
H-He's not my boyfriend!

66
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:36,833
Not yet.

67
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:40,100
So he's the man of your dreams?

68
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:41,700
Yeah...

69
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:47,100
Until two years ago,
I was in an orphanage.

70
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:49,333
Until my grandmother
came to get me,

71
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:51,033
Eichi was there too.

72
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:53,233
He shared his true feelings with me,

73
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:56,333
but before I could give him a proper answer,
he moved to America

74
00:04:56,366 --> 00:04:58,966
because the family that adopted him
needed to move there.

75
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,533
<i>No! No!</i>

76
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:04,166
<i>Don't go, Eichi.</i>

77
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,500
<i>Don't cry, Mitsuki.</i>

78
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:07,933
<i>America isn't that far away.</i>

79
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:09,133
<i>But...</i>

80
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:12,266
<i>Hey, make me a promise.</i>

81
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:13,733
<i>That when we meet next,</i>

82
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:15,800
<i>we'll be closer to
our dreams than we are now.</i>

83
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,766
<i>Me an astronomer...</i>

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,500
<i>You a singer...</i>

85
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,100
<i>Mitsuki...</i>

86
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,433
<i>I like you.</i>

87
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,433
<i>Even when I'm away from you...</i>

88
00:05:44,466 --> 00:05:46,766
<i>when I look up at the sky,
I'll look for the moon.</i>

89
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:50,233
<i>That's why you need to shine brighter...</i>

90
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,166
<i>so I can find you right away.</i>

91
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:54,933
<i>Shine brighter and brighter...</i>

92
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:58,766
Nothing since then?

93
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,433
What do you mean
nothing since?

94
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,833
You haven't communicated since then?

95
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:05,533
There's email,
there's international phone calls.

96
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,233
Well, I don't know where he is.

97
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:09,233
Oh...

98
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:11,533
But if I become a singer
and become famous,

99
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:14,166
my name might even
be known in America.

100
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:17,333
And if that happens,
Eichi will probably...

101
00:06:17,366 --> 00:06:19,133
he'll probably notice me.

102
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,100
You're single minded.

103
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:23,633
Well perhaps I'm being
too optimistic?

104
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,833
What? What's with
the scary face, Takuto?

105
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:31,800
How scary!

106
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,733
What's up with you?

107
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:37,033
I thought you genuinely
wanted to become a singer.

108
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,433
But it's for a guy!

109
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,233
Huh?

110
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,633
It's not genuine!

111
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:44,466
You can't become a good singer
with such a fake motive.

112
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:46,933
You should stop singing right away!

113
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:48,966
Wh-Why are you saying such things?

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,333
That's right! It's alright that
she's doing it for a guy.

115
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:52,133
No, that's not!

116
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,333
What?

117
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:55,666
I'll do my best to sing.

118
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:57,133
Really! No matter how hard you try

119
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,400
the fakeness that permeates
your efforts will come spilling out!

120
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,566
That's cruel...

121
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:03,633
My desire to be a singer
is not fake!

122
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,500
That's right!
What's fake about it?!

123
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:08,366
What's genuine about
"doing it for a guy"?!

124
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:09,800
In the first place,

125
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,800
there's something wrong about
not contacting you for two years!

126
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,966
You've been dumped, Mitsuki.

127
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,800
He's probably got a girl over there
and he's having fun!

128
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:22,400
E-Eichi wouldn't do such a thing!

129
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:24,166
How do you know that?

130
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:26,233
Because it's Eichi, that's why!

131
00:07:26,566 --> 00:07:28,166
What? That's ridiculous!

132
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,666
Hey, that's enough, Takuto!

133
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,666
In any case, I'll never help
someone like you again.

134
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,133
Someone who takes
singing so lightly!

135
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,200
H-Hold on Takuto!

136
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:39,200
Takuto!

137
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:40,733
I said Takuto!

138
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:44,333
Really, what's he angry about?!

139
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:49,000
What kind of person obstructs fate?

140
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:52,866
"A person whose fate is obstructed..."

141
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,800
"...usually involves a person who is loved."

142
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,100
This Eichi guy, we really need
to keep an eye on him.

143
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:16,533
What in the world
are you doing?

144
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:22,100
I didn't say no to
the audition to be mean.

145
00:08:22,433 --> 00:08:23,533
I stopped you because...

146
00:08:23,566 --> 00:08:25,800
I determined it would be impossible
in your present condition, Mitsuki.

147
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,433
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,366
But now you understand?

149
00:08:30,766 --> 00:08:31,233
Huh?

150
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,633
That you won't be able
to sing for awhile.

151
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,933
Oh, no, I passed!

152
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:37,833
Passed?

153
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,333
<i>What should I do?</i>

154
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:42,600
<i>Should I tell the doctor
what really happened?</i>

155
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:45,900
<i>But will he believe the part
about the transformation?</i>

156
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,933
<i>Also the part about the Death Spirits?</i>

157
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,166
What do you mean by pass?!

158
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,866
Did you pass the audition by chance?

159
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,566
W-Well...

160
00:08:57,433 --> 00:09:00,333
<i>Don't say it!
He won't believe you one bit!</i>

161
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:02,066
Umm... It's modeling.

162
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:04,100
Oh, modeling.

163
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:06,466
Well, I guess modeling is alright.

164
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,333
But definitely don't over do it.

165
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,300
Y-Yes.

166
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,900
By the way, what did you do
about the resumé?

167
00:09:11,966 --> 00:09:15,133
Did you put your grandmother's name
in the guardian column?

168
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:17,633
W-Well...actually...

169
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,166
Did you perhaps use my name?

170
00:09:20,566 --> 00:09:21,866
I-I'm sorry!

171
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,666
It's okay.

172
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:26,766
Let's keep it a secret from
your grandmother too.

173
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:28,933
A-Are you sure?

174
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:32,666
Yeah, I understand your feelings, Mitsuki.

175
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:35,166
It's for Eichi's sake, right?

176
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,833
Yes.

177
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:49,333
You shouldn't leave the house
without telling me!

178
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,933
On top of that,

179
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,366
having the doctor take you to
the amusement park!

180
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:55,433
There's a limit to shamelessness!

181
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:56,966
<i>The amusement park?</i>

182
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:01,166
<i>So that's how you explained it.
Thank you, Doctor!</i>

183
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,866
Do you understand?

184
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:04,966
I'm sorry!

185
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:08,200
If you do it again,
there'll be no excuses!

186
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:09,066
Yes...

187
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:11,700
That's all.

188
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,366
You're excused.

189
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:14,200
Yes.

190
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:17,866
Huh?

191
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,900
Wait a minute.
What is that?!

192
00:10:24,633 --> 00:10:25,633
What is it?!

193
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,433
Th-This...

194
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:28,666
Well...well...

195
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:30,433
I got it in a game.

196
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:34,466
I see.

197
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:38,833
E-Excuse me...

198
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:44,200
What a pesky old hag.

199
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:46,333
I thought, "yikes, she might
tell you to go throw me away."

200
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:50,300
But now you're one step
closer to your dream.

201
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:50,933
Yup.

202
00:10:50,966 --> 00:10:53,000
By the way, what's Eichi like?

203
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:54,366
If you have a photo, show me.

204
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,366
Come on, come on.

205
00:10:55,566 --> 00:10:56,300
Well...

206
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:57,666
Y-Yeah...

207
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:00,833
Wow!

208
00:11:00,866 --> 00:11:03,466
He's pretty handsome,
how old is he?

209
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,300
He's six years older than me,
so he's eighteen now.

210
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:11,200
So this picture is
when Eichi was sixteen...

211
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:13,300
How cute.

212
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,733
<i>There's something wrong about
not contacting you for two years!</i>

213
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,733
<i>You've been dumped,
Mitsuki.</i>

214
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:28,266
Eichi wouldn't...

215
00:11:29,366 --> 00:11:31,666
Eichi wouldn't do such a thing.

216
00:11:58,466 --> 00:12:00,066
So this is where you've been.

217
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:01,500
Leave me alone.

218
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:04,833
Then there's nowhere for me to go.

219
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:05,633
What?

220
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:08,500
It seems she wants to be alone too...

221
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,933
It was difficult for me to stay there...

222
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:13,166
Eichi...

223
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:15,933
It's your fault, Takuto!

224
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:17,466
What?!

225
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,766
She's depressed because you said
"you've been dumped"!

226
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:24,033
Well it's natural to think that!
Am I wrong?!

227
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:25,700
In the first place,

228
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:30,366
it's weird to keep thinking about
a guy who's dumped you!

229
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,800
- It is weird.
- Right?

230
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:35,500
There's no way
the Takuto from the past

231
00:12:35,566 --> 00:12:38,066
would have used
his powers carelessly.

232
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,566
Huh?

233
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:40,366
Have you fallen for her?

234
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,166
Idiot! That would never happen!

235
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:45,733
I-I did it as my duty!

236
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,800
Besides, I said "you've been dumped"
because, in general...

237
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:51,900
- long distance relationships don't work out.
<i>- There is something weird going on.</i>

238
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,100
- You know, they gradually...
<i>- Takuto is mine!</i>

239
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,766
Alright, go ahead.

240
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:03,933
Fortune telling?

241
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:06,366
Yup, I'll read your fortune
for the day.

242
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,633
Now, pick one card.

243
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,500
Okay!

244
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,866
Well...

245
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:17,466
Let's see.

246
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:20,766
That's great!
Today's your lucky day!

247
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:22,533
That's lucky?!

248
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:24,133
It's way lucky!

249
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,266
And your lucky word is...
"shopping."

250
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,066
Something good is bound to happen.

251
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,966
Alright, let's go out!

252
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,666
Yup!

253
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,166
Grandma's out today too...

254
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:36,200
Oh, but I need to ask Ms. Tanaka...

255
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,700
M-Mitsuki, did you need something?

256
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,133
I'd like to go shopping but...

257
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,300
Oh, you need your grandmother's...

258
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,333
I wonder what she'd say if
she found out

259
00:13:58,366 --> 00:14:01,633
you listen to music behind her back.

260
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:02,500
Huh?!

261
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,366
She might get mad at you.

262
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:08,066
Let's go.

263
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,233
Where's she going?

264
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,866
I guess I should leave it to
Meroko since she's with her.

265
00:14:37,366 --> 00:14:43,033
It's almost that time, Mitsuki,
so can you wait at the usual place?

266
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:44,800
Yes, I understand.

267
00:14:45,466 --> 00:14:48,633
So...so, please wait for just a minute.

268
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:51,500
Hey, hey!

269
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,200
There's somewhere I'd like to go too.

270
00:14:57,633 --> 00:15:00,466
Oh, I'll be awhile,
so can you wait outside?

271
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,200
Alright.

272
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,566
Death Spirits go to
the bathroom too.

273
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:11,033
She's gone.

274
00:15:14,366 --> 00:15:18,033
There's a reason I had to
have her come out...

275
00:15:22,366 --> 00:15:24,433
Now! Mero-Mero Change!

276
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,333
It's mine!

277
00:15:45,766 --> 00:15:46,300
Oh!

278
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:54,100
I wonder what that
"something good" will be...

279
00:15:57,633 --> 00:15:58,300
Oh...

280
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,433
Is that?

281
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:12,100
It's been a while, Mitsuki.

282
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:12,800
Huh?

283
00:16:13,966 --> 00:16:14,933
Eichi?

284
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,333
Yup.

285
00:16:17,033 --> 00:16:17,966
That's...

286
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:19,433
I-It can't be...

287
00:16:19,466 --> 00:16:20,600
Of course it can.

288
00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:23,166
<i>Actually, it's not.</i>

289
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,466
<i>If your wish to see Eichi is fulfilled...</i>

290
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,400
<i>you won't need to become a singer.</i>

291
00:16:27,466 --> 00:16:28,133
<i>And also...</i>

292
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:31,300
<i>Takuto will give up on you because
your true desire has appeared.</i>

293
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,533
<i>That's why...</i>

294
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,766
I-I'm having a dream, aren't I?

295
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:37,566
It's not a dream.

296
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,833
While I was in America...

297
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:44,766
not a day went by that
I didn't think of you.

298
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,766
That's why when I heard
you'd become a singer,

299
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,566
I rushed back here to Japan.

300
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,833
Huh? Who'd you hear that from?

301
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,400
Wh-Who...

302
00:16:54,433 --> 00:16:57,766
I-I know someone at
the record company, so...

303
00:16:58,133 --> 00:16:59,166
What a total coincidence!

304
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,833
Not a coincidence so much as...

305
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,133
...fate.

306
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,733
Fate.

307
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,233
By the way, did your voice
sound like that before?

308
00:17:08,566 --> 00:17:11,733
M-My voice may have changed
from living in America.

309
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:13,566
You know,
America is such a huge place.

310
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:17,666
Eichi, you're funny.

311
00:17:18,066 --> 00:17:18,666
Th-Think so?

312
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,800
Oh!

313
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,366
W-What next?

314
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,500
I need to apologize to you for something.

315
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:29,433
I had doubts about you, Eichi.

316
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:33,366
Well...I thought you had
forgotten about me.

317
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:34,633
What?

318
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,366
- Is that all?
- I'm sorry!

319
00:17:39,566 --> 00:17:40,600
Mitsuki...

320
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:43,466
Can you still like me as I am?

321
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,666
O-Of course.

322
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:47,233
That's great...

323
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,600
I wasn't able to answer you
properly back then.

324
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,066
But now...

325
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,166
I can also say that.

326
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,966
W-Wha—?

327
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:02,900
I lik—

328
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,466
I-I'm sorry!

329
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,500
Huh? Eichi.

330
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:09,733
Where are you going?

331
00:18:11,766 --> 00:18:12,900
Mr. Death Spirit...

332
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,500
That's not Eichi, it's Meroko.

333
00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:17,633
What? No way.

334
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,100
It's true.

335
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:22,500
Death Spirits are able to transform.

336
00:18:23,266 --> 00:18:25,066
Is that...so?

337
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:28,566
That's right.

338
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:29,233
Huh?

339
00:18:29,633 --> 00:18:32,366
There's no way Eichi would be here.

340
00:18:32,566 --> 00:18:34,400
Thanks for waiting.

341
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:36,933
What's the matter, Mitsuki?

342
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,300
It's nothing.

343
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:41,366
You look pale.

344
00:18:41,733 --> 00:18:43,066
Alright, let's go...

345
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:55,366
That was cruel!
How could you do such a thing?

346
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,500
I thought it was a good idea.

347
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:00,233
How could it be a good idea?

348
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:02,233
You toyed with something
that a person was serious about,

349
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,833
you toyed with
a person's genuine feelings!

350
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:07,166
I'm sorry!

351
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,766
An apology isn't enough!

352
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:09,500
What?

353
00:19:09,633 --> 00:19:10,166
Huh?

354
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,866
You said "genuine."
Didn't you say "fake" before?

355
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:15,233
Huh? Did I say that?

356
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:16,400
You did!

357
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:19,100
You said, "What's genuine about
doing it for a guy."

358
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:20,366
Th-That was...

359
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,366
in reference to the motive
for becoming a singer.

360
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,833
This and that are two separate things.

361
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,833
Are they?

362
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,800
What I did was terrible.

363
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,433
But what about you who used the words
"you've been dumped"

364
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:34,033
without even knowing about Eichi.
What about that, huh?

365
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:38,700
Can you say you haven't
hurt her feelings?

366
00:19:50,366 --> 00:19:51,433
Look...

367
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,400
"You've been dumped"
was merely my opinion...

368
00:19:54,633 --> 00:19:55,633
Or rather...

369
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:57,333
just one possibility...

370
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,200
No... it's...

371
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,433
Sorry.

372
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,833
No, I'm to blame too.

373
00:20:02,866 --> 00:20:03,566
What?

374
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,900
If I really believed in Eichi,

375
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:09,866
nothing anyone says should
bother me.

376
00:20:10,466 --> 00:20:12,066
That's why I won't waver anymore!

377
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:15,233
I like Eichi!

378
00:20:16,233 --> 00:20:18,700
But I like singing almost as much...

379
00:20:19,466 --> 00:20:21,966
If I like both,
I need to believe in both,

380
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,600
in Eichi and in singing!

381
00:20:23,766 --> 00:20:26,333
If not, my dreams won't come true!

382
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:29,333
There's no way
these feelings are fake!

383
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:33,233
I guess there's no way around it.

384
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,700
Go as far as you can with it.

385
00:20:35,966 --> 00:20:38,500
I'll help you with
your dream for one year.

386
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:39,900
Are you sure?!

387
00:20:40,266 --> 00:20:40,933
Oh!

388
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:44,300
My blood is effective as long as
I don't extinguish it.

389
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,266
I'll transform you anytime.

390
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,600
When I'm not near,

391
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:51,966
blow on this whistle and call me.

392
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,033
I'll rush over...

393
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:56,100
Thank you, Mr. Death Spirit!

394
00:20:56,566 --> 00:20:59,233
Stop calling me "Mr. Death Spirit."
Call me "Takuto"!

395
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:01,533
OK, thank you, Takuto.

396
00:21:01,633 --> 00:21:02,400
Don't mention it...

397
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:05,533
Could what I did
have had an opposite effect?

398
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:08,833
Oh, it's Miss Rabbit!

399
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,366
I wanted to thank you, Miss Rabbit.

400
00:21:12,466 --> 00:21:13,533
Thank me?

401
00:21:13,566 --> 00:21:14,166
Yup.

402
00:21:14,433 --> 00:21:17,333
Because it really was
my lucky day.

403
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:21,933
Transforming yourself into Eichi
was to give me courage, right?

404
00:21:22,766 --> 00:21:24,500
I'm really sorry!

405
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,566
Huh?

406
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,300
Why is Miss Rabbit apologizing?

407
00:21:28,633 --> 00:21:29,466
Who knows?

408
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,900
I'm sorry!

409
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,766
I'm sorry!

410
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,600
I won't ever do it again.

411
00:21:34,566 --> 00:21:35,333
<i>Eichi...</i>

412
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,700
<i>I passed the audition.</i>

413
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,733
<i>I will definitely come to see you, Eichi.</i>

414
00:23:15,066 --> 00:23:16,900
Oh no! Oh no! Takuto!

415
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:19,466
I heard a manager is coming
to visit Mitsuki!

416
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,733
Impossible! That means—

417
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:21,666
That's right.

418
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,166
But, remember how Dr. Wakaoji is
supposed to be Mitsuki's guardian?

419
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,166
Wait a minute.

420
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:29,000
He only knows Mitsuki as
a 12-year-old,

421
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:32,233
and the manager is gonna be expecting
to meet 16-year-old Mitsuki.

422
00:23:32,266 --> 00:23:33,733
What are we gonna do, Takuto?

423
00:23:33,766 --> 00:23:35,566
Darn it!
It's all so complicated.

424
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,200
How are we gonna to keep
everybody fooled?

425
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:40,433
Next time on Full Moon:
"Along Came the Manager"

426
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,966
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
