1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,533
Oh no! Mitsuki's pendant
has been stolen!

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,600
Gosh, I know you're excited about
seeing Eichi, but you can't be so careless!

3
00:00:14,066 --> 00:00:18,100
Thanks to the stupidity of the thieves,
we ended up getting back the pendant.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Takuto... The thing you said to Mitsuki...
Did you really mean it?

5
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,933
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,633
Got that?

7
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:34,733
Yes.

8
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:12,400
Takuto!

9
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,733
A-All right.
I'll give it back, so forgive me!

10
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,333
Here you go!

11
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:22,966
Damn it!

12
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:28,600
Takuto!

13
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,633
What an idiot.

14
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,166
What do I do?

15
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:43,666
Takuto is... Takuto is...

16
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,900
What're you crying for,
you little loser?

17
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,400
You're so stupid, Takuto!

18
00:02:58,766 --> 00:02:59,966
Takuto?

19
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:02,200
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

20
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,833
What's that for?!
Aren't you happy?!

21
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:09,233
I am happy! But why did you
do such a reckless thing?!

22
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:10,900
Takuto?

23
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,433
Why? Why do you always act so tough?
You did such a dangerous thing!

24
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,366
Oh, enough, enough!

25
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,400
Answer me, Takuto!

26
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,100
Why should I, you little loser?

27
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:23,233
What did you say?!

28
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,666
Takuto!

29
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:32,433
I-It's... It's because I like you,
of course!

30
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,500
Takuto...

31
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,566
I like you too!
I like you a lot Takuto!

32
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,166
Mitsuki?

33
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,566
Because you're such
a precious friend of mine!

34
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,766
Huh?

35
00:04:11,366 --> 00:04:15,066
That's why it's only natural that I worry when
you do something as reckless as that!

36
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:17,033
Don't ever do it again!

37
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:18,966
Th-That's not it!

38
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,666
What?

39
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:28,633
Takuto?

40
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,533
That's right!
We're your friends!

41
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:32,300
Yup!

42
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,100
Miss?

43
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:36,766
Are you all right?

44
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,833
Yes! Oh, and we found
the pendant we were looking for!

45
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,300
That's good.

46
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:49,733
By the way, I don't see your friend,
but where did he go?

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,066
Takuto said he was hungry,
and he went ahead.

48
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,733
Mitsuki!

49
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,366
Ms. Oshige, Dr. Wakaoji!

50
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:04,200
Mitsuki, are you all right?!

51
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,933
Are you okay?
You didn't get hurt, did you?

52
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,566
No, I'm all right.

53
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:11,600
We were really worried!

54
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,433
Don't do anything like this
ever again, okay?

55
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:18,233
I'll need more than one heart if I'm
gonna be this close to a heart attack!

56
00:05:18,366 --> 00:05:23,033
I'm sorry, but I really wanted
to get this pendant back.

57
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,833
I know. It's from Eichi, isn't it?

58
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,633
But please don't ever do
anything like this again.

59
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:30,733
Got that?

60
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:31,433
Yes!

61
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:33,866
Takuto...

62
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:42,700
We had originally planned to stop by
yesterday, but it should be all right.

63
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,133
How close are we?

64
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
We're almost there.

65
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,266
Isn't it pretty?

66
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:25,833
The temperature is a lot different from
Eagle Valley, so you need to be careful.

67
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:26,966
I will!

68
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:29,500
<i>We're finally here.</i>

69
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:48,800
<i>Eichi, I'm so close</i>
<i>to you right now.</i>

70
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:57,600
<i>So Takuto really</i>
<i>does like Mitsuki.</i>

71
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:17,933
According to my notes, the person
who found a family for Eichi lives here.

72
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,466
I wonder if they're out.

73
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,733
No one seems to be here.

74
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,166
What?! We're only one day late.
Why?

75
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:39,433
No way...

76
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:43,533
It's all right. Why don't we
just find Eichi on our own?

77
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:46,833
Yeah! We've come
this close to finding Eichi.

78
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,233
Keep your head up!

79
00:07:49,566 --> 00:07:50,233
Yes!

80
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:04,600
Hey, shouldn't we look
for him with them?

81
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:06,233
I'm tired!

82
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,066
Then why don't we go to that lake
we saw earlier? It was really pretty!

83
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,766
I don't wanna go.

84
00:08:12,466 --> 00:08:14,666
Oh, then let's have
lunch or something.

85
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,366
I don't wanna eat.

86
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:16,633
Then...

87
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,166
Just leave me alone!

88
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:29,100
<i>So Takuto laughed and played it off earlier,</i>
<i>but were those Takuto's true feelings?</i>

89
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:34,266
<i>It's because I like you,</i>
<i>of course!</i>

90
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,000
<i>No way! There's no way!</i>
<i>That can't be the case!</i>

91
00:08:39,266 --> 00:08:41,033
<i>Because if it is,</i>
<i>that would mean...</i>

92
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:46,100
<i>Unrequited love for sure?!</i>

93
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,866
<i>N-No!</i>
<i>I can't think negatively!</i>

94
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:52,666
<i>Even if his confession</i>
<i>were true,</i>

95
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,866
<i>Takuto may have totally</i>
<i>given up after being rejected!</i>

96
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,033
Meroko? What're you doing?

97
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,066
I've been watching you for a while,
but are you practicing your funny faces?

98
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,933
You really look like you're
having fun. I'm envious.

99
00:09:05,966 --> 00:09:07,500
Wh-Whose fault do you think...

100
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:08,266
Huh?

101
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:13,133
You should talk. You know, nothing gets
done when you mope around.

102
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,533
Just because you got rejected.

103
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:23,166
H-Hey, Takuto, calm down.
I didn't see anything.

104
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,433
And I didn't hear anything either.

105
00:09:24,466 --> 00:09:29,633
Yeah! You're totally right.
There's no use in thinking about it like this.

106
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:32,966
<i>Instead of thinking</i>
<i>about what'll happen</i>

107
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,033
<i>when she sees Eichi</i>
<i>and getting depressed,</i>

108
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:39,866
<i>I should watch them seeing each other</i>
<i>to break my attachment.</i>

109
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:42,566
You sometimes have good advice.

110
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,933
<i>No way! Did he understand</i>
<i>a little bit of my feelings?</i>

111
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:50,100
Takuto...

112
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:51,633
So, I'm gonna go!

113
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:52,600
Huh?

114
00:09:55,566 --> 00:10:00,033
Takuto? Gosh!
He has no idea how I feel!

115
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:03,100
Hey, come on!
Wait, Takuto!

116
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,733
I said, wait!

117
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,033
This beats me.

118
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:15,366
I thought we'd find him easily
after coming all the way here.

119
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:20,000
But it's strange.
I wonder why we can't we find him?

120
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:22,966
Maybe it's not this town?

121
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:25,766
Ms. Oshige!

122
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:30,200
S-Sorry, Mitsuki,
I didn't mean to bring you down.

123
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,233
Yeah, I know.

124
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:36,500
One cappuccino and...
so what are you having?

125
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,866
Let me see...

126
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:41,633
E-Excuse me!

127
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,833
Excuse me, are you Japanese?

128
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,700
Huh? Yes, we are.

129
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:48,866
I-If so...

130
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:51,500
The boy in this photograph...

131
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:57,200
Oh, I'm sure he's bigger now,
but his name is Eichi Sakurai.

132
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:58,666
Do you know him?

133
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:03,133
I want to see him!
I've come from Japan to see Eichi!

134
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:08,000
Oh, no. We don't know.

135
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,500
I wonder what's with that girl.

136
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:18,866
Just because we're Japanese?
To be asked out of the blue like that...

137
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,833
Oh, there they are!

138
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,566
Huh?

139
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,466
Mitsuki!

140
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,500
Mitsuki!

141
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:37,700
Mitsuki! Mitsuki!

142
00:12:00,966 --> 00:12:03,033
How is she, Dr. Wakaoji?

143
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,966
Well, it seems her fever
has gone down.

144
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:08,866
If she rests tonight,
there shouldn't be any problems.

145
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,800
We've suddenly come to a cold place,
and on top of that,

146
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,433
we searched around for Eichi, so her fatigue
has probably caught up with her.

147
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:17,033
So it's not that her throat
has gotten worse?

148
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:18,166
That's not the case.

149
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,300
Oh, thank goodness!

150
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,633
It's not good to worry so much.

151
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:24,133
Okay.

152
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,800
And you won't get better
on an empty stomach.

153
00:12:28,266 --> 00:12:30,166
I'll go pick up something to eat.

154
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:34,800
Stay in bed now!

155
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,766
Yes.

156
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,733
Eichi, where are you?

157
00:12:58,566 --> 00:12:59,966
I want to see you
as soon as possible.

158
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:05,633
<i>Mitsuki, I've wanted</i>
<i>to see you too.</i>

159
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
<i>Eichi...</i>

160
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:12,933
<i>I like you.</i>

161
00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:15,466
<i>It's because...</i>

162
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,466
<i>It's because I like you,</i>
<i>of course!</i>

163
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,500
<i>Why did you appear</i>
<i>in my thoughts, Takuto?</i>

164
00:13:27,066 --> 00:13:27,733
<i>Jeez!</i>

165
00:13:27,966 --> 00:13:30,600
<i>It's because you said that</i>
<i>so unexpectedly.</i>

166
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:35,433
<i>I like you too!</i>
<i>I like you a lot, Takuto!</i>

167
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,600
<i>I told him I liked him too.</i>

168
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:45,700
<i>Could it be that I can't find Eichi</i>
<i>because I said that to Takuto?</i>

169
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,333
<i>But, you're the only one I like, Eichi.</i>

170
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:58,933
<i>I can't see the stars or the moon.</i>

171
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,000
<i>It's only a little while before</i>
<i>I go back to Japan.</i>

172
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,833
<i>If I don't find Eichi...</i>

173
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:11,200
She's really an easy girl
to figure out, isn't she?

174
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:16,033
Her heart is filled with
thoughts of Eichi.

175
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:23,166
<i>So give it up, Takuto.</i>

176
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,000
She's...

177
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:33,800
Hey!

178
00:14:34,266 --> 00:14:35,600
You've gotta stay in bed!

179
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,466
But the sky looked
overcast from inside.

180
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,533
It's no different from out here!

181
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:45,500
But it made me feel like
I wouldn't see Eichi.

182
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,966
Just go back!

183
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I don't want to!

184
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:51,000
I won't go back until
I can see the stars!

185
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:52,433
Enough already!

186
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:58,066
<i>That's right! Keep arguing.</i>
<i>Get really upset at each other.</i>

187
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:01,733
<i>That way even Takuto</i>
<i>will give up completely.</i>

188
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:02,933
But...

189
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,800
Don't give me that!

190
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,900
What if you catch a cold
and get stuck in bed?!

191
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,333
You won't be able to
look for Eichi!

192
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,633
But if I can't see
the stars and the moon,

193
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,633
I feel like I won't be
able to find Eichi either.

194
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,666
Huh?

195
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,700
To not be able to see even
a single one today of all days...

196
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:26,466
It's almost as if I'm being told
Eichi's not here.

197
00:15:29,066 --> 00:15:30,066
No.

198
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:34,933
Maybe it's that Eichi
doesn't want to see me.

199
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:40,100
And that's why he's hiding
so he won't be found.

200
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:42,566
If so...

201
00:15:45,066 --> 00:15:46,333
What are you saying?!

202
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
Meroko...

203
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,500
It's not like you to get
so discouraged!

204
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:52,300
But...

205
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:58,866
You believed in Eichi so much!
I bet Eichi still thinks about you!

206
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:00,500
You think so?

207
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:01,533
Yes!

208
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:05,233
How could you stop
believing in him?

209
00:16:09,266 --> 00:16:09,933
Snow...

210
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,666
Huh?

211
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:24,066
It's as though the stars
are falling from the sky.

212
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,600
I do want to see Eichi!

213
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:37,533
That's the reason I came this far.
To tell him that I like him.

214
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,766
Mitsuki...

215
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:44,333
Takuto, Meroko, thank you.
I'll be all right.

216
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:48,433
I won't get depressed anymore
while we search for Eichi.

217
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,333
So your spirits are back up again.

218
00:16:57,733 --> 00:17:00,466
If you stay here, you'll catch a cold
so let's go back to your room.

219
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:01,433
Okay.

220
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:05,133
Sorry, Takuto,
for persisting like that.

221
00:17:05,466 --> 00:17:06,500
That's all right.

222
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:12,600
<i>Did I do it again?!</i>

223
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:18,066
<i>Even though, at first, I was thinking</i>
<i>it'd be great if they got in a fight.</i>

224
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,800
Hello?

225
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,200
Oh! Ms. Kazumi?!

226
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:48,100
What?!
Oh, yes! I understand!

227
00:17:50,766 --> 00:17:51,766
Ms. Oshige?

228
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:56,666
Mitsuki! Get ready right away!
We might be able to see Eichi today!

229
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,066
Oh, Ms. Oshige, calm down.

230
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:03,766
You should drive a little slower.

231
00:18:03,866 --> 00:18:05,800
Ms. Oshige! Faster!

232
00:18:05,866 --> 00:18:07,266
Leave it to me!

233
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:08,433
<i>Th-This is scary!</i>

234
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:17,100
Now!

235
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:18,300
Okay!

236
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,066
Now!

237
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,400
Japan Festival?

238
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,266
Apparently the local Japanese club
holds this event once a year for everyone.

239
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:32,666
And the person that Ms. Kazumi
told us about apparently volunteers here.

240
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:39,500
Huh?

241
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:41,700
Yes, that would be me.

242
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,400
I'm so glad!

243
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,866
Well, Kazumi Franklin told us
to come see you.

244
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,366
Oh... So it was you guys!

245
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:51,533
I had heard you were arriving
the day before yesterday,

246
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:53,466
but you didn't come so was
wondering what happened.

247
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:54,833
- Umm...
- Yes?

248
00:18:54,966 --> 00:18:58,600
The Sakurais...
Where do the Sakurais live?

249
00:18:58,966 --> 00:19:02,366
Oh, the Sakurais live over there.

250
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:08,533
See that small town on the other shore?
It's a short distance by car from that town.

251
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,233
I've never been there,

252
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:13,933
but I've heard it's a house
with a large fir tree,

253
00:19:13,966 --> 00:19:15,566
so I think you'll
recognize it right away.

254
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:22,633
<i>Eichi... He lives here and</i>
<i>sees this scenery everyday.</i>

255
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,100
So Mitsuki will finally
get to see Eichi!

256
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:34,533
Is that all right?

257
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:35,833
Is what all right?

258
00:19:38,033 --> 00:19:40,733
When all's said and done,
all we can do is watch, right?

259
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,200
That's true,
we are Death Spirits after all.

260
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,366
I don't know much else
but to look in the handbook like this.

261
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,333
Oh no, Takuto! Look at this!

262
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:56,233
IARUKAS IHCIE
What?!

263
00:19:57,033 --> 00:20:00,000
Eichi will make her death come sooner?!
What's that mean?!

264
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,900
I don't know!
But the handbook is absolute, you know!

265
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
We can't have her see Eichi!

266
00:20:07,466 --> 00:20:08,466
Takuto!

267
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:12,200
For now, I'll go ahead and investigate!
Meroko, don't leave Mitsuki's side!

268
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:13,233
Got it?!

269
00:20:13,366 --> 00:20:14,366
Yeah!

270
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,533
Gosh! Why's this happening
at a time like this?!

271
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:32,366
<i>A huge fir tree.</i>

272
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,266
<i>That must be it!</i>

273
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:38,333
<i>So this is where Eichi lives?</i>

274
00:20:42,633 --> 00:20:44,233
<i>This looks like Eichi's room.</i>

275
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,866
<i>What is this cold feeling?</i>

276
00:20:57,466 --> 00:21:01,433
<i>A shadow filled with the smell of death</i>
<i>surrounds this house.</i>

277
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:02,833
<i>Why?</i>

278
00:21:19,033 --> 00:21:22,233
<i>Is that the Sakurai husband and wife?</i>
<i>They look really old.</i>

279
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:30,366
You need to put it out of your mind.
That was an unfortunate accident.

280
00:21:30,533 --> 00:21:31,533
But...

281
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,000
<i>N-No way!</i>

282
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:25,200
Takuto! What's going on?!
Is Eichi really going to hasten her death?

283
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:30,100
I don't know! But his name appeared
backwards in the Death Spirit Handbook!

284
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,466
Is it okay...to let her see Eichi?!

285
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:39,100
She's been working so hard to
be able to see him! So... So...

286
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:44,166
Next time on Full Moon:
"Eternal Snow."

287
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:45,633
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
