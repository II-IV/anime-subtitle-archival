1
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:08,600
Tomorrow is the long-awaited
Christmas Eve!

2
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:10,200
In order to confess
my love to Takuto,

3
00:00:10,233 --> 00:00:13,766
I've worked hard night after night
to knit a scarf for him!

4
00:00:14,033 --> 00:00:15,966
But...but...but...

5
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:17,700
Why?!

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,533
I'm not done yet!

7
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:21,733
Mitsuki!

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,633
Please! Help me so I can
finish it in time!

9
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:27,866
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,600
Got that?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,666
Yes.

12
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,700
What am I going to do?

13
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,166
We forgot about your grandmother.

14
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,000
We were being careless.

15
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,700
We were on cloud nine after
the Best New Singer Award.

16
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,500
And it's not like I can butt in...

17
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:28,266
Well, you at least have a passport.
It could have been worse.

18
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:32,400
That's not the problem.
We have to persuade her grandmother.

19
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:33,766
That's right.

20
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:37,233
I know!

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,700
Meroko, you transform into Mitsuki
and stay at home.

22
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:43,400
What?!

23
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:46,500
So you mean I have to
stay home alone?

24
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,600
You've got it.

25
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:51,600
Takuto, do you really intend to go
and leave me?!

26
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:52,300
Huh?

27
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,166
- You're so mean!
- Ouch! Oww!

28
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:59,100
- That's outrageous! You've gone too far!
- Ouch, I get it!

29
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:02,366
What do you wanna do, Mitsuki?
Should we ask Meroko to do that?

30
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:03,466
No.

31
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:06,633
I want to go tell Grandma about
going to America.

32
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,233
I once lied to Grandma and went
to a sleepover.

33
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:18,800
That time, I felt like I had lied
to Grandma's feelings as well.

34
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:23,766
That's why this time
I want to tell her properly.

35
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:30,133
Yes.

36
00:03:30,966 --> 00:03:35,500
About that, I've gathered the information
so please come to the hospital.

37
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,900
So this is that new
treatment method?

38
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:49,166
Yes. If we continue the current treatment
and do the operation,

39
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,733
there's a possibility she
would lose her voice,

40
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:56,566
but with this treatment method
Dr. Lon Herberd wrote about,

41
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,433
there is no worry of that.

42
00:03:58,633 --> 00:03:59,300
And?

43
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,900
I contacted that doctor,
and we came to an agreement.

44
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,800
Then, Dr. Wakaoji...

45
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:06,700
Yes.

46
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:11,333
Yay! Then I'm sure
your grandmother will okay it!

47
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:12,800
What do you mean?

48
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:17,366
That Dr. What's-His-Name will
examine Mitsuki's throat!

49
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,066
What?

50
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:23,766
If we tell her that, your grandmother will
understand and let you go to America.

51
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,833
Really?

52
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,566
Yep.

53
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:29,633
I'll come to
your house tomorrow,

54
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,066
and we'll talk to your grandmother
about everything, okay?

55
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,266
Yes!

56
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:50,100
So, I contacted the doctor and he'd like to
examine the condition of Mitsuki's illness.

57
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:56,133
Then he'll determine whether this
treatment method can be used on Mitsuki.

58
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:57,100
So...

59
00:04:57,133 --> 00:05:01,000
You're saying you'd like to take
Mitsuki to America?

60
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,066
Yes.

61
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,866
It's quite sudden isn't it?

62
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:07,766
Grandma...

63
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,533
Doctors in Japan can't do
that medical treatment?

64
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:17,266
Unfortunately, no doctors in Japan
have attempted this treatment yet.

65
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,733
I thought that I'd study it on this trip
so that I can be of help in the future.

66
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:26,066
DEPARTURE FROM
CONVENTIONAL APPROACH
FOR THROAT DISEASE TREATMENT

67
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,500
I'm against it.

68
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:30,200
What?!

69
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:32,333
Why, Grandma?

70
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:36,833
I don't understand that medical
treatment very well yet.

71
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,266
No matter how many times
you explain that it's "good,"

72
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,933
I won't allow something I don't understand
for my beloved granddaughter.

73
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,333
However, if you actually
meet the doctor...

74
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:48,000
I understand what you're saying.

75
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:52,100
But to go to America
for only that reason.

76
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,166
Can't we wait until he has
the opportunity to come to Japan?

77
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
Well...

78
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,366
Mitsuki is a child with a weak body.

79
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,400
I can't agree to taking that child
around America.

80
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,766
My number one concern is
this child's body.

81
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:09,466
Is that wrong?

82
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,266
Mrs. Koyama, you're right
to be concerned, but...

83
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,433
Mitsuki, you shouldn't
just jump at new things

84
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:19,066
because you've heard
that they're good.

85
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,700
But Mrs. Koyama!

86
00:06:21,366 --> 00:06:25,100
What would you do if something
happened while she was in America?

87
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,800
Would you take responsibility?

88
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Grandma!

89
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:30,766
You be quiet.

90
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:34,333
No! Please!
Grandma, please understand.

91
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:38,166
With this medical treatment
I won't lose my voice!

92
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:43,000
I'll be able to keep doing what
I love to do... sing!

93
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,300
Mitsuki!

94
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,800
You...can't possibly still have
an interest in music, can you?!

95
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:54,966
Well?!

96
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,333
Mitsuki...

97
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,866
Mitsuki!

98
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:02,133
I'm a singer...

99
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,200
I mean, I want to be a singer!

100
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:06,433
Grandma!

101
00:07:06,466 --> 00:07:09,800
I want you to hear
my song, Grandma!

102
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,466
That's why I don't want
to lose my voice!

103
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:17,400
Dr. Wakaoji,
what is this all about?

104
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,100
It's just like Mitsuki said.

105
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:27,100
The two of you were
making a fool of me.

106
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,400
That's wrong!

107
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:31,100
That's enough! I don't want
to hear anything else!

108
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,700
Mrs. Koyama!

109
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:36,800
Grandma, please!
Please let me go to America!

110
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:38,833
I absolutely will not allow it.

111
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:44,600
Umm... Ma'am, Mitsuki is...

112
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:47,266
How dare you!
It's disgraceful to eavesdrop!

113
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,700
Y-Yes! I'm sorry!

114
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,000
Keep your spirits up.
I'll try asking her again tomorrow.

115
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,033
Okay...

116
00:08:12,766 --> 00:08:16,166
We'll make sure that you can go.
So don't worry.

117
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:17,400
Yes.

118
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:20,033
The operation...

119
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:21,200
Is it in there?

120
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:23,433
THINGS THAY MAY INTERRUPT FATE
THERE ARE NO NEW MESSAGES
No, it looks like it's okay.

121
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
I see.

122
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:28,600
What is it?

123
00:08:29,433 --> 00:08:31,900
We're in an unfortunate business.

124
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:33,833
Yeah.

125
00:08:43,466 --> 00:08:46,233
Grandma, please listen to me.

126
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,666
I'm coming in.

127
00:08:56,633 --> 00:08:59,766
I'm sorry that I've
kept quiet about music.

128
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,166
Of course,
I've known that you are against it.

129
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:08,200
But I really want to be a singer.

130
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:14,533
I believe that you are concerned
that my body is weak.

131
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:18,733
But please let me go to America.

132
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,200
I can't do that.

133
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:26,000
Why? Why, Grandma?

134
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,166
Is it because I didn't tell you
about my music?

135
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,533
Do you hate music that much?

136
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:36,866
Even though my mother and
I like music this much?

137
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,833
Why? Grandma, why don't you
understand my feelings at all?

138
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:48,133
I'm sure that my mother ran away from
home because you're like that, Grandma!

139
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:51,133
Grandma...

140
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,666
Grandma...

141
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,333
Grandma, I hate you!

142
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,666
Mitsuki!

143
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,200
<i>Mother, I hate you!</i>

144
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:18,166
What are you doing?

145
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,400
Packing to go to America.

146
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,366
What? But you still...

147
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,300
Hey, my life goes until spring
of next year, right?

148
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:32,533
Then...

149
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:37,566
I want to at least sing until then.

150
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:41,033
And I'm going to America,
no matter what.

151
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,333
Didn't Wakaoji say that he's going
to talk to her again?

152
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,666
It won't work! Grandma won't
go back on what she said.

153
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:51,300
On top of that,
this might be my last chance.

154
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,666
Hey, where are you going?

155
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:04,133
To Ms. Oshige's...

156
00:11:04,366 --> 00:11:08,200
Well, shouldn't you
at least tell Ms. Tanaka?

157
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:12,900
Ms. Koyama, here's your mail!

158
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Oh...thank you.

159
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,666
It's addressed to Grandma...

160
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,466
MRS. FUZUKI KOYAMA
HIMEKI MUSIC ACADEMY
A music school?!

161
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,166
- Huh?
- Huh?

162
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,333
I'd love to see you.
It's been so long.

163
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,766
Grandma graduated
from a music school?!

164
00:11:58,533 --> 00:11:59,700
I wonder if it's this way.

165
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:02,900
Hey, what's the point of doing this?

166
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:06,433
Grandma went to a music school!

167
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,800
The person who
sent this postcard

168
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,466
probably knows the reason
why she started hating music.

169
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,900
Have you been waiting?

170
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,966
I'm sorry, the lesson went
a little bit long.

171
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,100
I'm deeply touched that Fuzuki's
granddaughter would come all this way.

172
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:01,200
I'm sorry to trouble you.

173
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,200
Don't worry about it.

174
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:05,766
Oh, is tea okay with you?

175
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,466
Oh... Yes, thank you.

176
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,633
Wow, it smells good.

177
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,266
It's rose tea.

178
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:16,766
And here are some cookies.
I just baked them.

179
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:19,800
Please have some,
if you'd like.

180
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:20,533
Thank you.

181
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,766
It would have been nice if this kind of
person were her grandmother.

182
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,466
Shh...

183
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:47,433
Is something wrong?

184
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,366
Oh no...

185
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:58,233
So, Fuzuki really didn't
tell you anything, did she?

186
00:13:58,466 --> 00:13:59,133
No.

187
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:06,200
Fuzuki and I were childhood friends.

188
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:10,066
We really liked music.

189
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,633
Fuzuki would often play
the piano while I would sing.

190
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,666
And then we both
entered music school.

191
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:26,466
Fuzuki got engaged to someone
she met at the school.

192
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,766
And my, how she glowed so brightly.

193
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:31,666
Engaged?

194
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:32,500
Yes.

195
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But then...

196
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,733
<i>It's no good!</i>
<i>And the competition is so soon!</i>

197
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:44,833
<i>You'll exhaust yourself</i>
<i>if you practice too much like that.</i>

198
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,533
<i>You have to take</i>
<i>a little break.</i>

199
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:49,066
<i>I don't care about that.</i>

200
00:14:49,633 --> 00:14:54,666
<i>If I can't win this competition,</i>
<i>I'll never make it as a pianist in this world.</i>

201
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:55,633
<i>But—</i>

202
00:14:55,666 --> 00:15:01,000
<i>Shut up! It's different for you because</i>
<i>music is just a hobby!</i>

203
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,566
<i>Don't bother me.</i>

204
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:11,033
As a result,
their feelings drifted apart.

205
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,833
And he went abroad on his own.

206
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,466
He left my grandmother?

207
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,833
Yes... He chose
music over Fuzuki.

208
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:27,966
She debated whether or not
she should go with her fiancé,

209
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,766
but in the end, she made up her mind
to part from her fiancé and from music.

210
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:34,533
She said that it was painful
to be exposed to music.

211
00:15:35,866 --> 00:15:40,633
But Fuzuki said that
she made the right decision.

212
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:46,100
She said music is a demon that confuses
people's feeling and makes them unhappy.

213
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:47,233
No way!

214
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,300
And then, after a while,
she contacted me.

215
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,166
She said that she'd had
an arranged marriage.

216
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,400
And that she had been
blessed with a cute girl.

217
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,100
That must be my mother.

218
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,566
Back then, she would sometimes
come to this house to chat.

219
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:13,066
She would bring
her young Hazuki with her.

220
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:20,166
But since the young lady passed away,
she's been out of touch.

221
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:26,400
It's been a while since then, so I started
wondering how she's doing now,

222
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:28,966
and I took it upon myself to send
a postcard for the class reunion.

223
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,500
Oh, I see.

224
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,000
But to have a lovely
granddaughter like you...

225
00:16:34,566 --> 00:16:37,066
I'm sure that she's
very happy now.

226
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,300
I'm glad.

227
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:47,933
Today, I played very well,
and my teacher complimented me!

228
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,866
That's great!

229
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:50,766
Yeah!

230
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:55,166
<i>When I first met Grandma...</i>

231
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,233
<i>the cherry blossoms</i>
<i>were in full bloom.</i>

232
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:04,666
<i>When I saw Grandma's frowning face,</i>
<i>I thought I wasn't really welcome.</i>

233
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,600
<i>But back then,</i>
<i>Grandma was still suffering.</i>

234
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:21,133
What are you going to do?

235
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:22,866
What should I do?

236
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,166
Can you persuade
your grandmother?

237
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:27,833
I don't think I can.

238
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:33,200
So why are you
standing around here?

239
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,233
When I heard Grandma's story, I...

240
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,600
You're going home?

241
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,166
But if you return now,
she might lock you in.

242
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:44,433
Is that okay with you?

243
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:50,900
Was I a bad girl for
making Grandma sad?

244
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:52,600
Mitsuki...

245
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,033
I cause her a lot of worry to begin with,
what with my weak body.

246
00:17:57,566 --> 00:17:59,300
But then to say that I want to be
a singer on top of that...

247
00:18:01,133 --> 00:18:06,100
I'm sure that she hates even
hearing the word "music."

248
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,800
Ma'am!

249
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,700
What is it?

250
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:18,233
Umm... Mitsuki is...

251
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,966
Mitsuki isn't here!

252
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:25,166
When I came to call her for dinner,
she was gone.

253
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,066
Almost all her things
are gone,

254
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,933
and her beloved music box is
nowhere to be found.

255
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:34,000
Could it be...
that she's run away?

256
00:18:35,066 --> 00:18:39,000
<i>If you don't accept me,</i>
<i>Mother, then I'll move out!</i>

257
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,500
<i>Mother, I hate you!</i>

258
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:42,433
<i>Hazuki!</i>

259
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,466
<i>My beloved daughter, who means</i>
<i>more to me than anything.</i>

260
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,766
<i>And...</i>

261
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:54,166
<i>Thank you for taking me in.</i>
<i>My name is Mitsuki.</i>

262
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,833
<i>The child that was born in</i>
<i>exchange for that girl's life.</i>

263
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:02,500
<i>The child of the man</i>
<i>who stole Hazuki.</i>

264
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,100
<i>What should I say?</i>

265
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,633
<i>How should I speak to her?</i>

266
00:19:13,266 --> 00:19:16,600
<i>But this time,</i>
<i>I have to protect her.</i>

267
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,633
You're not a bad girl.

268
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:31,233
You never stopped wanting
your grandmother to like music.

269
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:32,300
Am I wrong?

270
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,033
That shows that you care
about your grandmother.

271
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:38,500
But...

272
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:42,100
Well, can you tell her everything
about the length of your life?

273
00:19:42,366 --> 00:19:43,033
What?

274
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:45,300
Takuto!
Why would you say that?!

275
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,200
If I tell her that,
Grandma will be sad.

276
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:53,466
But if you don't, your grandmother won't
understand your feelings at all.

277
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,133
That's true, but...

278
00:19:56,266 --> 00:20:00,266
I understand why your grandmother
came to hate music.

279
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:05,333
But you have a reason why
you have to sing, don't you?

280
00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:07,366
Takuto...

281
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,233
Why do you sing songs?

282
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:20,400
Tanaka! Contact every place
you can think of!

283
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:21,333
Yes!

284
00:20:24,633 --> 00:20:25,633
Mitsuki!

285
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:27,066
Grandma...

286
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,133
Mitsuki! What a relief.

287
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,366
What are you doing?
Hurry up and come in!

288
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:36,066
Grandma.

289
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:37,200
What is it?

290
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,566
I'm going to America.

291
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:47,000
Even if you don't approve,
I want to go to America.

292
00:20:49,066 --> 00:20:52,633
You're going to leave me too?

293
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,666
I'm sorry. I don't think
that you'll understand.

294
00:20:57,166 --> 00:21:01,333
But Grandma, I love you.

295
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,400
That wasn't true
when I said I hate you.

296
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,600
Please just understand that.

297
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,866
Please listen to my songs someday!

298
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:12,933
I'm sorry!

299
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,466
Mitsuki! Mitsuki—

300
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,333
Ma'am!

301
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,366
Ma'am, are you injured?!

302
00:21:21,633 --> 00:21:22,300
Ma'am...

303
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,566
It's always the same.

304
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:36,733
It's always the things I hold dear
that pull away from my hands.

305
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:21,133
We're here in America!

306
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,266
Hey Takuto,
where do you want to go?!

307
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,500
You're completely
in sightseeing mode.

308
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:27,466
Do you understand,
you and I didn't come to play.

309
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,700
You're so annoying!

310
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,300
If you wanna talk
about being excited,

311
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:34,133
I'm not all that different from
that girl in full-on love mode with Eichi!

312
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,966
Once again,
you're taking her side!

313
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,233
It's so frustrating!

314
00:23:38,266 --> 00:23:39,666
Stupid! Stop it, Meroko!

315
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,166
It's not like that!

316
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,700
Next time on Full Moon:
"Across the Pacific."

317
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:47,033
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
