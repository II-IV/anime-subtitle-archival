1
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:08,000
This is Mitsuki Koyama,
12 years old.

2
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:11,833
An incident in which we could not
enter the house occurred.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,366
It was due to a rock
that was cursed.

4
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:16,700
Our voice and letters
couldn't reach her.

5
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:22,133
As I was wondering what to do,
Takuto managed to break the curse.

6
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:25,166
For a moment,
I wasn't sure what to do.

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,233
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Got that?

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,066
Yes.

10
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:28,933
Okay, we've arrived.

11
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,366
This is Hiiragi-En where today's
mini-concert will be held.

12
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,833
Wow...it's a great place.

13
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,466
What's so great about it?

14
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,066
Just when I finally get a chance
to go out with Takuto...

15
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,433
I hate being in such
an uncivilized place!

16
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,200
She really wanted to come here,
no matter what.

17
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,500
Uh! That's right.

18
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,866
She was raised in an institution,
wasn't she?

19
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,333
My, oh my...

20
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:52,033
Welcome and thank you for
coming to such a distant place.

21
00:02:52,366 --> 00:02:53,533
It's a pleasure.

22
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:56,233
Thank you very much
for inviting us.

23
00:02:56,433 --> 00:02:58,466
My name is Ms. Date,
the Home Director.

24
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:02,300
Everyone, let's greet Full Moon.

25
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:03,766
One, two, three...

26
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:06,933
- Hello, Full Moon!
- Hello, Full Moon!

27
00:03:07,066 --> 00:03:10,133
Hello! My name is Full Moon.
It's nice to meet you all.

28
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,333
Eichi?

29
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:35,100
<i>Eichi?</i>

30
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:38,200
<i>Mitsuki.</i>

31
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
<i>Eichi...</i>

32
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:43,133
Mitsuki... Mitsuki!

33
00:03:44,966 --> 00:03:45,966
Mitsuki!

34
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,366
Ms. Oshige!

35
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Goodness!

36
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:51,700
What's the matter with you,
all in a daze like that?

37
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:53,733
It's because...

38
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,466
It's nothing.

39
00:03:58,566 --> 00:04:00,466
Please pull yourself together.

40
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,733
Hey, give me this.

41
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:03,800
I'm gonna have
Full Moon autograph it.

42
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:05,033
Uh, that's—!

43
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:06,633
That belongs to Sora!

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Taiki! Don't be so rough!

45
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:19,133
Your name is Taiki?

46
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,100
Taiki!

47
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:29,266
Don't scold Taiki!
Taiki hasn't done anything bad!

48
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:30,533
Sora.

49
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:33,033
Sora, let's go!

50
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:33,966
Okay!

51
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,066
I'm very sorry.

52
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:44,033
Please don't worry about it.
It's all right.

53
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,866
He must be a little overexcited
because Full Moon is visiting.

54
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:49,600
Yes, that's certainly true.

55
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,833
All of the children
are very thrilled.

56
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,300
Of course,
I am extremely thrilled too.

57
00:04:58,133 --> 00:05:01,366
When I received this picture,
I wanted to visit, no matter what.

58
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:03,533
I see...

59
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,633
The child who drew that was
Sora from earlier...

60
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:13,633
Sora is a big Full Moon fan.

61
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,133
She watches all the TV shows
and reads all the magazines.

62
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,233
Wow, that makes me very happy.

63
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:22,500
Umm...

64
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:26,500
Are Sora and Taiki
brother and sister?

65
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,800
No, they aren't siblings...

66
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,433
Sora was a very shy and withdrawn child
and didn't take to anyone.

67
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:40,033
But fortunately, she's become a lot
more outgoing ever since Taiki came.

68
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,900
And they've become like family.

69
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,100
I believe the connection between those two
is even deeper than just that of family.

70
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,233
<i>Mitsuki, haven't you
written it yet?</i>

71
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,800
<i>I wrote mine to Kuroda of
the Japan Soccer League.</i>

72
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,500
<i>I wrote mine to my mother.</i>

73
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:12,266
<i>I...</i>

74
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:16,300
<i>You ought to write to either
your father or mother too, Mitsuki.</i>

75
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,133
<i>But I don't have either one.</i>

76
00:06:19,366 --> 00:06:20,900
<i>Huh! Why?</i>

77
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,033
<i>- Why?
- Yeah.</i>

78
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:32,033
<i>This is father...
and this is mother...</i>

79
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:38,100
<i>Hey...I'm passing you the ball!</i>

80
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:52,900
<i>What's the matter?</i>

81
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,466
<i>Umm...</i>

82
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:19,933
<i>This is where I live.</i>

83
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,700
<i>Welcome home!</i>

84
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:26,200
<i>Huh?!</i>

85
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,433
<i>I'm living here too,
starting today.</i>

86
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:33,566
<i>I'm home.</i>

87
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,666
<i>Welcome home, Mitsuki.</i>

88
00:07:35,366 --> 00:07:36,366
<i>What a pretty name.</i>

89
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:38,833
<i>I'm home!</i>

90
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,766
<i>I'm home too!</i>

91
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:42,300
<i>Welcome home!</i>

92
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:43,566
<i>I'm home!</i>

93
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,700
I'm home.

94
00:07:49,066 --> 00:07:51,433
Is something the matter?

95
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,633
Umm...
Right now...right now...

96
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,500
R-Right now I'm testing
the microphone!

97
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:05,100
F-Full Moon is that delighted
about singing here!

98
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:05,833
Right?!

99
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:06,866
Y-Yes!

100
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:09,566
I see... That's wonderful...

101
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:11,266
Of course,
it's about Eichi again, right?

102
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,333
There's one again today...
a keyword...

103
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:17,000
Confetti, huh.

104
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:18,133
Confetti?

105
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,133
The stuff that was prepared
for the concert, right.

106
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:25,333
In any case, we'll be fine if
we collect every bit of paper there is.

107
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,766
Hey, Takuto,
you help with this too.

108
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,566
One of us has to stay with
her or else, right?!

109
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:36,033
Gimme a break!

110
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,066
Your bags which were delivered
earlier today are over here.

111
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,333
Taiki!

112
00:08:43,766 --> 00:08:45,500
What are you doing here?

113
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,400
Taiki... That was your name,
wasn't it?

114
00:08:49,366 --> 00:08:52,366
If you don't mind,
I'd like to talk to you?

115
00:08:57,533 --> 00:08:58,533
Mitsuki!

116
00:08:58,733 --> 00:08:59,733
Taiki!

117
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:01,400
Are you all right, Mitsuki?

118
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,666
I-I'm fine...
It doesn't hurt at all.

119
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:09,400
I apologize for his behavior.

120
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:11,766
Really, I'm fine.

121
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:14,700
Your costume's not here!

122
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,466
What?!

123
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:18,066
Could it be that that boy earlier on...

124
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:22,333
My goodness! I will tell him to
return it to you immediately.

125
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,500
There's a limit to mischief!

126
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,333
My apologies!

127
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,066
In any case, we must get it
back immediately!

128
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,333
Please wait!

129
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,166
Huh?

130
00:09:32,766 --> 00:09:33,766
Please wait!

131
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:37,533
We don't yet know if
it's because of Taiki's mischief.

132
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:38,900
How can you say that?

133
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,700
But it's almost time for
the concert to start.

134
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It'll be fine.

135
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:46,066
If worse comes to worst,
I can sing without my costume.

136
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:46,966
But...

137
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,933
I don't want to be suspicious
of that boy.

138
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:55,033
And even if he did take my costume,
there's probably a good reason for it.

139
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:56,966
Therefore...

140
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:02,033
All right, if you're that adamant.

141
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:04,266
Thank you, Ms.Oshige!

142
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,233
Kindergarten Director,
may I check the stage.

143
00:10:08,766 --> 00:10:09,800
Uh, certainly.

144
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:12,666
Mitsuki, I'm going ahead of you.

145
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,233
Owww...

146
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:20,666
Trying too hard.

147
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:21,500
But...

148
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:24,700
Are you protecting him because
he resembles Eichi?

149
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:26,400
It's not like that.

150
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,600
No, maybe it is, after all.

151
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:32,566
It's a strange feeling.

152
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,500
I'm now Full Moon at age sixteen...

153
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,833
But right here...

154
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:43,500
Eichi and I from those days
long past are still right here.

155
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:47,933
Where are you going?

156
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,666
I thought I'd look
for your costume.

157
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:53,766
What is it?

158
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:57,400
I was just thinking that you're
a really nice person after all, Takuto!

159
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,700
It's not like that at all.

160
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,000
This is the Death Spirit's job too!

161
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,666
Job? It's never that.

162
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,233
You're always at
Mitsuki's beck and call!

163
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,166
I hate you, Takuto!

164
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,233
Gimme a break!

165
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,733
I tried to build
the stage like this.

166
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,233
Wow... How cute!

167
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,333
Very nice.

168
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:23,866
Kindergarten Director...

169
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Hello.

170
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,666
Where did that boy go?

171
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,133
So it was his doing after all.
I'm getting it back.

172
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,966
What's going on?

173
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:26,700
Takuto hasn't come back yet.

174
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,966
All right, everyone.
Let's call her to the stage!

175
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:46,333
Welcome to Hiiragi Kindergarten!

176
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,433
- Full Moon!
- Full Moon!

177
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,800
Oh my goodness,
I wonder what happened?!

178
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,600
I'm sorry, Full Moon.

179
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,666
This boy turned off the power!

180
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:15,666
Taiki?!

181
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:19,100
I-I hate you!

182
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:20,933
Let go!

183
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,333
Hey!

184
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
Wait, Taiki!

185
00:13:29,966 --> 00:13:30,633
Taiki!

186
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,066
I'm terribly sorry after you went
to all the trouble of visiting.

187
00:13:43,466 --> 00:13:44,700
This is terrible.

188
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,300
As it is, the concert will
be cancelled.

189
00:13:47,366 --> 00:13:48,366
Please wait.

190
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,700
There must be a reason
behind this.

191
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:53,000
You're still saying that?

192
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:57,133
I mean, Taiki and Sora
are that close, right?

193
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,366
I can't believe that Taiki
would play mischief

194
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,566
and get in the way of a concert
that Sora was looking forward to so much.

195
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,100
But even if you say that,

196
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:09,800
the fact remains that it's that kid
who created a disturbance.

197
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,000
It must be that after all...

198
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,066
Huh?

199
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:18,233
To be honest, there has
been discussion about Sora's adoption.

200
00:14:18,866 --> 00:14:20,600
It is a very good situation for her.

201
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,733
But because Sora has been
looking forward to the concert so much,

202
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:30,000
it was decided that the adoption
would take place today after it's over.

203
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:31,800
That means that she and Taiki?

204
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,300
Will they be separated?

205
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:38,266
They say they simply can't
adopt both of them.

206
00:14:50,866 --> 00:14:53,166
That must be very difficult
for Taiki.

207
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,333
Kindergarten Director!

208
00:14:57,633 --> 00:14:59,800
Taiki and Sora are gone!

209
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,033
- Huh?!
- Huh?!

210
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,133
Sora!

211
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:08,500
Where are you, Sora?!

212
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,533
Taiki!

213
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,933
Hey!

214
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:13,933
Come back!

215
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,333
Sora...

216
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:16,833
Taiki...

217
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,866
Sora...

218
00:15:19,966 --> 00:15:22,033
Where did those two go?!

219
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:24,833
Meroko!

220
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,633
Please! Please search for the two
of them from the sky!

221
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,333
Hey, we're not your servants!

222
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,066
In the first place, we're very busy
with our job as Death Spirits!

223
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Still, please search!

224
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,766
I truly understand how
Taiki is feeling!

225
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:43,166
Even though he got
in the way of your concert?

226
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,366
You and your whimsies...

227
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,266
They have to go their separate
ways after the concert,

228
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,366
so he didn't want
the concert to end.

229
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,866
Taiki was desperate!

230
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,533
If you mean the two of them,
they're on top of the hill.

231
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:56,533
Takuto!

232
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,233
Got it!
On top of the hill, right!

233
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:02,000
Gimme a break.
Siding with her again!

234
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:04,666
Where are you going, Takuto?

235
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,166
Meroko, you come with me too!

236
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:09,700
Yes!

237
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,866
Mitsuki, where are you going?!

238
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,900
Come to think of it...

239
00:16:17,633 --> 00:16:19,933
If I remember correctly,
there's a tree at the top of the hill

240
00:16:19,966 --> 00:16:22,933
which they named
"Taiki and Sora's Tree"!

241
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:34,266
Hang on tight!
It's a short flight to the hill.

242
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:35,200
Okay!

243
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:38,533
I wouldn't mind holding
Takuto's hand forever!

244
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:42,800
Over there!

245
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,866
Taiki! Sora!

246
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,766
Don't come near!

247
00:16:53,266 --> 00:16:54,900
I'm not letting Sora go anywhere!

248
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,466
I'm not going anywhere either!

249
00:16:57,366 --> 00:16:59,100
I'm staying right here with Taiki!

250
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,300
Please believe this!

251
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:08,133
It's sad to part but there's
no such thing as forever.

252
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,100
The more strongly you believe
that you never want to part...

253
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:13,766
the more you will have
the chance to meet again!

254
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,033
How could you possibly
understand how we feel!

255
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:18,666
<i>Won't we ever meet again?!</i>

256
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,166
You will meet again.

257
00:17:25,866 --> 00:17:28,666
I sing because I believe
that we will meet again.

258
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,500
Believe...
That you will surely meet again...

259
00:17:34,766 --> 00:17:35,433
Therefore...

260
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:46,800
Even if you and Sora part,
you won't be alone, Taiki.

261
00:19:47,466 --> 00:19:50,300
You will always be together
under the same sky.

262
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,800
The deeper your feelings,
the closer you will feel to each other.

263
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,166
I'm sure of that!

264
00:19:57,033 --> 00:19:57,700
Taiki.

265
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,200
Will we really be able
to meet again?

266
00:20:03,466 --> 00:20:04,133
Yes!

267
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,833
Sora, no matter how far apart we are,
I will never forget you.

268
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
Neither will I.

269
00:20:18,566 --> 00:20:20,800
Kindergarten Director, we have
made up our minds.

270
00:20:21,366 --> 00:20:23,266
Please allow us to adopt
both children.

271
00:20:23,866 --> 00:20:28,266
We wouldn't possibly separate the two
of them when it would make them so sad.

272
00:20:32,366 --> 00:20:33,533
Hello, Taiki!

273
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,566
From now on, you'll really
be brother and sister.

274
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:37,433
- Okay!
- Okay!

275
00:20:37,466 --> 00:20:38,500
I'm so happy for them.

276
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,000
It's really wonderful.

277
00:20:47,133 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm returning...this...

278
00:20:49,566 --> 00:20:50,566
I'm sorry.

279
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:52,066
Thank you.

280
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:57,900
Congratulations!

281
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
Is this really okay?

282
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:09,733
Huh? What about?

283
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,966
The confetti?!

284
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:17,300
The Manager will be mad at us!

285
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,900
Come, Full Moon!

286
00:21:19,266 --> 00:21:20,833
Let's start the concert again.

287
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,933
Let's go back to Hiiragi Kindergarten!

288
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,200
All right!

289
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,033
<i>I truly believe that
I will see you again...Eichi!</i>

290
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,066
Takuto, hurry, hurry!

291
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,166
We're being summoned by
the Manager of the Death Spirits.

292
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,900
We'll catch hell for it if we're late!

293
00:23:24,933 --> 00:23:28,900
Wait a sec. Is that girl gonna
be okay if we're both away?

294
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,333
You're such a worrywart, Takuto.

295
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:35,233
As long as we transform her,
Oshige, her manager,

296
00:23:35,266 --> 00:23:36,600
will take care of whatever comes up.

297
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,100
But I heard her manager
has the day off today.

298
00:23:39,133 --> 00:23:39,800
Yikes...

299
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:44,733
Next time on Full Moon:
"Do Your Best, Deputy Manager!"

300
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,933
- Don't miss it!
- Don't miss it!
