1
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:09,200
Oh no! Oh no! An unexpected person
has come from the spirit world!

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,700
His name is Izumi Lio,
and he came because

3
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:15,366
the Division Chief of Death Spirits told him
to make sure we were doing our jobs.

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,066
What'll we do if they find out that we've
been transforming Mitsuki into Full Moon?!

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,833
We were able to
fool them this time,

6
00:00:21,866 --> 00:00:24,700
but I get a bad feeling
we'll be caught sometime soon!

7
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:28,000
So, I wonder what's going to
happen today...

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,733
Got that?

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:34,766
Yes.

10
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:13,000
<i>Well, our song of the day is</i>
<i>the one that rose</i>

11
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:15,300
<i>to the top of the charts for</i>
<i>the first time this week,</i>

12
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,600
<i>Full Moon's "Eternal Snow"!</i>

13
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:20,466
<i>This song is a cover song</i>
<i>of a masterpiece</i>

14
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,333
<i>created by an 80's band</i>
<i>called "Route L,"</i>

15
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:25,466
<i>and it is garnering quite</i>
<i>a lot of attention!</i>

16
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:28,166
<i>This song targets</i>
<i>a wide range of ages.</i>

17
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:30,266
<i>Let's see how well it does!</i>

18
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:31,766
<i>Check it out!</i>

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,833
"Hi Full Moon.
How are you doing?"

20
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:38,100
"I went to buy your new single
the day it came out,"

21
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:40,300
"but once I got home, I found out
that my mom had bought it too."

22
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:43,133
"My mom and I are both
cheering for you!" this one says!

23
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:44,866
Umm... This one says...

24
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:47,433
Wow, this is from Nanami!

25
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:51,366
<i>Full Moon, long time no see!</i>
<i>I bought "Eternal Snow."</i>

26
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:53,266
<i>This song is also fantastic!</i>

27
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,800
<i>There is no doubt about that because</i>
<i>I think so and I'm your number one fan!</i>

28
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,500
Thanks!

29
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:04,166
But I can barely read all these,
let alone reply to them.

30
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,366
Here! I'll help you with that!

31
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
Stupid!

32
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:10,266
You can't write them back!

33
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,866
There, there. Anyway, this looks like
a pretty good start.

34
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,400
Maybe this brought you closer
to finding Eichi.

35
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:17,200
What?!

36
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,433
Y-You think so?

37
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,833
Oh, yeah! Maybe he'll come back
from America all of a sudden!

38
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:24,600
What?! Oh my!

39
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:28,300
Yeah! And you two will embrace each other
for the miraculous reunion!

40
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:30,400
Mitsuki! Eichi!

41
00:03:31,466 --> 00:03:33,766
No, Meroko, stop it now!
Really!

42
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:52,833
<i>That was Full Moon's</i>
<i>"Eternal Snow."</i>

43
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,800
Excuse me, Ma'am.

44
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:10,533
You have a visitor.

45
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:12,066
Who is it?

46
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:13,633
Well...

47
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:18,166
Oh, Grandmother!

48
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:22,200
I have not seen you in so long.

49
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:25,533
Oh, please, don't be so formal!

50
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,066
I'm so glad to see you again!

51
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:29,733
Yes.

52
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:33,133
Excuse me, Miss.

53
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:35,400
Would you please take your shoes off?

54
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,100
What?! To see me?

55
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:41,233
Yes... She says she came all
the way from America.

56
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,633
From America?

57
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:43,966
Who could it be?

58
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:50,266
From America, eh? Maybe it's Eichi!

59
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,300
That's impossible!

60
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,433
It's a souvenir for you.

61
00:04:57,866 --> 00:04:59,700
Here, please don't be so reserved!

62
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,866
I think it suits you well, actually!

63
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,033
Excuse me.

64
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:06,833
Hi, Mitsuki!

65
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,366
Oh, it was you, Ms. Kazumi!

66
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,700
I was wondering who would
be visiting me from America.

67
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:16,666
I am now married and living in America.

68
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:18,400
Really?

69
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:22,100
Oh, it's been two years!
How have you been?

70
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:24,000
Hey, Mitsuki!

71
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:25,600
Who's she?

72
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,800
She's Ms. Kazumi, my teacher from
when I was in the orphanage.

73
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,600
How disappointing.

74
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:38,333
Ms. Kazumi, you're being dramatic.

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,533
But I sure am glad you came
all the way to see me.

76
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,066
I had to run some errands in Japan,
and when I was at the airport,

77
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,866
I heard a song that
brought back memories.

78
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,566
<i>A song?</i>

79
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:52,866
Yes. The one that your father wrote,
"Eternal Snow."

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,133
You remember it, right?

81
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:55,666
Umm... Yeah...

82
00:06:00,633 --> 00:06:03,900
Hey! If you don't mind, why don't you
show me your room, Mitsuki!

83
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,633
Is that all right?

84
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,433
Well, sure.

85
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,133
Okay. Then, let's go!

86
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,566
Huh? Oh, yes!

87
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:21,866
Yes, yes, this melody.
This is such a wonderful music box.

88
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:25,133
This is a memento from my parents.

89
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,900
Oh really?

90
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,200
Ms. Kazumi, I'm sorry.

91
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,100
My grandmother doesn't
really like music.

92
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,633
No problem. I kind of sensed
that something was up.

93
00:06:36,033 --> 00:06:39,000
But weren't you dreaming
of becoming a singer?

94
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,566
Yes! I haven't given up on that!

95
00:06:42,766 --> 00:06:44,266
Of course. Because...

96
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,666
- "No one can get in the way of my dream!"
- "No one can get in the way of my dream!"

97
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:51,733
You always said this to me back
when I was in the orphanage.

98
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:53,966
You remembered?

99
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:54,800
That's right!

100
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:57,233
No one can get in
the way of dreams!

101
00:06:57,733 --> 00:07:00,533
<i>I'll definitely make Takuto</i>
<i>care about me!</i>

102
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,633
Hey, what are you
thinking about right now?

103
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,266
Are you curious about
what I am thinking?

104
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,466
No.

105
00:07:08,566 --> 00:07:12,300
Oh, wasn't this calendar Eichi's?

106
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:16,300
Oh, yes. I'm looking after it for him.

107
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:17,833
Looking after it?

108
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,166
<i>What?</i>

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,966
<i>Eichi, is that true?</i>

110
00:07:24,766 --> 00:07:31,366
<i>Yes, I'm going to America with</i>
<i>my new dad and mom next week.</i>

111
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:33,666
<i>America?</i>

112
00:07:34,266 --> 00:07:35,833
<i>I'm sorry for keeping it from you,</i>

113
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:41,666
<i>but I wanted to tell it to you in person,</i>
<i>before I told everyone else.</i>

114
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,633
<i>No way...</i>

115
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:50,000
I was an emotional mess when Eichi
suddenly told me he was leaving.

116
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,900
And the night before
Eichi left...

117
00:07:56,166 --> 00:08:00,300
<i>Tonight is the last time we sleep</i>
<i>under the same roof, Mitsuki.</i>

118
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:01,733
<i>No...</i>

119
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:06,633
<i>I want to be with you tomorrow night,</i>
<i>and the one after that.</i>

120
00:08:07,466 --> 00:08:08,466
<i>Mitsuki...</i>

121
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:14,700
<i>It's not like we're going to</i>
<i>be separated forever.</i>

122
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:20,766
<i>Until we make our dreams come true,</i>
<i>our time together is just going to stop.</i>

123
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:26,433
<i>The next time we see each other,</i>
<i>our time will start to move again.</i>

124
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,566
<i>Until then, I'll leave this</i>
<i>with you, Mitsuki.</i>

125
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:34,000
It's been up there ever since that night.

126
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:39,200
The time between Eichi and I
has stopped there.

127
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:40,766
Is that so?

128
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,433
<i>That's why she keeps</i>
<i>that old calendar.</i>

129
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,833
Do you still talk with him?

130
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:52,233
I don't know where
he moved to in America.

131
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,833
Ms. Kazumi, do you know anything
about where he went?

132
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,500
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:01,433
I quit working at the orphanage
after getting married.

134
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,666
I see.

135
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:09,100
I know! I'll find him even if
I have to search all over America!

136
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,633
Really?

137
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,566
Oh, yes.

138
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,800
You and Eichi will always be
my dear students.

139
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:19,366
I'll do anything to help you!

140
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,666
Thank you so much, Ms. Kazumi!

141
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:23,300
Just leave it to me!

142
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:27,400
Now we have someone who can help us!
Right, Takuto?

143
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:32,166
So, what do you want to do
when you find Eichi?

144
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,866
Huh?

145
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,300
Since it's been two years,

146
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,433
you must have tons of things
you want to tell him, right?

147
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:38,433
Umm...

148
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,233
I don't know.

149
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:45,200
Well, then, think about it before
I go back to America.

150
00:09:45,466 --> 00:09:47,533
It's been a while, but it's
a homework assignment I'm giving you!

151
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:48,633
Okay!

152
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,300
<i>Maybe I'll find Eichi!</i>

153
00:09:58,933 --> 00:09:59,600
<i>And...</i>

154
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,066
<i>Mitsuki, I like you.</i>

155
00:10:03,433 --> 00:10:06,433
<i>Then, I can finally tell him "I like you,"</i>
<i>which I couldn't back then.</i>

156
00:10:09,566 --> 00:10:13,200
<i>Oh, yes! I have to hurry and think</i>
<i>about Ms. Kazumi's assignment.</i>

157
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,666
Did I serve a bad dish?

158
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,833
I'm doing fine.

159
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,233
Well, then...

160
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:24,433
Mitsuki, why are you spacing out?

161
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:25,700
Oh, yes!

162
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:27,866
Thank you so much for dinner!

163
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,966
W-Wait, Mitsuki, you're finished?
You barely touched anything!

164
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:36,033
I'm sorry.
I have homework to do.

165
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,066
Shall I write a letter?

166
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:41,233
A letter?

167
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:45,466
That's a great idea!
Letters are the most romantic!

168
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,500
Yes! What should I write?

169
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,266
What?

170
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,733
Do you think I have to write in English?

171
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:55,100
Of course Japanese is fine!

172
00:10:55,366 --> 00:10:56,933
Right. Good.

173
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,400
I wonder how Eichi is doing.

174
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:01,433
Let's see...

175
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:05,833
What if Eichi has become way more
handsome than in this picture?

176
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,800
I don't know what I'd do!

177
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:11,233
I wonder if he'd think that
I've become prettier.

178
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:13,400
Yes! He will! Of course he will!

179
00:11:13,433 --> 00:11:15,933
It's not like you're guaranteed
to find him, right?!

180
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:19,700
I'll be able to see him for sure!
Ms. Kazumi will find him.

181
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:23,400
In any case, it's not like
he'll be found today or tomorrow.

182
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,266
What's wrong?

183
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,300
Let's not even bother with guys that
don't understand girls' feelings!

184
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,566
More importantly, the letter, the letter!

185
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:32,300
Right!

186
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:34,033
Do as you please!

187
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,566
I'm fed up with this!

188
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:42,866
<i>What's so great</i>
<i>about this Eichi?</i>

189
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,033
<i>Well, this guy Eichi isn't just</i>
<i>a fantasy or an illusion.</i>

190
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:56,400
<i>I'll find him even if I have to</i>
<i>search all over America.</i>

191
00:11:58,266 --> 00:11:59,933
<i>Surely, you'll find him someday.</i>

192
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,633
Well, so what?!

193
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:05,933
Stupid me.

194
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:27,266
I see. You've decided
to write a letter?

195
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,200
I thought of doing that and tried to do it
all night long, but couldn't really...

196
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,900
What are you mad about?

197
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,200
Nothing.

198
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:36,966
I see. So that's why you came
to me seeking help.

199
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,766
Yes!

200
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,466
But I'm not sure if
I can be of any help.

201
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:44,333
But you have such
a wonderful husband.

202
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:46,033
You think so?

203
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,700
How did you tell him your feelings?

204
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,366
In my case,
I didn't use a letter, but that...

205
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:54,233
Huh?

206
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,133
A...video?

207
00:12:57,466 --> 00:12:59,733
That's right, I sent him a video-letter.

208
00:13:00,466 --> 00:13:02,233
More than writing a letter,

209
00:13:02,266 --> 00:13:06,333
I thought that sending the message directly
with words would convey more.

210
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,633
I see!

211
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:09,033
That's a great idea!

212
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:13,100
That way, you can show Eichi
how you sing when you're Full Moon!

213
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:17,100
Well, my story is just one example.

214
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:20,866
No, that was so helpful.
Thank you so much!

215
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,366
Ready... Start!

216
00:13:35,966 --> 00:13:39,466
Eichi, I've finally become a singer.

217
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,033
I'm always singing to you across the sea.

218
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,733
H-Hey! Stop !

219
00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:48,233
What are you doing, Takuto?

220
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:51,033
Hey! Why are you interrupting this?!

221
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:52,566
I don't like this at all!

222
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,033
What are you talking about?

223
00:13:54,866 --> 00:13:57,833
Why are you in a bad mood?
Are you hungry?

224
00:13:57,866 --> 00:13:59,666
Stupid, it's not that.

225
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,833
Well, then why?

226
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:05,100
Nothing, really.
What I really want to say is—

227
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,000
H-Hey! Let go of me!

228
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:08,633
Alrighty, don't bother us now.

229
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:12,433
Yes, yes, nothing gets done
when you mope around.

230
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,533
That's your favorite phrase, right?

231
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:16,433
How stupid.

232
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,266
Huh?!

233
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,700
Takuto!

234
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,000
Hey, I can't film like this.

235
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,066
I'm not going to help you anymore.

236
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
But...

237
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,700
Don't you think this is fake?

238
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:33,000
Using that huge camera and all.

239
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:35,233
If you really wanted to
deliver your message,

240
00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:37,533
shouldn't you show your true self?

241
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,900
My...true self?

242
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:43,966
Right! You're right!

243
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,333
- If you got it, then...
- Thanks, Takuto!

244
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:49,066
What?! Hey, wait!

245
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:52,733
Jeez... Did she really get it?

246
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,066
Oh, is this what you wanted?

247
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,200
Yes. This one is better than
the ones at the TV station.

248
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:00,933
Relax, Mitsuki.

249
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:03,733
So she really didn't get it!

250
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:08,500
Hey you, if all you're gonna do is complain,
can you please go away?

251
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:09,666
All right.

252
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:11,633
Okay, let's get started.

253
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,100
Ready... Start!

254
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,366
Eichi... Umm... How are you?

255
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,966
No, you're too stiff!
Relax like you were before.

256
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:25,300
When I'm not Full Moon,
I feel kind of shy.

257
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,033
Just relax, relax.
Okay, here we go again!

258
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,533
Eichi, how have you been?

259
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:36,533
I couldn't tell you two years ago,
but I've liked you for so long!

260
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:38,700
Hey! Are you taking this seriously?!

261
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:41,266
You really like him, right?

262
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,000
Then you've got to put
more feelings into it!

263
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,500
But you told me to relax.

264
00:15:46,766 --> 00:15:50,366
That's way too relaxed!
Just be your normal self.

265
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,466
You want to show how
you truly are, right, Mitsuki?

266
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:56,233
Yes! Once more, please!

267
00:15:56,766 --> 00:15:58,433
I'm ready when you are!

268
00:16:03,366 --> 00:16:05,066
Eichi, I like you.

269
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:12,533
Eichi, as we promised,
I am working hard to achieve my dreams.

270
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:19,266
I was determined to become a singer,
and I went to an audition as Full Moon.

271
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:23,866
Then, out of many applicants,
I was chosen.

272
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:26,600
These days,
I have put out two albums,

273
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:29,600
and I am participating in events
and performing at live shows.

274
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:34,266
I'm very busy every day with TV
and radio shows too.

275
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,666
I have fans that like my songs!

276
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:42,300
Full Moon is pretty popular
at school too.

277
00:16:43,366 --> 00:16:47,000
<i>So that's how it's been,</i>
<i>working towards my dreams!</i>

278
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,200
<i>Where are you,</i>
<i>and what are you doing now, Eichi?</i>

279
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,733
<i>I want to see you soon!</i>

280
00:16:53,633 --> 00:16:57,300
<i>I'm waiting for our time together</i>
<i>to start moving again.</i>

281
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,933
I'd say that's pretty good.

282
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:00,833
Yes!

283
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:03,900
Of course it is!
Because I directed it!

284
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,633
Ms. Oshige, I want to give this video
to Ms. Kazumi.

285
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,700
Her flight to America takes off
at 1 p.m., right?

286
00:17:12,933 --> 00:17:14,800
If you leave now,
we can make it without a problem.

287
00:17:19,733 --> 00:17:20,400
Hey!

288
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,300
Are you serious about delivering it?

289
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,266
Huh?

290
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:26,000
Hey, why are you still talking like that?

291
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,566
For one thing, this video has the real Mitsuki
and Full Moon all mixed up, right?

292
00:17:30,866 --> 00:17:34,700
How can Eichi believe that
Mitsuki is Full Moon?

293
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,300
I have to film the transformation too.

294
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:43,500
Is that okay with you, Mitsuki?

295
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:47,533
Yes... Eichi is so important to me.

296
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:55,466
I want to tell him the truth,
like I told you and Dr. Wakaoji.

297
00:17:56,433 --> 00:17:59,466
You're right.
So, let's hurry and film that too.

298
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:01,000
Takuto, please.

299
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:01,933
I refuse.

300
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:04,833
No way!
We came this far...

301
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:07,800
Takuto! Just stop your nonsense now!

302
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:11,133
Let me tell you this, you guys are
the ones that aren't making any sense!

303
00:18:11,366 --> 00:18:12,400
What do you mean?

304
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,933
Mitsuki... Something's wrong with you.

305
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:19,300
Didn't you decide to let Eichi find
you through your singing?

306
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:25,133
I sympathized with that feeling and
helped you turn into Full Moon.

307
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,900
You wanted him to notice you
through your singing,

308
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:30,633
so shouldn't you keep your word
and go on working on that?

309
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,500
Think about it.

310
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:41,900
Hey, where are you going?

311
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,100
Takuto!

312
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:54,333
Yes...that's right.
Takuto is right.

313
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,500
Mitsuki...

314
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,566
What am I doing?

315
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:06,033
Eichi wouldn't be happy
even if I sent this video to him.

316
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:08,800
Don't you need to go to the airport?

317
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:13,800
Isn't it better to give him
the video than to do nothing?

318
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:17,000
Everything will stay the same if you don't.

319
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,866
But...

320
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:19,466
Let's go Mitsuki!

321
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,133
There's no time to be indecisive!

322
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,900
How is it? Can we make it?

323
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:38,166
Traffic is kind of bad.
We might just barely make it.

324
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:03,900
<i>Your father conveyed his feelings</i>
<i>through this one song, right?</i>

325
00:20:06,233 --> 00:20:08,666
<i>Why don't you try to follow</i>
<i>this example, shorty?</i>

326
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,133
We made it.

327
00:20:19,766 --> 00:20:20,900
Come on, Mitsuki, hurry!

328
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,833
What's wrong, Mitsuki?

329
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:26,000
Ms. Oshige. Meroko...

330
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,866
I am not going to hand over
this video after all.

331
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:31,400
What are you talking about?!
We came all the way here!

332
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:35,133
I'm sorry. But Takuto is right.

333
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:39,400
I've decided to have Eichi notice me
through my songs.

334
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,366
So I want to keep singing,
believing that he will one day notice me!

335
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,500
Ms. Kazumi!

336
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:52,866
Mitsuki!

337
00:20:55,633 --> 00:20:58,033
I'm glad I made it in time.

338
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:04,633
Ms. Kazumi, if you find Eichi in America,
I want you to hand these to him.

339
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:07,466
Huh? These?

340
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:12,366
I think Eichi will understand once
he listens to those CDs.

341
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,700
This is the answer to the homework
you gave me.

342
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,966
I see. Okay.

343
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,966
I'll hand these to him for sure,
so just hang on till I contact you.

344
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,166
Okay!

345
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,000
Good! Very well done.

346
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,600
<i>Eichi... I'll sing...</i>

347
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,166
<i>Believing that the day will come</i>
<i>when you'll notice me.</i>

348
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:22,700
What?! Takuto!
You're all over Mitsuki again!

349
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:26,966
I can't help it! She has a gig
at the university festival,

350
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,466
and I have to protect her
as her bodyguard.

351
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,733
Shut up! You're the worst!
You're so mean, Takuto!

352
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:34,766
Meroko, calm down!

353
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,333
Whatever. I'll do my own thing!

354
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:41,066
You'll realize how great I am and apologize,
but it'll be too late!

355
00:23:41,733 --> 00:23:45,700
Next time on Full Moon:
"It's Autumn School Festival!"

356
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:47,200
- Look forward to it!
- Look forward to it!
