Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.69,0:05:30.94,Main,Kyosuke,0000,0000,0000,,Do you think it's easy to just make it at will?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.94,0:05:33.60,Main,Kyosuke,0000,0000,0000,,It's even more difficult than those professions with fixed boundaries.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.60,0:05:36.69,Main,Hiro,0000,0000,0000,,Professionals have to struggle with those boundaries.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.69,0:05:39.56,Main,Hiro,0000,0000,0000,,It's a different meaning from freedom gained without fighting.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.15,0:05:43.08,Main,Kyosuke,0000,0000,0000,,The area I want to fight in is different from yours!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.08,0:05:46.94,Main,Kyosuke,0000,0000,0000,,I want to make my film without being bound by the evaluation of the audience and judges!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.94,0:05:49.95,Main,Kyosuke,0000,0000,0000,,Do you only consider the readers when you draw?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.57,0:05:53.65,Main,Hiro,0000,0000,0000,,I'm also trying to draw something that I want to draw!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.65,0:05:56.94,Main,Hiro,0000,0000,0000,,It won't work if I only consider the readers, will it?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.94,0:05:59.57,Main,Hiro,0000,0000,0000,,Do you shoot your films without considering the audience?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.17,0:06:06.67,Main,Kyosuke,0000,0000,0000,,Whether it's just one scene or one cut, I want to make a film that shakes the souls of those who see it.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.73,0:06:12.39,Main,Kyosuke,0000,0000,0000,,For that sake, it won't work if that moment doesn't shake my own soul.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.80,0:06:15.80,Main,Hiro,0000,0000,0000,,If you say so, try and do it.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.80,0:06:17.52,Main,Kyosuke,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah, I will do it.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.15,0:06:24.27,Main,Kei,0000,0000,0000,,I didn't say that I would participate in the film.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.35,0:06:26.28,Main,Hiro&Kyosuke,0000,0000,0000,,Heh?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.71,0:06:28.81,Main,Kyosuke,0000,0000,0000,,Well, take your time and think about it.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.81,0:06:31.35,Main,Kei,0000,0000,0000,,It's pointless to wait for me, so please give up.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.91,0:06:34.23,Main,Kyosuke,0000,0000,0000,,Well then, I will look forward to your favorable reply.
