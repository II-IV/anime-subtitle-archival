00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:00,289
So, Komi... Uh... Um...

172
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,084
Just... You may take a seat
wherever you like.

173
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,586
[narrator] <i>She hasn't had a friend over
since grade school.</i>

174
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,683
- [narrator] <i>Tranquility.</i>
- [Nakanaka] <i>How peaceful.</i>

175
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:23,062
Ooh! Oh yeah! I'm at the climax
of this really cool video game!

176
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,648
- Would you like to watch me play it? Cool.
- [Komi sighs softly]

177
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,817
[beeps]

178
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,571
{\an8}[Nakanaka chuckles]
<i>Just check out these graphics!</i>

179
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,781
{\an8}<i>The latest games
have evolved to this level!</i>

180
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,576
{\an8}<i>What do you think of the visuals?
They're more beautiful than reality!</i>

181
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,035
{\an8}<i>Aren't you impressed?</i>

182
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:41,163
<i>Oh, let's not forget about the story!
Not only set in a profound world,</i>

183
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:44,500
<i>but so well written that the story never
loses focus from the central character.</i>

184
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,503
<i>I just know there will be no choice
but to cry in this final scene...</i>

185
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,839
- [narrator] <i>She doesn't understand.</i>
- Huh?!

186
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:55,052
[Nakanaka] <i>Oh, yeah.
You're a light user, an ordinary person!</i>

187
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:58,306
You can't fully appreciate
the latest technology in this game!

188
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,517
This is bad.
I just know you're going to tell me.

189
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,394
You are so boring.

190
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,021
{\an8}[Nakanaka] <i>I can't let this happen!</i>

191
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,356
{\an8}<i>She'll never come over again!</i>

192
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,483
<i>Wh-What should I do?!</i>

193
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,193
Aah!

194
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,571
Wh-Why don't I invite Najimi?

195
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,615
The more the merrier, don't you think?

196
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,575
{\an8}[narrator] <i>This is completely
out of character.</i>

197
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,953
I was summoned so here I am!

198
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,289
- Bump ba-daaa!
- Lame intro.

199
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,042
Oh, wow, it's been a while
since I've been here, Nakanaka!

200
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,335
Hey, Komi!

201
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,587
- Aah!
- And I brought Tadano with me, too!

202
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,298
Oh, but, um, boys are not...

203
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,383
[Tadano] Oh, yeah, I kinda thought so.

204
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,428
{\an8}It's okay. You'll barely notice he's here.

205
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,346
{\an8}[Tadano] What?

206
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,806
[Najimi] What do you wanna play?

207
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,351
{\an8}Since we're all here, let's play
something with four players.

208
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,853
{\an8}Hey! Why don't we play Swamp Bros?
Yeah, let's play that!

209
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,521
How come you get to decide?

210
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,773
[narrator] <i>What is Swamp Bros?</i>

211
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,317
<i>It's the short name of the game,
Combat: Swamp Brothers.</i>

212
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:55,029
<i>Known for its unique concept of throwing
your opponents into the swamp to win</i>

213
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,781
<i>and the variety of characters
you can play.</i>

214
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,659
It was so popular
back in elementary school, remember?

215
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,744
- We've played it before.
- [game character 1] <i>Najio!</i>

216
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,996
- Just who are you talking to?
- [game character 2] <i>Chuny!</i>

217
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,874
- I didn't play it that much.
- [game character 3] <i>Tadashi!</i>

218
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:09,960
- [grunts softly]
- [beeping]

219
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,004
[Tadano] <i>Right. I figured as much.</i>

220
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,339
[game character] <i>Komyusho!</i>

221
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:18,052
[Tadano] You press this button to defend,
and I think this one's for...

222
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,262
[Najimi] Whoo-hoo!

223
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,640
The great "Combat" fight
has already begun!

224
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,018
Komi! You're like a sitting duck here.

225
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:27,561
[thud]

226
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,479
[Najimi] Oh?!

227
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,273
[Nakanaka] I won't let you
lay a finger on my ally!

228
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,984
Finally, some competition!

229
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,404
Use that button right there to move.

230
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,947
- Hmm.
- [grunting in game]

231
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,408
- [Najimi grunting]
- [Komi gasps]

232
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,034
[Tadano] Yeah, there you go, you got it!

233
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,371
And now, uh, you can jump with this.

234
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,456
What are you doing Komi?

235
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,292
Hit the jump button repeatedly!
You gotta hit the jump button!

236
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,669
[Komi breathing heavily]

237
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,045
Now!

238
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,381
Since I invited Komi to my castle
as a guest,

239
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,383
I must make sure she leaves satisfied!

240
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,009
I won't let her be an easy target!

241
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,594
[Najimi scoffs] What a softie!

242
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,888
You haven't changed a bit
since elementary school!

243
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,974
[Najimi] I'll distract you with my combo!

244
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,350
- [grunts]
- Oh, shoot!

245
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,813
[Najimi chuckles]
Seems like I'm still one better than you.

246
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,816
- Now for the finishing blow.
- Huh?

247
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,777
[Nakanaka] Sure, I may have been like that
in elementary school.

248
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,738
But!

249
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,115
Now that I have someone to protect...

250
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,702
Defeat is not an option!

251
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,996
[Najimi]
Don't go underestimating this game

252
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,624
and kid yourself that you can win
with just with your feelings!

253
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:36,338
Oh, yeah. After the swamp,
you move slower because of the mud.

254
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,674
[Tadano] So, hit the R2 button.
Hit the R2--

255
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,676
[narrator] <i>She didn't mean to do that.</i>

256
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,637
[Tadano] Oh! Don't worry about it.
That's just how the game is.

257
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,847
This button right here.

258
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,558
- [grunts]
- Yeah! There you go!

259
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,144
[game music playing]

260
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,855
[Najimi] What? It's the mud cancel!

261
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,065
Who could be using
this advanced technique?!

262
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,026
[Nakanaka] I am right here!

263
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,694
[Najimi] Shoot!

264
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,492
[game announcer] <i>K.O.!</i>

265
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:06,952
Yes!

266
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,370
Oh, yes!

267
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,831
- I defeated Najimi!
- I lost...

268
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:14,794
[laughs] Would you look at that?
That's my first win!

269
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,420
[Nakanaka cackling]

270
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,172
{\an8}No way! That was pure dumb luck!

271
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,089
Whoa, what?

272
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,634
I just got a little distracted
by Komi's mud cancel!

273
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,677
You despicable sore loser!

274
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,805
[Najimi]
Maybe I'll play for real next round!

275
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:26,805
[Nakanaka] Bring it on!

276
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,724
I just finished my warm-ups myself!

277
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,351
[both grunting]

278
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,395
{\an8}MISSION 31
"IT'S JUST A PART-TIME JOB"

279
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,647
BEEP

280
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,987
HE

281
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,408
I'm so sorry to call on our day off!

282
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:49,745
{\an8}The person that was supposed to show up
canceled at the last minute.

283
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:53,874
{\an8}[Najimi] I asked around a bunch,
but everyone was super busy!

284
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,292
{\an8}Let's get started!

285
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,254
- Our mission, pass out tissue packets!
- [narrator] <i>She couldn't say no.</i>

286
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,298
We have to pass out 5,000 of these
by today.

287
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,466
[Komi gasps]

288
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,510
[Najimi] Well, we just have to
pass out tissues,

289
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,345
so you'll be fine with that, right, Komi?

290
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,264
I'm gonna go pass them out over there.

291
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,932
- Thanks for your help!
- [Komi gasps]

292
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,767
Have a tissue!

293
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,227
Here you go, take one!

294
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,771
Here you go! Here's some tissues!

295
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,148
How about a free tissue packet?

296
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,235
[narrator] <i>Motivation times two!</i>

297
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,987
[passerby 1]
Wow, that girl's really pretty.

298
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,447
[passerby 2] You're right!
I wonder what she's doing.

299
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:28,909
- [passerby 1| Passing out tissue packets?
- [passerby 2] Let's get one from her!

300
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,161
[passerby 1] It doesn't look like
she's passing them out.

301
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,872
[passerby 2] Then what is she doing?

302
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,915
[passerby 1]
Maybe we shouldn't talk to her.

303

Wait, hold on.
Was she just passing out tissues?

315
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,083
I should have taken one.

with someone soon!</i>

and now there's gum stuck on my shoe,</i>

I forgot to bring my handkerchief!</i>

passing out free tissue packets?!</i>

Good morning, everyone!

Good morning, Komi.
Love your look today as always, Goddess!

[laughing] What is it, Tadano?

390
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:13,819
So, you wanted to be with me that bad?

391

Najimi,
about the culture festival paperwork...

392
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,117
Najimi, that book I lent you...

393
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,327

[Tadano reading]

No, no, no, no, no!
That wouldn't feel right!

415
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,503
Because it feels rude to address a girl
by her first name!

416
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,464
[Najimi] Hey, so tell me, Tadano.

417
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,717
If that's the case,
are you saying that I'm not a girl?

418

All right! His first name!

Yeah, sure! Of course!

443

If she really wants to be called
by her first name,

then she should start doing it first!

445

[Tadano] Sounds fair.
