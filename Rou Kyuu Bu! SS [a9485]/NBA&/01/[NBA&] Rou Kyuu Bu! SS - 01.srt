Um... Well then!

183
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,850
Let's go.

184
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,670
Thank Black Jesus we made it.

185
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,810
Get the fuck out, old man

186
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,090
Um, are you okay?

187
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:52,040
Yes... But I dropped the bass

188
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,930
Are you Skrillex?

189
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,880
Excuse me!

190
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,770
He dropped his bass! Can you help us look for them?

191
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:04,960
Wub Wub Wub!

192
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,580
Is this it?

193
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:11,390
Yes, it is. Thank you very much.

194
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:15,080
It's fine. Thank  Black Jesus we found it.

195
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,690
I'm here to see my lil badonkadonk, but I guess I'm not used to the crowd.

196
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,820
I understand. I'm not good with crowds, either.

197
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,070
Thank you. You've been a great help.

198
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,280

Yo is dat Kevin Garnet?

201
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,320
What's good in the hood?

202
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,910
Look's like a ballin' time!

203
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,480
Is that a FAMAS?

204
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:52,950
Huh?

205
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,320

You got no aim

211
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,540
Let's go.

212
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,430
Wait, Trayvon!

213
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,890
These bitches givin' me a hard time

214
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,500
S'all good!

215
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,490
Can't Corner the Dorner!

216
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,250
You'll fall if you keep on leaning like that!

217
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,590
Yo! Dirk! Chris!

218
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,390

219
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,510

00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,740
It's yo own damn fault, nigga

226
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,630
Give it a shot, Chris

227
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,460
Make sure he gets a bangin' look at yer badonkadonk

228
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,280

230
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:16,070
You should tighten up your asshole a bit.

231
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,740
Okay!

232
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,270
So close!

233
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,030
That was close.

234
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:29,120
Yes, but thanks for the tip ;)

235
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,470
<i>Ah, I wanna taste a dick</i>

236
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,410
Off da heezy!

237
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:41,860

238
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,120
Yo!

239
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,530
I can see the hood from here!

240
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,990
This ghetto is unexpectedly nice.

241
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,560
The fireworks are about to happen.

242
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,520
Shit yes!

243
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,780
Kobe!

244
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,330
Sup dad?

245
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,770
I told you, the hood is very dangerous!

246
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,060
Fuck that

247
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,930
We're going home.

248
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,980
Stop right there criminal scum!

249
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,060
You're...

250
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:23,250
I'm the coach for the Lebron's Ballin' Academy's basketball team, Hasegawa Subaru.

251
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:27,880
I'm sorry for taking Kobe here.

252
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,620
Nah son, moms said I's cool

253
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:36,370
No, I broke her <s>hyemn</s> promise in the end.

254
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,790
I'm sorry.

255
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,910
But Kobe ain't no sleeze!

256
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,640
She gots skills and doens't afraid of anything

257
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,020
Subaru...

258
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:51,650
Oh, it seems like you're mackin' with my niglet?

259
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:56,070
I didn't bring her here because I wanted to break her promise with you.

260
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,720
I just want her to be with her homies

261
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,430
They're her precious homies

262
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,680
Homies, you say?

263
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,890
Kobe does not need friends who play ape-hoop!

264
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,580
Yo dads, cut it out!

265
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,900
Oh?

266
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,070
You're that guy...

267
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,310
You're Kobe's coach?

268
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:31,060
Yes, I coach these niggas

269
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,100
We need Kobe!

270
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,300
Yeah!

271
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,830
I wouldn't be a sick baller without Kobe!

272
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:44,460
I love Kobe, too! I love being with all mah negroes

273
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:49,880
Kobe is the glue that keeps dis hood 2gether

274
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:55,000
Yo dads, my B

275
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,140
It's cause of Subaru I'm havin' a bangin' time playin' hoop

276
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,380
That's why...

277
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,820
You can take Kobe outta the hood but you can't take the hood outta Kobe

278
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,410
Please!

279
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,590
Don't bother coming home tonight, son

280
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,820
Daddy.....

281
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,470
Hey!

282
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,720
I think you know already.

283
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,640
Ape-hoop had left Kobe a terrible memory before.

284
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:42,570
But it seems like she found some great friends through ape-hoop this time.

285
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,130
This is unbefitting of me to say.

286
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:50,240
But please take care of my daughter.

287
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,950
Yes!

288
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,830

00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,670
Let's continue with our promise. ya dig?

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,200
Did something good happen?

00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,200
Pops said to hit some young jeezy's in B-ball!

295
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,490
She's so pretty

296
