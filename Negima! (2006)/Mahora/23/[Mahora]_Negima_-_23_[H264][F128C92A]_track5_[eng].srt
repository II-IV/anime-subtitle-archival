1
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,740
I'm home.

2
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,920
Everyone is out again.

3
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,510
Nekane-san!

4
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,720
Yeah! I'm fine!

5
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,060
How's Negi?

6
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,350
He's crying because his job is too hard, isn't he?

7
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,230
Eh?

8
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,400
Oh. I see. So things are going well.

9
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,570
And he has lots of friends. Is... that so?

10
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,610
I was so worried.

11
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,030
Eh? Here?

12
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,660
Yeah! Of course everything is fine!

13
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,160
Everything's going well.

14
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,960
Divination is really thriving these days.

15
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,210
I also made friends with everyone on stage!

16
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,160
Et Clio Illios!

17
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,720
The magical item that even the Thousand Master cannot use...

18
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,700
If I can use this...

19
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,770
What if I fail?

20
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,650
But... At this rate, I'll lose!

21
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,400
For me to lose...

22
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,990
Anything but that!

23
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,780
I will beat Negi!

24
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,960
The devil's gem—that is the Star Crystal.

25
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,440
Amoris!

26
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,610
The last of the fairy fragments suddenly appeared...

27
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,910
and combined with the other fragments to turn into the Shriek of the Soul.

28
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,450
Finally! The Star Crystal has been awakened!

29
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:44,380
And so, Evangeline, possessed by the Darkness, addresses Negi.

30
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,590
Eva-san!

31
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,090
Negi, it's me.

32
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:49,850
Anya!

33
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,430
I will not lose! I will not lose to you!

34
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,560
Never...

35
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,560
Anya...

36
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,610
Note: There is a second subtitle stream with translation notes.

37
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,570
"Hold on, that's not what I meant Negi-kun!"

38
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,610
by Yuuna.

39
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,150
"That's right! I'm your parter after all!"

40
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,610
by Ako.

41
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,330
Stop it, Anya!

42
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,370
It's useless, Nekane-kun.

43
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,790
I won't let you get in my way.

44
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,220
They turned to stone!

45
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,100
Anya, how could you...?!

46
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,520
Master!

47
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,980
Chachamaru-san!

48
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,070
Mas...ter...

49
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,820
Anya, stop this!

50
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,240
Anya!

51
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,910
Aniki! Look out!

52
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,690
Asuna-san!

53
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,710
Negi, let me transform!

54
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,940
I'll fight!

55
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,420
But...

56
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,430
Believe in your partner!

57
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,310
She’s going to shoot again! Aniki!

58
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:14,810
Negi!

59
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,350
Partner: Kagurazaka Asuna.

60
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,020
Show me the power... within you!

61
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,990
Contract...

62
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,970
Activate!

63
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,140
It's an Armor Card!

64
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,600
You... You... You!

65
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,350
Asuna-san, be careful.

66
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,360
She disappeared!

67
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,730
A kiss?!

68
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,920
It broke! The contract is broken!

69
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,060
Ane-san...

70
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,900
No way...

71
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,780
Now this girl will be my servant.

72
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,650
Now, defeat Negi for me.

73
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,280
Aniki!

74
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,950
Asuna-san!

75
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,710
Negi-kun!

76
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:03,870
Asuna-san!

77
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,380
She's possessed by the Darkness, de gozaru!

78
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,130
Nekane-san and Takahata-sensei are…

79
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,510
....turned to stone!

80
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,800
Why?!

81
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,060
Everyone! Please get out of here!

82
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,850
It's good to have lots of friends, huh, Negi?

83
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,560
Please run!

84
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,440
We know, but...

85
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,560
I’ll be fine.

86
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,440
So just hurry!

87
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,820
Everyone! Seriously, we have to run!

88
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,440
But I don't want to ditch him like that!

89
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,680
I... I'm hit!

90
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,140
Chamo-kun!

91
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,830
Ojou-sama, this place is...

92
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,160
We must leave this instant, de gozaru!

93
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,250
NO!!

94
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,770
Please forgive me.

95
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:46,770
Nin!

96
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,230
Fleeing is futile.

97
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,260
Anya!

98
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,260
Negi...

99
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,220
I'll make you lonely too.

100
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,720
Lonely like me!

101
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:03,980
Amoris!

102
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,510
Asuna-san, I'm sorry.

103
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,690
Aniki!

104
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,740
Are you okay?

105
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,510
I'm totally fine!

106
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,700
Aniki...

107
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,870
It's alright!

108
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,250
If you cancel the magic, everyone will return to normal!

109
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,220
The class student list...

110
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,530
Everyone, please hear me out.

111
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,970
Evangeline-san is currently controlled by the Darkness.

112
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,270
She is currently targeting all of you.

113
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,770
And she wants to petrify you using magic.

114
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,770
It's dangerous, so please hide in any nooks or crannies you can find!

115
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,400
I will definitely defeat the Darkness...

116
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,050
...so that everyone can come with me back to the real world!

117
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:03,040
All 31 of you from class 3-A, let's go home together!

118
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,040
So until then, please hide yourselves!

119
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,000
Aniki…

120
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,460
Even if he tells us to hide...

121
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,920
We can't just leave Negi-sensei like that.

122
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,640
Alright! Let’s go to Negi-sensei!

123
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,050
Okay... Oh!

124
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,760
Evangeline!

125
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,770
What should we do?

126
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,100
She looks like she’s in pain.

127
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,790
Sakurako!

128
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,770
She fainted.

129
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,690
Has the Darkness left her body?

130
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,070
Maybe...

131
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,950
That's why she fainted...

132
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,660
Let's take her to be examined!

133
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,910
Just kidding.

134
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,290
I'm sorry, everyone.

135
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,410
Let's go Chamo-kun.

136
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,420
Yeah.

137
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,470
Mana.

138
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,270
What?

139
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,930
Maybe we shouldn't be hiding after all, aru!

140
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,940
Let's go save Negi-bouzu, aru!

141
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,310
Don't say that now!

142
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,480
No feeling at all...

143
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,200
Who was it that told us to hide quickly?

144
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
It's not "Who".

145
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,280
It's Kuu Laozi, aru!

146
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,830
Kuu Laozi will always be black.

147
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,750
That's funny, aru!

148
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,330
Silence! We'll be discovered!

149
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,840
Ho ho!

150
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,510
All of them became stone.

151
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,800
The parents would certainly be happy about this.

152
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,800
That’s right.

153
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,930
By the way, haven’t you received a response for that emergency call, ~mya?

154
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,060
You don’t have to look so surprised, ~mya.

155
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,690
We've been petrified!

156
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,980
We’re hit!

157
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,940
In a good way!

158
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,200
Aniki...

159
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,890
At this rate, everyone in the class will be...

160
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,620
Anya...

161
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,140
It's going to the Science Lab.

162
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,720
Hello, this is Yuuna.

163
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,890
Got it.

164
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,350
We will now pursue and observe.

165
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,230
Please be careful.

166
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,020
Eva-san is currently on her way to the Science Lab.

167
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,150
Haruna-san, found it yet?

168
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,060
♪ Tokimeki Fanfare~

169
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,110
I haven't found it yet...

170
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,680
♪ Fanfare~

171
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,110
...even though we should have seen it by now.

172
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:50,830

No, this is no accident.

274
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:23,520
Our strong feelings for Negi-sensei guided the magic down the path of success!

275
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,350
Stop exaggerating! It's embarrassing...

276
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:31,610
Now that we have done this, we can really be your partners now!

Why?!

308
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,840
What do you mean why? You did it, too.

309
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,840
Though I doubt you remember.

310

We’re now partner-buddies, right, Eva-san?

Negi-kun!

317
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,780
Don't touch the stone!!

318
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,490
Negi!

319
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,290
Negi-sensei has been taken by the Star Crystal!

320
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,120
No way...

321
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,000
Negi!!!

322
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,840
Everyone! Look outside!

323
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,840
It's the forest, desu!

324
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,840
That is...

325
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,930
The forest of Wales.

326
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,930
Negi got sucked in by the Star Crystal,

327
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:55,980
and suddenly the forest of Wales appears in front of everyone!

328
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:00,940
Next is the climax! Keep your eyes open for the next episode!

329
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,100
We might have something interesting here!

330
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,290
With full mental concentration in Yoga,

331
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,210
even fire can turn cold.

Next time, “Negi-sensei, looks like it's the climax now,” by Akira.

333
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:50,380
"Let's all go home together, okay, Negi-kun?"

334
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,640
by Misora.

335
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,180
Alright, now it's time!

336
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,970
Oh, so that was just for the ramen.

337
