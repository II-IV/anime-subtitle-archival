1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,170
A morning stroll sure feels good, de gozaru.

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:10,820
Yeah!

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,770
Yahoo…!

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,480
A few days later…

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,830
The students of Class 3-A have returned to the real world, as well as a normal and peaceful life.

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,920
Hey… We’re gonna be late again…

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,000
Gimme 5 more minutes…

8
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,250
You just said 5 minutes a while ago.

9
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,340
Then gimme 10 minutes…

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,340
Things’ll get bad if we keep postponing…

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,110
Ojou-sama…

12
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,110
I have come to escort you.

13
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,580
Morning, Secchan.

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,300
Asuna, hurry and get up already!

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,300
Asuna!

16
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,110
Gimme 15 more minutes…

17
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,650
She’s pushing it again.

18
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,480
Problem solved.

19
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,000
Secchan, I don’t think that’s really good.

20
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,040
Ain’t it peaceful?

21
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,590
That time, when that light saved us…

22
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,170
Could it be…

23
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,050
Anya…

24
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,450
“So does this mean… Case Closed!?”

25
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,070
by the Narrator

26
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,280
Justice has been served for the Case of the Star Crystal.

27
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,560
Mmm, good work.

28
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,360
So, um, Principal…

29
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,990
Regarding Anya…

30
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,020
We were just about to get to that, ~mya.

31
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,880
Oh, everything has been settled.

32
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,210
Didn’t I mention eveything’s been settled already?

33
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,260
I’ve already spoken with the Magic Academy about this.

34
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,350
Is that sufficient enough?

35
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,350
If the school principal has done so, then I have no objections.

36
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,470
Thank you very much.

37
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,540
Just think of this as another task.

38
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,690
But Negi sure has some very difficult tasks on his shoulders.

39
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,150
That’s true. Especially when he was turned into a Chupacabra.

40
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,320
He was probably extremely bitter.

41
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,190
We, as the delegates from the Magic Academy who wait for something to eat,

42
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,620
have no intention of protesting Negi-san’s diligence.

43
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,660
In a good way.

44
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,930
Although, he doesn’t really mean it, ~mya.

45
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,370
What are you trying to reveal!?

46
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,970
It’s already exposed, ~mya.

47
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,180
Alright. Let’s review everything until now.

48
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,550
So it’s true.

49
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:17,660
I heard about Negi from you. But I didn’t believe it.

50
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,440
I thought that things weren’t going well,

51
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,410
and he was crying by himself.

52
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,360
Anya…

53
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,310
And now, Satsuki-san, can you read the next one?

54
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,870
Satsuki-san?

55
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,160
Ah! I’m sorry!

56
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,660
That’s rare. I’ve never seen you fall asleep in class.

57
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,810
That’s so true. It’s really rare…

58
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,450
…that Asuna is awake.

59
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,960
Right, Asuna?

60
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,550
Oh… She’s sleeping.

61
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:53,060
I’m sorry. I was planning today’s party menu until late last night…

62
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,780
Ah, is that right?

63
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,390
There’s nothing we can do about that, is there?

64
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,890
Anyway, ’jou-chan, we’ll be looking forward to a fantastic meal from you today!

65
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:01,920
Yep.

66
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,520
We’re having a party?

67
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,990
Ah, we haven’t told you have we, Anya.

68
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,950
Let’s have fun with everyone tonight.

69
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,410
We thought it would be nice to have some entertainment.

70
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,660
Anya-chan, please join us, okay?

71
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,450
Okay.

72
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,440
Alright, that’s all for today’s class.

73
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,550
Okay!

74
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,990
Alright! Time to do today’s party preparations!

75
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,930
Yay, Party! It’s gonna be exciting!

76
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,560
Yeah. Exciting, indeed.

77
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,270
We’ve come back from the magic world safely after all, no?

78
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,880
Anya?

79
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,710
What happened?

80
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,420
Wasn’t the magic world a bad place?

81
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,860
What should we do? Did we say something wrong?

82
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,370
Anya-chan… I wonder if she still feels responsible for what happened…

83
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,820
I’ll go.

84
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,470
Negi…

85
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,550
I’ll be able to talk to Anya.

86
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,270
Everyone, please start without me.

87
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,120
Iinchou-san, I’ll leave it to you.

88
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,870
Wait, Negi I’m coming, too.

89
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,840
Me too.

90
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,780
I’m coming as well.

91
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,310
Leave it to me, Negi-sensei…

92
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,250
I will make the perfect party for you! ♥

93
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,360
RIGHT, EVERYONE!?

94
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,690
Yeah!

95
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,670
There she is!

96
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,320
Anya!

97
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,650
Wait, Anya!

98
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,010
Don’t follow me!

99
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,410
Stop it!

100
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,160
Wait, I want to talk to you!

101
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:36,360
Don’t come any closer!

102
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,080
Lilios!

103
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,970
Is this the Invisible Leaf Technique of the Igaryuu Stream!?

104
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,160
It’s magic.

105
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,810
Anya…

106
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,990
Right, I got it!

107
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,510
Sayo-chan, please take care of these.

108
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,810
Okay~

109
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,350
How does this look?

110
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,200
Perfect!

111
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,890
Sayo-san, can you reach that?

112
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,600
Of course!

113
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,000
Done!

114
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,220
Would you like me to do that?

115
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,290
Really, aru? Thanks for the help, then, aru!

116
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,360
It’s so nice to be able to fly…

117
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,520
I’m jealous, desu~!

118
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,540
If the two of you become ghosts, you’ll be able to fly as well!

119
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,860
Right, done!

120
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,700
Misa, you’re fast.

121
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,690
Just leave this stuff to me.

122
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,850
I FAIL…

123
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,150
I ripped it again…

124
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,030
Sakurako, you’re so clumsy.

125
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,910
What about you, Madoka?

126
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,500
That’s awesome!

127
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,350
You really did it, didn’t you?

128
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,290
Huh? Who made all that?

129
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:06,840
Huh?

130
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,320
Fold a mountain… Fold a valley… Fold a mountain… And we seem to be folding a valley…

131
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,220
He’s an expert. In a good way.

132
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,300
Even though he’s a frog…

133
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,280
It’s <i>because</i> I’m a frog.

134
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,780
Alright, everyone!

135
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,730
Have you guys been reading Chiu-Chiu’s Drifting Diary?

136
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,990
My heart is beating out of excitement!

137
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,230
When I was in the magic world, I thought up a lot of things!

138
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,270
Once you start reading it, you won’t stop, ~pyon!

139
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,640
Whoa! The access numbers have climbed.

140
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,780
GOOD JOB! As expected of me.

141
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,750
Hmm, let’s see, how is the response?

142
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,300
WHO ARE YOU CALLING A WAVE GROUP!?

143
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,210
At the very least…

144
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,930
CALL ME WONDER GIRL OR SOMETHING!!!

145
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,440
Ahhh… Wonder Girl!

146
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,470
Cabbages, tomatoes, long beans, onions, lettuce and carrots…

147
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,610
Is that all?

148
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,200
Akira, what does Satsuki’s memo say?

149
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,590
We still need green bell peppers.

150
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,020
But we don’t have any…

151
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,380
Ah! Let’s try planting some now!

152
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,030
Then we’ll have lots!

153
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,490
This isn’t the magic world…

154
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,880
Yeah… you’re right…

155
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,050
They think they’re going to win!

156
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:20,990
Let’s teach ’em a lesson!

157
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,690
She’s the same here and in the magic world…

158
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,740
The tracks got caught in the mud!

159
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,880
Is this some curse of a witch!?

160
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,410
Stop playing around and help us, Yuuna!

161
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,150
Sir! Yes, Sir!

162
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,340
Makie-san, won’t you be a dear and set the dishes?

163
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,630
Okay~

164
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,160
I wonder where the forks are.

165
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,270
They’re all in this cabinet.

166
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,240
What about the juice?

167
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,060
Is this alright?

168
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,810
What’s wrong, Iinchou?

169
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,340
Makie-san! Why are you performing so well today?

170
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,700
Eh? I shouldn’t?

171
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:02,950
You are a failure that keeps making me very angry, Sasaki Makie.

172
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,700
A Sasaki Makie who’s not a failure should always be a failure who is Sasaki Makie!

173
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,130
I don’t get it, but…

174
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,280
You’re really pushing it, aren’t you?

175
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,890
Wait, Anya! Listen to us!

176
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,830
Lilios!

177
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,490
She’s done it now…

178
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,500
I’m <i>so</i> gonna catch you and teach you a lesson!

179
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,250
Asuna’s just changed her motive…

180
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,650
Anya…

181
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,300
Alas! Being good friends is a beautiful thing!

182
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,110
by the Principal

183
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:50,960
Here.

184
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,000
Please hand these out to everyone.

185
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,100
What are these…?

186
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,470
Aren’t these some kind of vampire potions?

187
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,470
That’s exactly right.

188
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,540
Really?

189
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:04,110
These were made by Master a long time ago to become an adult,

190
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,220
but eventually failed in the end.

191
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,180
The latter was unnecessary.

192
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,520
That means these are inferior goods?

193
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,540
Yes. Because it was a failure, they’ve became youth potions instead.

194
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,970
Youth potions?

195
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,560
It’s something I don’t need. So you guys can have it.

196
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,540
So if we drink it, we’ll get younger?

197
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,710
No. Your age will not change.

198
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,950
So what becomes young then?

199
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,390
The age of your skin.

200
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,210
What? Your skin gets younger?

201
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,440
That’s very interesting.

202
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,100
I’ll take one!

203
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,360
Let me have one, too!

204
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,460
Waah! My skin is so smooth!

205
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,670
So tender… like a baby’s skin!

206
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,330
It feels like its transparent!

207
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,470
With this, I’m not afraid of UV rays anymore!

208
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,000
Amazing… Amazing!

209
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,330
This is a girl’s ultimate weapon!!

210
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,040
These are very interesting results…

211
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,500
The contents of this medicine are…

212
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,470
This is awesome…

213
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:19,980
Extracts from chordates, anhemitonics, salamander type, eyelashes.

214
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,980
So cool…

215
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,020
Newts.

216
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,400
And, vertebrates, something with good eyes…

217
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,410
Flying fox.

218
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:35,810
And an animal from temperate regions,

219
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:36,990
Roundback slug.

220
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:45,540
Right, right. I’ll join the crowd since this seems worth trying out.

221
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,050
I think there’s also a frog in there, ~mya.

222
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,090
Just kidding, ~mya.

223
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,160
There <i>is</i> a frog in there.

224
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,240
You’re annoying.

225
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,030
Hey Chizu-nee, what should we get for party gifts?

226
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,370
I have already decided.

227
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,370
Here!

228
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,800
Ah! Pretty!

229
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,600
So you’ll give a ribbon as a present?

230
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,200
You. Are. Wrong!

231
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,480
There we go! All done!

232
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,980
ME!?

233
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,490
Secret present is a cigarette.

234
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,080
13 points.

235
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,960
Recently, are points harder to get?

236
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,970
People grow up over time.

237
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,460
Growing up, eh…

238
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,720
Maana.

239
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,960
4 points.

240
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,970
1 million points…

241
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,060
Today is a happy day. Today I shall create Lingshen’s special meat buns!

242
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,060
Wow, what kind of meat bun?

243
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,860
The buns that contain what I think are the tastiest of all!

244
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,450
I can’t wait!

245
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,810
So, what ingredient is the tastiest of all?

246
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,310
Ta-da!

247
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,840
The tastiest of all is meat buns!

248
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,840
These are recursive meat buns!

249
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,150
Meat bun in a meat bun!

250
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,880
So what’s inside the inner meat bun?

251
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,200
Of course, another meat bun!

252
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,440
And that’s considered a meat bun still…?

253
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,980
So, will you guys help me?

254
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,960
Let us feast on the World’s Delicacy Noodles that gives the world a power up!

255
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,430
Chachamaru, get rid of him.

256
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,150
Yes, Master.

257
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,370
We’ve lost sight of her.

258
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,930
I wonder where Anya-chan went…

259
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,680
She should have passed by here just now…

260
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,540
What’s wrong, Aniki?

261
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,870
I sense magic somewhere…

262
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,850
But I don’t know where…

263
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,690
Negi! Duck!

264
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,480
What was that!?

265
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,130
Darkness?

266
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
Lilios!

267
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,840
Anya!

268
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,480
I told you not to come, but you wouldn’t listen!

269
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,230
Why is the darkness…

270
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,750
The Star Crystal should’ve been sealed, right?

271
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,470
There’s still some darkness remaining.

272
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,770
But that reaction was…

273
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:22,820
Yes. Only those who were captured by the Star Crystal like me would understand.

274
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,190
Why didn’t you tell us?

275
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,320
We could help you…

276
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,040
No!

277
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,530
This is something I must take care of myself.

278
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,320
Anya…

279
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,080
One more and they should be gone.

280
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,730
Don’t get in my way!

281
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,010
W-What—?

282
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,540
Haat aar yuu duing!

283
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,650
You are the one getting in our way! What are you babbling about?

284
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,040
Thtop iit!

285
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,550
That’s right! You’re just like Negi, trying to think that you can do everything by yourself!

286
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,050
We’re gonna help. Got it?

287
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,780
But… Then I’ll be a burden.

288
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,560
What are you talking about? We’re friends, right?

289
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:08,980
Friends…?

290
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,250
That’s right, Anya-san.

291
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,110
When we’re friends, nothing we do is a burden.

292
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,470
Anya.

293
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:22,980
Run!

294
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:29,950
You guys…

295
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,960
So there was something as big as THIS left over…

296
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,550
The center of the darkness is…

297
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,940
Gotcha!

298
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,950
Argh, ouch ouch ouch… That was stubborn.

299
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,790
That was bad!

300
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,680
Are you alright, Ojou-sama?

301
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,130
We said we’d help, but ended up getting saved and taken care of.

302
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,210
Are you all right?

303
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,870
Thank you, Anya.

304
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:12,810
You saved us…

305
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,840
Well, it’s our turn now.

306
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,040
Negi-kun…

307
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,310
Please, let us transform!

308
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,670
Very well.

309
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:32,700
Partner: Kagurazaka Asuna, Konoe Konoka, Sakurazaki Setsuna;

310
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,740
Show me the power within yourselves!

311
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,200
Contract, activate!

312
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,180
All Cosplay Cards…

313
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,390
Anya, what should we aim for?

314
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,390
There!

315
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,730
Got it. We’ll clear the route!

316
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,640
Anya, get on!

317
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,820
Secchan!

318
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,450
Hidden Technique: Walking Eyes! Attack!

319
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,310
Now! Anya!

320
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,530
Del

321
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,530
Clio

322
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,530
Lilios!

323
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,140
We did it!

324
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,630
Ahhh, I’m so hungry.

325
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,900
My tummy is growling, too!

326
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,390
What’s up, you guys?

327
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,920
Open it.

328
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,540
Come on, just do it.

329
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,640
Okay…

330
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:16,790
Welcome to Mahora Academy Girl’s Junior High, Class 3-A!

331
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,040
Come this way, de gozaru.

332
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,750
Wha—?

333
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,930
Don’t be scared, aru! This is a reception, aru!

334
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,510
Reception?

335
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,330
Then the thing about you guys coming back is…

336
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,940
That was a lie.

337
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:37,160
We wanted it to be a surprise so we kept it a secret.

338
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,140
It was actually a party for you, Anya-chan!

339
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,890
Me?

340
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,550
You didn’t look happy after you came back…

341
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,990
We thought that you wouldn’t be able to have fun with us without a proper reception, desu!

342
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,640
That’s it.

343
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,520
Sorry we were keeping it from you.

344
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,890
Everyone gathered for you.

345
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,890
Master as well.

346
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,330
You don’t have to say unnecessary things.

347
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,390
Anya…

348
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,890
Thank you!

349
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,770
Alright, everyone, in the meantime…

350
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:18,860
Ready, and…

351
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,860
Cheers!

352
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,910
This is a good class, huh?

353
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:24,850
Yes.

354
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,850
It’s Negi-kun’s class, that’s why.

355
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,550
By the way, what’s up with you?

356
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,810
Ah well, um…

357
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:43,120
In the end, we have a grand finale. Here, smiles from Mahora Academy Girls Junior High Class 3-A have gathered.

358
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:47,850
Ah, that’s right! I found this when we were out hunting the darkness in the woods.

359
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,570
Here, it’s a present!

360
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,570
For me?

361
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,600
Is that a magic egg?

362
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,600
What’s inside?

363
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,110
Lilios!

364
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,170
Run~ya!

365
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,400
A Chupacabra?

366
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,020
You were looking for one right?

367
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,530
Run~ya…

368
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:13,830
Run~ya!

369
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,260
Can we get that kind of stuff here?

370
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,050
As long as there is love, miracles can happen!

371
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,060
As long as there is love…

372
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,040
AS LONG AS THERE IS LOVE…

373
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,170
What are you doing, Secchan?

374
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,540
That’s great for Asuna-san, isn’t it?

375
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:31,940
Who would’ve thought Chupacabras actually existed!

376
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,730
Make sure you Run~ya!

377
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,120
5 points.

378
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,550
Alright!

379
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:14,380
This time we have successfully produced genuine Chupacabra-signed T-shirts!!

380
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,290
Now, get 500 of those signed, good luck!

381
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,880
…by the end of today, okay?

382
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,430
Asuna, you monster…

383
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,190
The “Chu” became “Cha,” run~ya!
