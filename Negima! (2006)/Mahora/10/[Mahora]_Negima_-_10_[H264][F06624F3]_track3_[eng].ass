Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.96,0:00:20.51,N_Pri,Dean,0000,0000,0000,,I believe that is a crystallized Cry of the Spirit.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.84,0:00:29.30,N_Neg,Negi,0000,0000,0000,,Does that mean that someone captured by the Star Crystal became a Cry of the Spirit and brought forth that darkness..?

Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.57,0:00:40.63,N_Tak,,0000,0000,0000,,but if that’s a fragment of the Cry of the Spirit, then that person is under the control of some other person’s will.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.15,0:00:45.01,N_Eva,Eva,0000,0000,0000,,To put it in simple terms, the person’s possessed.

Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.95,0:01:04.93,N_Eva,Eva,0000,0000,0000,,Well, if it is the Star Crystal, we can’t possibly handle it.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.23,0:01:09.53,N_Eva,,0000,0000,0000,,Why? Because that's something even the Thousand Master couldn’t deal with.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.43,0:01:17.46,N_Pri,Dean,0000,0000,0000,,Anyway, are they targeting the Academy? Or something else?

Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.87,0:01:48.19,N_Pri,Narrator,0000,0000,0000,,What’s more, what about the true identity of the crafty Black Rose Baron?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.19,0:01:51.30,N_Pri,,0000,0000,0000,,Could he really be a figment of Negi’s thoughts and feelings?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.30,0:01:55.47,N_Pri,Narrator,0000,0000,0000,,The mystery can only go deeper.
