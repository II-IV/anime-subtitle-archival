1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,690
The students’ transformation that happened in the past few days…

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,510
…looks like it had something to do with the darkness.

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,110
Did you notice anything related to it?

4
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,120
There is a disturbance in the magnetic field.

5
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,630
I have a bad feeling about this world.

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,120
Is it an omen?

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,350
I don’t know.

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,130
But we need to be careful.

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,470
Eva…

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,970
I’m going back to sleep.

11
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,570
Is she feeling ill or something?

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,900
She has had a headache since this morning.

13
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:53,580
Is this an omen of the terrible situation that was just mentioned?

14
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:59,200
Perhaps Takamichi and Chachamaru don’t realize it. Well, in a good way.

15
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:04,120
Hey Chachamaru-kun, are you sure it’s actually a headache?

16
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,910
I’m sure of it.

17
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,920
by Satsuki

18
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,050
Darkness is on the move again?

19
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,360
Really!?

20
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,890
I don’t know what’s going to happen from here on.

21
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,610
We should be careful.

22
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,410
Anyway, what is this?

23
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,560
Does it have something to do with the investigation of The Darkness?

24
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,470
Nope, that’s not it.

25
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,320
I found it in the kitchen.

26
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,330
Oh it’s food…

27
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:02,410
Squid Cutlets, pickles, oiled sardines, dried mullet roe, pistachio...

28
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,420
It’s just a delicacy right?

29
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,040
I think I might be able to make the Worldwide Original Ramen.

30
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,300
Ramen!?

31
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:10,890
Yep.

32
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,920
I’ll call it the World Ramen Delicacy. If I can make it taste nice, I’ll treat you guys to it.

33
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,130
Er… Yeah! I’ll look forward to it!

34
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,790
The Darkness is still spreading, but you’re being so carefree…

35
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,210
A calm mind, is an important asset for all situations.

36
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,130
Oh… Now that you say it, yeah… that seems to be the case.

37
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,570
Yeah. The fairy in the fragment manipulated people in our class.

38
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,480
I think Chisame was also manipulated before, right?

39
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,620
That’s true, but when I was being manipulated, I didn’t realize what was going on.

40
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,790
I just thought of this. What kind of standards are we choosing anyway?

41
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,830
Standards?

42
00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:00,050
Ah. I see. The people manipulated by the fairy may have some common traits.

43
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:06,260
Hmm, that might be a hint to the puzzle of the fragments, eh?

44
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,220
Common traits… like?

45
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,940
Everyone really wants to see Chisame-chan as a Net Idol!

46
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,190
That’s wrong! I am not a Net Idol!

47
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,340
Not a Net Idol, eh?

48
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,200
Really?

49
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,340
But the person in question has the same weight!

50
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,170
Chizuru-san…

51
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:32,620
Oh yeah! Natsumi was also manipulated! Let’s hear it from her!

52
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,930
Err, it’s not that important.

53
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,920
Yeah. Not that important.

54
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,740
I don’t think that’s the case.

55
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,190
Ara, is that right? Hmm…

56
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,180
Aha, that’s right, if that’s the case, then I’m stupid!

57
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,560
Ah, you got mail.

58
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,270
It’s Chizu-nee!

59
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,840
Ehhhh!?

60
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,400
That’s quite cold of her…

61
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,570
Hey, Misora-chan, this pose is…

62
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,940
Do not speak.

63
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,700
Misora-chan, um…

64
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,070
Do not speak.

65
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,450
Misora…

66
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,580
Don’t!

67
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,980
Huh!? No!?

68
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,010
I’m not good!?

69
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,250
I’m a failure!?

70
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,900
YES! You ARE a failure.

71
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,330
You, Sasaki Makie, fails at life!

72
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,960
You don’t have to force it into here you know…

73
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,230
Doing things halfway makes you feel bad doesn’t it?

74
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,540
Sasaki Makie fails!

75
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,130
Ah! Negi-sensei! Where are you going?

76
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,850
Ah! Class Rep! I’m just…

77
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,740
Evangeline is sleeping with a headache.

78
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,970
Eva-san?

79
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,380
Don’t do that Chamo-kun!

80
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,590
We already promised Takamichi that we won’t tell anyone!

81
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,980
Ah! I forgot!

82
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,290
Hey Ane-san, please forget what I said just now.

83
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,990
You think I can just do that?

84
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,370
Negi, are you going to see her?

85
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,580
Let’s go together!

86
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,130
Uh… okay!

87
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,600
See? You just made it a big deal.

88
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,500
I’m sorry…

89
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,170
Alright, let’s tell the others to come as well!

90
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,420
I wonder if it’s alright to let everyone else know…

91
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,630
Ah. That’s right…

92
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,380
I don’t think that would be a good idea…

93
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,130
Oh, I agree.

94
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,860
As expected of Negi-sensei.

95
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,060
We shouldn’t say things that may hurt people!

96
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,560
Sasaki Makie fails!

97
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,070
Eva is just fine at the moment. It’s just the situation that we are in now.

98
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,380
“Just fine”?

99
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,640
What do you mean, Chachamaru-san?

100
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,690
Don’t tell me Eva-san’s condition has worsened?

101
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,370
No, my master is feeling very well.

102
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,620
Then what’s up with the…

103
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,890
Well, how should I put this…

104
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,970
Well, the sleeping beauty grew up.

105
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,300
Oh… She grew up…

106
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,650
That’s too much!

107
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,690
Oh no she’s gonna blow!

108
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,570
Ta~mayaa!

109
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,470
We’re saved…

110
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,190
Thanks, Oneechan.

111
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,810
You’re welcome.

112
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,570
Even so…

113
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,230
What the hell just happened!?

114
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,710
It’s the darkness, it must be the effects of the darkness…

115
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,850
Ah! She’s up and moving!

116
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,140
I wonder where to?

117
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,400
Wait up a minute!

118
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,450
Are we really doing it?

119
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,580
It sounds embarrassing…

120
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,950
It’s all good! Preparations OK!

121
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,090
Should we run, Ojou-sama?

122
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,410
We’ll get chased even if we run… I’m sure of it.

123
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,930
Oh come on. Hurry up! Hurry up!

124
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,580
She’s in high spirits isn’t she, de gozaru?

125
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,230
We can’t do anything about it.

126
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,960
Let’s go, everyone.

127
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,050
Ahhh… Help us…

128
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:20,470
The lush tea and whatever yada yada and the other stuff.

129
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,230
How incoherent…

130
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:25,330
I am The Black Rose Baron!

131
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,810
Yes! Applause!

132
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,560
Ah! Thank you, thank you…

133
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,650
BLACK ROSE!

134
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,240
Everyone! There’s trouble!

135
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,990
What is it?

136
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,420
Is there a problem?

137
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,470
Err… um… well…

138
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,970
Ah, Nekane-san!

139
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:42,790
Yep!

140
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:43,540
This is…

141
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,330
Black Rose!

142
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,890
The Baron, when did another one come out!?

143
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:49,920
I don’t know…

144
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,340
No, no, that’s not it, Negi-kun.

145
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,590
This is a fake.

146
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,550
Fake?

147
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,090
There!

148
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,800
Ane-san!

149
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,510
Owwh, don’t spoil it, Konoka!

150
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,110
Don’t CALL ME A FAKE!

151
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,720
But you’re still a fake…

152
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,430
Why are you dressed like this Asuna-san?

153
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,820
Looks like she exchanged something for it.

154
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,650
Exchanged?

155
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,580
In exchange for a Chupa-Tee…

156
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,030
…she received the costume.

157
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,540
Chupa-Tee?

158
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,490
Now that you say it, Nekane, you’ve been wearing that since the morning haven’t you?

159
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,580
Huh? What’s wrong?

160
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,620
Uh… erm! Nothing!

161
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,880
In any case, Negi-bouzu. What was the trouble you were about to tell us?

162
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,110
Oh! Right!

163
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,880
Yeah! We are in a state of emergency!

164
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,840
A state of emergency?

165
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,980
This is…!?

166
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,970
She…

167
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,390
…has come.

168
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,110
It’s Eva-chan!

169
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,940
Big!!

170
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,570
Everyone! Please run!

171
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,300
You monster!

172
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,890
Alright! From here on the Black Rose Baron will…

173
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,580
Asuna-san, please stop fooling around and get out of here!

174
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,780
It’s dangerous!

175
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,090
I’m not fooling around. I’m serious!

176
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,540
BLACK ROSE!

177
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,540
Black Rose!

178
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,620
Do you want to die!?

179
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,720
Come on, quickly!

180
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,920
Huh? It’s okay if we don’t run.

181
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,050
Nekane-san, what are you saying?

182
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,050
Because it’s Eva-chan.

183
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,220
All personnel! Take cover!!

184
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,320
That was the right thing to do.

185
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,980
Asuna-san, get away, quick!

186
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,530
I can’t let her pursue you!

187
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,120
Eva-san! It’s me! Negi!

188
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,780
Negi?

189
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,150
It’s dangerous, Aniki!

190
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,000
Eva-san!

191
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,380
Negi!

192
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,390
Negi!

193
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,670
Aniki!

194
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,520
Asuna-san!

195
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,110
R…run.

196
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,230
She’s heavy so hurry up!

197
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,040
A…alright!

198
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,540
Aniki!

199
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,030
Are you alright?

200
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,830
Asuna-san! Thank you very much!

201
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,260
What you gonna do if you get squished? Stupid Negi.

202
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,360
Waaaah! I’m so s…s…sorry!

203
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,740
Can’t we do anything?

204
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,930
What can we do?

205
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,470
Chachamaru-san!

206
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,660
How about we discuss this with Takahata-sensei?

207
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,770
That’s right.

208
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,980
Takamichi, we’ve got trouble!

209
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,820
Takahata-sensei!

210
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,150
Did something happen?

211
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,590
Ah? Yeah… nothing much…

212
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,740
Ah! Don’t tell me…

213
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,700
It’s the Ramen Delicacy just now?

214
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,450
Aah… It failed, Negi-kun.

215
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,790
I’m still a long way from success, hahaha…

216
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,000
Takamichi…

217
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,340
I wonder…

218
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,670
Onee-chan!!

219
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,090
What the hell are you doing!?

220
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,050
Instinct?

221
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:33,550
Yeah. I think that Eva probably didn’t intentionally come to school, but rather by instinct.

222
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,450
Evangeline likes the school?

223
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,770
Nah. She hates it no matter what.

224
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:43,900
It doesn’t matter if she likes it or not, but it’s probably better if her body is the thing in control right now.

225
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,130
Master has been in the school for the past 15 years, that’s why.

226
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,170
15 years…

227
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,740
That’s long…

228
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,280
The Evangeline A.K. McDowell who has just become a giant…

229
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,060
Due to the many years of going to school instinctively returned to school again…

230
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,390
And, began to sleep on the roof as if she did it all the time.

231
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,010
She looks like she’s sleeping comfortably.

232
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,040
Looks like it.

233
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,400
Is that right…?

234
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,130
Won’t she return to her normal form?

235
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,420
It’s not like she did anything bad.

236
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,410
She is sleeping after all…

237
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,790
What's the matter?

238
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,630
Negi-bouzu! We have a problem-aru!

239
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,370
The building is…

240
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,950
Eva-chan’s body is too heavy!

241
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,160
This is a problem…

242
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,880
I don’t think it would be a problem the school disappears.

243
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,780
Hey, hey…

244
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,530
I think it’s okay to let it collapse.

245
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,950
Are you sure it’s alright, Ojou-sama!?

246
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,650
If you think about it, won’t that make this place dangerous, too?

247
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,900
Oh that’s true.

248
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,050
If it collapses, we’ll be affected too-aru!

249
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,080
Everything will be broken together with it!

250
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,290
Eeh!? If this place collapses that would be troublesome!

251
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,350
Negi-kun…

252
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,570
Everyone, please get together!

253
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,040
This has become a problem.

254
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,900
Everyone, please give your opinions.

255
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,300
Yep, Negi-kun!

256
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,790
Yes, Asakura-san.

257
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,070
Can’t we do anything using magic?

258
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,390
Well, my magic is a little…

259
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,130
What about Takahata-sensei?

260
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,980
He’s in bed because of a stomach ache.

261
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,280
Eh!? No way!

262
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,410
Because of that silly World Delicacy Noodles…

263
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,060
World Delicacy Noodles?

264
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,130
Satsuki, what are those noodles?

265
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,990
I don’t know about that kind of noodle.

266
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,630
Anyway, what about Nekane-san?

267
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,560
I’m sorry, Oneechan is also…

268
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,200
Also down from the World Delicacy Noodles.

269
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,570
World Delicacy Noodles you say!?

270
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:55,070
I see, that means we can’t do anything about Eva-san…

271
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,760
But, what about the World Delicacy Noodles!?

272
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,730
Yes, Mana-san?

273
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,080
Removal by force.

274
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,550
A more peaceful idea, please.

275
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,760
We might make her act violently! The school might collapse because of that!

276
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,640
But, what about the World Delicacy Noodles!?

277
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:18,930
We can ask her to come down with a “GET DOWN HERE RIGHT NOW”.

278
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,510
I don’t think she’ll be able to hear you.

279
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:24,110
Besides, that wasn’t a request. That sounded more like an order!

280
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,820
What about we find something she’s interested in?

281
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,410
Ah! That might work!

282
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,630
Let’s call the sky devil!

283
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,910
You mean the sky rock.

284
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,370
That was what I said.

285
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,370
30 Points.

286
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,390
15 Points.

287
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,950
No way, that was right.

288
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,180
Yes, Asuna-san?

289
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:48,140
Since she’s already up there, why don’t we just hang her up?

290
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,230
How do you do that up there?

291
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,220
From an empty spot I suppose.

292
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,470
You suppose?

293
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,830
Anything will do I suppose.

294
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,760
Geez, Asuna-san…

295
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,130
Natsumi, it’s your turn.

296
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,110
What?

297
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:06,810
Your bravery, I will never forget it in my lifetime. Thank you, Natsumi! Farewell…

298
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,810
I won’t do, I definitely won’t do!

299
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,030
Negi-sensei

300
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,290
Yes, Yue-san.

301
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,940
I think Nodoka has something to say.

302
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,950
Ah, yes!

303
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,400
Nodoka-san, what is it?

304
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,480
Ah yes!

305
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,290
My encyclopaedias might have the answer to this problem… I think.

306
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,960
Partner, Miyazaki Nodoka…

307
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,330
Show me the power within you!

308
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,390
Contract,

309
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,790
activate!

310
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,330
Splendid! It’s an armor-card-mya.

311
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,940
I see! If we use Nodoka-san’s encyclopaedias…

312
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,830
We might just be able to find a solution!

313
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,300
Let’s do it, Nodoka-san.

314
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,160
Alright!

315
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,840
…what should we do with a giant Evangeline-san…

316
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,680
Isn’t that a bit vague?

317
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,300
Ah! I got it!

318
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,300
Huh, really!?

319
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,760
What should we do?

320
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,380
In the meantime, we let her sleep quietly.

321
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,730
That’s too bad.

322
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,860
Life ain’t that easy.

323
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,270
It’s no use, eh?

324
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,690
Negi-sensei

325
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,610
Hakase, Chisame-san!

326
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,740
There is a way!

327
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,040
The Mechacabra version 2!

328
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,280
Chiu-chiu-san has added some power ups to it!

329
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,000
Don’t call me Chiu-chiu!

330
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,210
Why me again…

331
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,300
Anyway, what is the power up?

332
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,320
The spikes are a different colour!

333
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,590
I painted them.

334
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,290
So that’s what they call cooperation…

335
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:03,680
Anything goes. Anyway, hurry up, we’re counting on you Hakase onee-san!

336
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,060
Leave it to us!

337
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,600
Anyway, Hakase-san, how… I mean what does this Mechacabra do?

338
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,860
Stand by!

339
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:16,290
AAAAAAH! It’s moving again!

340
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,450
Launch!

341
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,510
It failed, huh.

342
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,050
Actually, that’s all it can do…

343
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,170
Eeeh… Negi-sensei!

344
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,880
Are you okay, Negi?

345
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,400
Yeah… somehow…

346
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,600
It’s already at its limit!

347
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,350
The walls are cracking up!

348
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,170
It’s useless...

349
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,160
Is that a band?

350
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,960
Chachamaru-san?

351
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,500
That song is waking her up-mya.

352
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,050
Eva is…

353
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,500
Climbing down from the building!

354
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,480
Why?

355
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,890
Alright!

356
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,610
The school is saved!

357
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,330
She’s following the sound.

358
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,330
That sounds like the Pipe of Hamelin.

359
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,940
Onee-chan! Takamichi!

360
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,350
I guess we found a solution after all.

361
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:00,760
Takahata-sensei, what do you mean by that?

362
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,040
The Heart of Japan.

363
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:08,860
In the 15 years Eva stayed in Mahora Academy, there was only one thing she liked.

364
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,810
That is the culture of the Japanese people.

365
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,050
Culture?

366
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:28,080
Inside Eva, she thinks the school is the Heart of Japan, that’s why she returned.

367
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,960
The Heart of Japan?

368
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,170
Eva-san…

369
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,480
Amazing…

370
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,010
That was such a beautiful story!

371
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:35,880
I’m moved!

372
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:51,550
And so, the school was saved from collapse by a hair’s breadth…

373
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:57,150
BUT, the magic world is beginning to change again. A storm is coming.

374
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,610
Watch it in the next episode!

375
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,320
Did anything happen today?

376
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,130
No, nothing much.

377
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,150
I feel tired somehow…

378
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,580
Sasaki Makie fails…

379
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,890
Now, we have picked out a Chamo!

380
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,210
I’m an ermine.

381
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,300
Be quiet.

382
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,970
Next time, “Takamichi, the Silent Ramen Man” by Takahata

383
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:03,290
“What the hell is that!?” By Chamo.

384
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,980
Now we put it into the hat…

385
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,520
Ahhh! Wonderful!

386
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,750
Chamo has just…

387
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,950
…gone into a bowl of Ramen!

388
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,980
Oh? Miss Ghost, eh?

389
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,670
Yeah! It’s amazing isn’t it?

390
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,170
Do you explode?

391
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,460
Well, exploding is a bit…

392
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,460
What about a big explosion?

393
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,490
Suicide bombing?
