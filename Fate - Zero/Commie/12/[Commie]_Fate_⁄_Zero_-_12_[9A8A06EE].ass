Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.08,0:07:13.04,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,there is a high probability that any unpaired Masters
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.04,0:07:15.91,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,will receive the Command Seals left behind.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.41,0:07:20.14,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,This is why Grail War participants try their best to kill,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.14,0:07:23.95,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,and not simply disable, enemy Masters.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.56,0:07:27.78,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,From that perspective, Kirei,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.78,0:07:30.50,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,is there not a good chance that the Command Seals
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.50,0:07:32.05,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,will be bestowed upon you again?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.05,0:07:33.52,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Impossible.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.52,0:07:36.08,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,If, as Tokiomi suggests,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.08,0:07:40.73,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,the Holy Grail chose me to support the Tohsaka family,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.73,0:07:43.80,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I have performed that duty.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.31,0:07:50.44,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Tokiomi already possesses a winning strategy for the remaining Masters and their Servants.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:51.67,0:08:53.84,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It appears quite different from the others.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.84,0:08:56.47,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It's the key to the storehouse in the yard.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.47,0:09:00.12,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It's old, but I've personally confirmed it is solidly built.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:00.90,0:09:06.64,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,No preparations were made, so this may be somewhat lacking as a residence.
