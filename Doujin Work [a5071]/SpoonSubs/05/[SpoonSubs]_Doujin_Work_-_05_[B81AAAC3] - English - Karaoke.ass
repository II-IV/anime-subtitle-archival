Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.06,0:03:27.61,DW,J,0000,0000,0000,,No, even if you dared me to do so.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.61,0:03:31.10,DW,J,0000,0000,0000,,Najimi is an adult and can decide everything for herself.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.10,0:03:33.93,DW,T,0000,0000,0000,,That's right.  She's a mature woman, after all.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.91,0:03:41.21,DW,J,0000,0000,0000,,B-But then again, whether to ask or whether to play dumb, that's the problem.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.21,0:03:43.73,DW,T,0000,0000,0000,,I guess you're an adult who can't decide anything for himself.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.45,0:03:48.16,DW,J,0000,0000,0000,,But wouldn't I be disrespecting her, violating her privacy like that?

Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.12,0:04:15.41,DW,J,0000,0000,0000,,I just thought it'd be more fun to do it together.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.41,0:04:17.94,DW,T,0000,0000,0000,,That's right, two people doing it together is more fun than doing it alone, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.79,0:04:19.40,DW,N,0000,0000,0000,,Hey!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.40,0:04:22.90,DW,T,0000,0000,0000,,Though when three people do it, it starts to get a little abnormal.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.90,0:04:25.73,DW,J,0000,0000,0000,,I wonder, could you be quiet for a bit?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.10,0:04:27.29,DW,S,0000,0000,0000,,What are you talking about?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.82,0:04:29.79,DW,T,0000,0000,0000,,It's too soon for kids like you to know.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.67,0:04:36.21,DW,T,0000,0000,0000,,Ask her.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.54,0:04:38.16,DW,N,0000,0000,0000,,Huh? What is it?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.55,0:04:40.76,DW,J,0000,0000,0000,,Ah-I-Uh...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.76,0:04:42.88,DW,J,0000,0000,0000,,What should I...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.89,0:04:46.72,DW,J,0000,0000,0000,,That panel, it'd be better if you showed more of it.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.72,0:04:48.76,DW,N,0000,0000,0000,,Ah, thank you!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.16,0:04:53.97,DW,T,0000,0000,0000,,Huh, so they're going to a hotel in this scene?

Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.29,0:05:18.80,DW,J,0000,0000,0000,,That Hoshi guy, acting so improperly towards Najimi.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.80,0:05:22.17,DW,J,0000,0000,0000,,I need to beat some sense into him, somehow!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.18,0:05:23.96,DW,J,0000,0000,0000,,That's it! Manga!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.69,0:05:26.74,DW,J,0000,0000,0000,,Manga will make him see!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.74,0:05:31.07,DW,J,0000,0000,0000,,Right, the theme will be the sinfulness of promiscuity, the greatness of pure love.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.07,0:05:34.67,DW,J,0000,0000,0000,,The story of the fall and rehabilitation of a young man steeped in sin.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.67,0:05:40.78,DW,J,0000,0000,0000,,Under these circumstances, I'll draw as much as needed no matter how many hundreds of pages it takes!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.52,0:05:49.13,DW,T,0000,0000,0000,,Well, what was the real place like?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.78,0:05:52.69,DW,N,0000,0000,0000,,Though there's a hotel in this scene, 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.69,0:05:56.78,DW,N,0000,0000,0000,,I've never been to one so I didn't know what they were like.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.78,0:05:59.57,DW,N,0000,0000,0000,,So the picture gave off a hospital-ish vibe.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.57,0:06:02.62,DW,T,0000,0000,0000,,So the two of you went to do some research.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.24,0:06:04.66,DW,S,0000,0000,0000,,A hotel?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.66,0:06:06.68,DW,S,0000,0000,0000,,Did you take a trip somewhere?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.68,0:06:09.08,DW,N,0000,0000,0000,,See, they wouldn't let me in alone.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.74,0:06:11.95,DW,S,0000,0000,0000,,Why, why?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.95,0:06:14.06,DW,T,0000,0000,0000,,So you tried going by yourself as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.06,0:06:18.57,DW,N,0000,0000,0000,,Besides, inviting Justice to come with me felt like a bother.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.57,0:06:22.01,DW,N,0000,0000,0000,,I mean, it felt like he really misunderstood before.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.44,0:06:25.06,DW,T,0000,0000,0000,,Actually, he's still under the wrong impression now.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.06,0:06:27.27,DW,T,0000,0000,0000,,Still, I'm a little suspicious of Hoshi-kun.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.66,0:06:28.94,DW,N,0000,0000,0000,,It's fine!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.94,0:06:31.93,DW,N,0000,0000,0000,,I'll say this ahead of time, there's nothing like that going on.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.93,0:06:33.44,DW,N,0000,0000,0000,,I'll swear on it, even.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.44,0:06:34.48,DW,T,0000,0000,0000,,Got it.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.48,0:06:38.91,DW,T,0000,0000,0000,,After all, it's unimaginable that you would do something like that, Najimi.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.79,0:06:41.47,DW,S,0000,0000,0000,,Anything like what?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.47,0:06:44.25,DW,T,0000,0000,0000,,Well, go on and show me the fruits of your research.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.25,0:06:46.81,DW,T,0000,0000,0000,,After all, there's not long to go before the event.
