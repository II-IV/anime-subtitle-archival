1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,430
So Tsuyuri, what were
you doing yesterday?

2
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,430
I went to Seibu-Chichibu.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,470
Really? Is there
something at Seibu-Chichibu?

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,200
I wonder what was there...

5
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,520
Chance to get up!

6
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,120
Just decide.

7
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,550
Chance to get dream!

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,220
Just decide.

9
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,460
Pushing?

10
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,730
Pulling?

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,290
Strategy! What to do?

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,910
Oh, what a night! (It won't get done.)
It won't stop.

13
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,980
Dream and delusion rampage battle!

14
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,450
The dazzling world.

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,950
That's a life encounter.

16
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,680
I can't? But I want to see.

17
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,920
But more and more
heart throbbing, heart throbbing...

18
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:08,020
...heart throbbing, heart throbbing
is what you get, right?

19
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,230
Why not! Why not! Why not! Why not!

20
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,770
Friendship that'll last a lifetime!

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,970
It's not like a hero,
but you feel something.

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,740
You, me, who? This, that?
Him, anyone's okay!

23
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,140
Anywhere it is!

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:33,280
If you're with everyone, it's the best!

25
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,360
Chance to get up!

26
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,090
Just decide.

27
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,690
Chance to get dream!

28
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,290
Just decide.

29
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,990
Dojin Work

30
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,870
I went to Najimi's job yesterday
and had her draw for me.

31
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,440
Really.

32
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,170
She was a little better at it.

33
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,740
Maybe it's because of the training.

34
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,310
Tsuyurin, did you go
somewhere yesterday?

35
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,950
Seibu-Chichibu.

36
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,090
I'm going to play with Justice
at the park today at sundown.

37
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,760
Would you like to join us, Tsuyurin?

38
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,990
I am going to shop at Akihabara.

39
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,230
I don't have time to be
playing with a child after that.

40
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,570
7th Edition
How wonderful the smell of BaLa.

41
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,020
Never thought I would
run into you here...

42
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,260
Nido-san, you're shopping also?

43
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,300
Erotic game...

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,100
I...

45
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,200
But, it's not that I really like
erotic games or anything...

46
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,540
More like... I've never experienced it,
so for the purpose of studying...

47
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,240
With the way you just said it,
it's as if you're coming out...

48
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,910
...with a loud voice saying you've
never experienced anything sexually.

49
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,920
No!

50
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,350
It's not like that...

51
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,490
Well, I've never done it before, but...

52
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,860
...of course I know
what kind of things you do.

53
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,360
Nido-san, why don't we do something
that feels a lot better than erotic games?

54
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,430
What?

55
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,200
What! You're going to
become Nido-san's second?

56
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,340
Wait a second, Tsuyuri!

57
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,580
Whose side are you on!

58
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,280
I'm enemies of you both?

59
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,820
What are you saying!

60
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,940
Tsuyuri!

61
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,880
She hung up on me.

62
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,360
This has gotten bad...

63
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,220
Nido-san's second, huh?

64
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,130
Be cautious of the
shape and direction!

65
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,760
What am I to do?

66
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,370
More gentle!

67
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,870
But I will definitely not lose to them!

68
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,000
That's right!

69
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,800
That's a wonderful boobie!

70
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,570
More like what kind of second are you!

71
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,580
What! A perverted manga?

72
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,040
I am?

73
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,610
It's fine.

74
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,850
Basically, an erotic one sells better.

75
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,050
For the meantime,
let's try writing one.

76
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,090
I'm erotic too,
so I can give you advice.

77
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,100
Then I would be able to
sell more than Najimi-san?

78
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,600
Easily.

79
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,400
Let's twist her easily.

80
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,830
Let's do it.

81
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,340
Let's make a really erotic one.

82
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,910
Yes, a really erotic one.

83
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,370
An obscene one...

84
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,500
An obscene one...

85
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,740
Immorality...

86
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,340
Immorality...

87
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,750
Hello?

88
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,030
You're Najimi-san's friend...

89
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,890
Why do you have my number?

90
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,890
I got it from Najimi.

91
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh, is that so?

92
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,930
So is there something?

93
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,300
I would like to ask you
to help Najimi's rival.

94
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,900
What do you mean?

95
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,710
There is a girl that is competing
on the sales of her dojinshi, but...

96
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,910
...I wanted you to help her so
her ability to draw will get better.

97
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,610
What! N-No, I can't!

98
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,380
That would mean
I'm betraying Najimi-san!

99
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,660
No, it's more for Najimi.

100
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,050
Huh?

101
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,060
People finally grow for the first time
after passing through a trial.

102
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,200
Remember, for their child's own good...

103
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,830
...lions make them come pick them
up at Shibuya station, you know?

104
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,130
I have a feeling you've
mixed it up with the dog story...

105
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,540
I get it!

106
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,040
I purposely give her a trial
and make Najimi-san grow!

107
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,180
Depending on your effort,
you'll be able to receive something big.

108
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,350
S-Something big?

109
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,320
Najimi's heart.

110
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,920
I'll do it!

111
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,720
What do I have to do?

112
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,220
I want you to carefully
select a couple of copies of...

113
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,030
...18+ dojinshi that are for
the female audience and buy them.

114
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,370
18+ dojinshi for the female audience?

115
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,540
With your sense.

116
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,940
Then I will meet you at the
Nerima Station entrance in two hours.

117
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:20,800
What?

118
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,230
Ah, hold on!

119
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,870
This is Hoshi-kun.

120
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,110
This is Kaneru Nido-san.

121
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,370
Hello...

122
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,240
You're Najimi-san's rival.

123
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,480
Yes...

124
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,350
So, in regards to
creating an erotic manga...

125
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,590
Hoshi-kun, the books please.

126
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,590
Um, here.

127
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,660
What?

128
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,430
I thought if you're going to draw it,
it'd be for the female audience, so...

129
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,160
...I had him go choose some.

130
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,770
That's his choice.

131
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,930
R-Really...

132
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,440
There are those that exist, huh?

133
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,510
What!

134
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,310
I'm going to be drawing like this?

135
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,780
It's reference for that.

136
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,520
What do you think?

137
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,830
Well, if they like that kind of stuff,
I think they are free to draw it.

138
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,060
I understand.

139
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,160
They are free to like whatever they want.

140
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,830
Hoshi-san, when you
say it, it's convincing!

141
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,760
Is that so.

142
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,740
Oh, I'll make some tea.

143
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,470
No, I'll do it!

144
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,340
You have to practice
your drawing, right?

145
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,180
Yes.

146
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,370
Then I'll take you up on the offer.

147
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,590
He definitely has a feminine side,
like he really pays attention to detail.

148
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,590
He has those kinds of traits.

149
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,820
That's true. That's why
Justice doesn't leave him alone.

150
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,090
What!

151
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,650
Justice-san too?

152
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,820
Speaking of...

153
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,300
Excuse me!

154
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,170
Excuse me!
Y-Yes?

155
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,330
Hoshi-san, by any chance
do you have someone you like...

156
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,840
...and could that be
someone that I know?

157
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,340
What! W-Why do you know that?

158
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,110
Are you guys dating?

159
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,170
No, but hopefully by some chance...

160
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,240
What about Sora-chan?

161
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,010
Doesn't Sora-chan know about this?

162
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,220
What?

163
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,690
Oh, her?

164
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,020
I don't think she knows.

165
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,020
It's not "I don't think she knows"!

166
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,260
What!

167
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,890
What a hurtful dream!

168
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,830
What?

169
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,130
Um, Nido-san...

170
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,560
Let's go!

171
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,260
Huh?

172
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,760
You are going to
confess your love! Now!

173
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,060
Right now?

174
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,500
If it's right now,
I think they're at the park.

175
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,770
All of a sudden?

176
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,770
For girls, hearing the truth later
than it's supposed to be is worse!

177
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,600
Is that so?

178
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,940
She's been waiting for my words!

179
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,980
I understand!

180
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,350
I'm a man too.

181
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,680
Let's go!

182
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,290
I'm sorry, Sora-chan...

183
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,900
...for hurting your cute dream.

184
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,300
Also, I'm sorry about another thing.

185
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,510
The truth is, just a little...

186
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:11,100
...really, just a little bit,
I want to see those two as a couple.

187
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,450
Taste of honey...

188
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,320
Sora-chan.

189
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,320
Kaneru-chan?

190
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,560
Is this fine?

191
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,600
Yes...

192
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,360
Oh, make the ribbon...

193
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,070
...yellow, please!

194
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,100
What?

195
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:43,080
Hoshi-san is going to confess
his love to Justice right now!

196
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,070
Why?

197
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,640
There are men like that in this world!

198
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,410
That's Hoshi-san!

199
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,120
I don't understand.

200
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,280
I'm sorry!

201
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,150
Justice!

202
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:54,980
What?

203
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,610
Right now, Hoshi-san!

204
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,460
I have to talk to you!

205
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,630
What? Why?

206
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,860
Look at how they're
staring at each other.

207
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,130
What's there to talk about?

208
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,000
Please hurry up.

209
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,660
I have a commitment with Sora.

210
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,470
No, um...

211
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,940
What the heck is that!

212
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,640
Wait a second...

213
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,910
Does that mean I should take care of
the situation with the biggest obstacle...

214
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:28,080
...which is this man before
I confess my love to Najimi-san?

215
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,320
Here it goes!

216
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,890
Listen well, Justice!

217
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,180
What I have to talk to you about
is nothing out of the ordinary!

218
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,060
It's about Najimi-san and I!

219
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,060
Why don't I listen?

220
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,290
No, um...

221
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,700
I want to become closer
with Najimi-san, so...

222
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,460
Could you please
warmly look over us.

223
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,940
No! I can't let you
get closer to Najimi!

224
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,370
What are you trying to say I did!

225
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,970
I haven't done anything
that Najimi-san wouldn't like!

226
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,810
Even the time we went to
research the hotel together!

227
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,880
I was thinking maybe
if we got into a good situation...

228
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,860
But in the end it didn't become
any good situation anyway!

229
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,190
Good boys and girls...

230
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,000
It's now 5:30PM.

231
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,630
What do you mean by that?

232
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,070
Um, well...

233
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,270
That's...

234
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,770
Justice-san made the move first.

235
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,780
No way...

236
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,780
I would like to listen
to that in more detail.

237
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,280
What!

238
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,010
You're taking his lips forcefully?

239
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,050
No! You can't do such a thing!

240
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,280
Wait!

241
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,830
Wait!

242
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,460
Justice!

243
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,240
This is another way
love takes shape?

244
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,970
I'm going to make
this my piece's base.

245
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,340
With both of their agreement!

246
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,470
Definitely!

247
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,460
Mysterious.

248
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,000
Before one knows...

249
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:26,800
If you take your first step...

250
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,940
Completely, totally unexpectedly...

251
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,880
...you start liking things
that you don't like.

252
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,380
My true self wakes up?

253
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,820
Mu, fu, fu, maybe it's a charm.

254
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,990
Run through life in one line.

255
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:55,100
The sky is pink.

256
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,130
Bloomers just fly by.

257
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,070
Area of no experience.

258
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,700
Let's move on!

259
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,640
Happy smiling!

260
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,540
The dreaming maiden is sui sui chao!

261
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,350
Even the steep places breaststroke.

262
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:19,850
Let tomorrow be
the polka-dot pattern.

263
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,500
So let's do our best!

264
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,900
Has there ever been an
anime this perverted before?

265
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,670
What? There is?

266
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,240
8th Edition, You can see everything!

267
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,970
8th Edition, You can see everything!
Please let me borrow that DVD.
