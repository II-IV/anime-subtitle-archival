1
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,600
We came to the ocean
for a summer training camp.

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,960
At night, baths,
fireworks, and pillow fights!

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,070
A lot of fun things!

4
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:17,440
Right, Najimi-san?

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,810
There's no time!

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,710
The sales exhibition is in two days!

7
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,520
Chance to get up!

8
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,120
Just decide.

9
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,560
Chance to get dream!

10
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,230
Just decide.

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,470
Pushing?

12
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,730
Pulling?

13
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,300
Strategy! What to do?

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,910
Oh, what a night! (It won't get done.)
It won't stop.

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,980
Dream and delusion rampage battle!

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,450
The dazzling world.

17
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,950
That's a life encounter.

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,680
I can't? But I want to see.

19
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,920
But more and more
heart throbbing, heart throbbing...

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,020
...heart throbbing, heart throbbing
is what you get, right?

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,230
Why not! Why not! Why not! Why not!

22
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,770
Friendship that'll last a lifetime!

23
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,970
It's not like a hero,
but you feel something.

24
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:29,740
You, me, who? This, that?
Him, anyone's okay!

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,150
Anywhere it is!

26
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:38,280
If you're with everyone, it's the best!

27
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,360
Chance to get up!

28
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,090
Just decide.

29
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,700
Chance to get dream!

30
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,290
Just decide.

31
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,000
Dojin Work

32
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,840
Trains are good once in a while.

33
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,620
You can tell what
society is interested in.

34
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,120
They're the fresh voices that you
can't hear through number data.

35
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,730
Boys, you want to know the
continuation of that manga right now, right?

36
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,300
The manuscript of
next month's issue is...

37
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,890
...inside this editor's bag
which belongs to me.

38
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,330
It's gone!

39
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,740
Why...

40
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,900
Why isn't the manuscript here?

41
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,570
Don't scratch the car.

42
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,040
I know.

43
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,510
You didn't forget anything?

44
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,470
Nope.

45
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,750
All right, Brother, I'm off!

46
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,450
Inside the car!

47
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,260
I was the one that forgot something!

48
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,230
10th Edition
This is what it's come to.

49
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,960
So, yeah...

50
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,630
With all that, I came
chasing after it all the way here.

51
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,610
Really...

52
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,630
Brother, you work at a publisher?

53
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,100
Hey!

54
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,480
Ah, you didn't know?

55
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,210
I thought you were a male escort...

56
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,480
I mean, your hair is so weird...

57
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,480
Hey, regardless of how
you see it, it's cool, right?

58
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,420
By the way, where are
Najimi and Nido-san?

59
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,220
I got them to walk
and go grocery shopping.

60
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,420
This late with just two girls...

61
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,230
I'm worried...

62
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,730
Najimi-san!

63
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,430
Look! A big fish!

64
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,100
We're not buying that! Put it back!

65
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,480
You'll save money with this rice!

66
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,710
We don't need 10 kg right now!

67
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,850
Then, just the badminton set!

68
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,890
No!

69
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,990
Folk art section
Najimi-san! Souvenirs!

70
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,090
No, listen to me...

71
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,530
Hey, where did you come from?

72
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,870
You really saved us!

73
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,370
It's all right, we were bored anyway.

74
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,640
Are you guys like that?

75
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,200
Buddy-buddy sister type?

76
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,040
Does it seem that way?

77
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,810
What?

78
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,210
Yeah, the t-shirts
are totally the same too.

79
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,770
Damn it!

80
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,550
I was the one that chose them!

81
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,260
Did you come here to swim?

82
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,490
Um...

83
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,660
Right! We came to train.

84
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,820
Training?

85
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,630
Riding the waves or something?

86
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,230
No, um...

87
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,900
It's drawing training!

88
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,970
Ah, like art students?

89
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,170
W-Well, it's different, but...

90
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,140
Drawing male bodies is really hard.

91
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,350
Hey!

92
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,980
Really? You draw stuff like that too?

93
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,680
You want us to be your models?

94
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,660
No, um...

95
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,680
No, um...
Please!

96
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,690
W-What!

97
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,890
T-This is kind of disgusting...

98
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,730
I-I can't help it! I don't want to either.

99
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,500
Could you bring your face closer?

100
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,090
I want to go home...

101
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,660
L-Like this?

102
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,830
More!

103
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,500
I can't do this anymore!

104
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,400
Don't breathe on me!

105
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,460
Don't move!

106
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,840
No!

107
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,550
What kind of drawing is this anyway?

108
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,580
The beautiful shape of love!

109
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,820
Beautiful?

110
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,590
Shape of love?

111
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,280
More than that...

112
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,330
Let's make the normal
shape of love instead...

113
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,590
What is going to happen to us?

114
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,020
A ghostly flame?

115
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,670
It's coming closer.

116
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,500
Huh?

117
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,040
A ghostly flame in this day and age?

118
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,040
Right?

119
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,800
You're kidding, right?

120
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,670
There's no way...

121
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,510
W-What is it?

122
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,020
It's a person.

123
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,220
Justice.

124
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,650
Justice-san...

125
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,450
I'm sorry my companions
have troubled you.

126
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,690
Who the hell are you?

127
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,560
They are having fun with us!

128
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,360
Having fun...

129
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,190
Really?

130
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,890
Then why don't I...

131
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,870
...get you guys to mix me in too!

132
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,440
I-It's appeared!

133
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,250
By the way, the writer
that you have your eyes on...

134
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,810
...what kind of person was he?

135
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,440
Najimi-san is making
a really good book.

136
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,720
Wait a second!

137
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,780
Najimi-san?

138
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,260
It's a girl. So it was a girl!

139
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,230
Okay!

140
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,990
Okay, continue.

141
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,760
First off, read this.

142
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,490
Ah, it's Najimi's book.

143
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,060
This is good paper...

144
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,660
How is it, Brother!

145
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,070
No, this is horrible...

146
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,730
No it isn't!

147
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,870
Brother, you don't understand the
feelings that were put into this book!

148
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,040
More than the feelings
that were put into it...

149
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,680
...it's just the feelings you
have for the girl that drew this.

150
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,420
You hit the nail on the head.

151
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,850
It's not like that!

152
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,820
Brother, you just don't understand!

153
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,150
Forget it, just leave!

154
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,890
This is me and Sora's room.

155
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,160
Brother, you blockhead!

156
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,560
I'll just leave!

157
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,330
Ah, that's...

158
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,300
...a closet...

159
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:30,070
But I should try not to follow guys
that I don't know from now on.

160
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,940
Somehow, I finished the
story and the frame work!

161
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,710
I need to thank Justice-san.

162
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,220
So, want to go to bed soon?

163
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,420
Let's do that.

164
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,020
It's like a school trip.

165
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,060
Hey, let's have a pillow fight!

166
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,700
No...

167
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,330
W-What? It's fun though...

168
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:05,770
Okay!

169
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,750
How is it? Tell me the bad parts!

170
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,940
Everything.

171
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,040
Specifically...

172
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,420
All the drawings.

173
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,850
Please tell me the bad parts!

174
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,250
First of all, as an adult...

175
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:19,890
What?

176
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,660
I think it's the drawings!

177
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,890
Okay, I'll do my best!

178
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:04,960
It's done!

179
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,070
It's finally done.

180
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,110
Congratulations!

181
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,180
Well, it's on copy paper,
but somehow it's done.

182
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,870
It's amazing, Najimi-san!

183
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:13,850
I was moved!

184
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,770
Yeah, seriously!

185
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,680
What? You're still here?

186
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,620
I moved my luggage.
I'm about to leave.

187
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,720
But it was seriously a good harvest.

188
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,450
I think I understood your
meaning a little more.

189
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,420
Ah, my book?

190
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,230
More like, who's he?

191
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,230
We didn't introduce him.

192
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,870
He's Hoshi-kun's older brother.

193
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,960
Really...

194
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,270
Nice to meet you. I'm Najimi Osana.

195
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,970
Ah, yeah, yeah...

196
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,700
She held my hand!

197
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,480
Ah, hello, thank you for taking
care of my brother all the time.

198
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,040
No, he's been taking
care of me more.

199
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,820
Sorry to keep you waiting!

200
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,220
Okay, so now both
of them are together.

201
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,790
Brother, what's up?

202
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,830
That girl named Najimi,
she's coming on to me.

203
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,150
What?

204
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:07,460
Well, I just met her,
and she went to hold my hand.

205
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,970
What am I to do?

206
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,400
If you say that, when I
met her for the first time...

207
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,300
...she intensely hugged me!

208
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,170
W-What...

209
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,910
She definitely likes me more!

210
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,240
What a loose girl...

211
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,240
Najimi-san isn't that kind of person!

212
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,710
I'm going to put mine on this side.

213
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,750
What? Yeah...

214
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,820
Oh, little brother!

215
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,750
Brother!

216
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,120
Hold off...

217
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,520
Nido-san?

218
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,060
Yes?

219
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,360
Nose bleed...

220
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,960
No, this isn't!

221
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,690
It's the sweat of my heart!

222
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,560
Now I'm going to sell away!

223
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,960
Me too!

224
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,000
Huh?

225
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,650
Things like this happen, huh?

226
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,520
I thought it would turn out this way.

227
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,520
But with this, everything
you did went to waste.

228
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,360
Well, but it wasn't all a waste.

229
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,920
It was the first time
I drew that intently.

230
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,030
Right?

231
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,030
Excuse me...

232
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,000
How much is this?

233
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,540
It's 100 yen!

234
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,880
Here.

235
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,240
T-Thank you very much.

236
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,020
There was something
like this for 100 yen?

237
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,420
Really?

238
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,480
Dude, it's bad!

239
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,080
Can I get a copy too?

240
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,020
Yes!

241
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,790
Can I get a copy of that one?

242
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,720
Ah, yes!

243
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,250
Please line up single file.

244
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,720
Can I get you anything to drink?

245
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,990
The emotions are conveyed, huh?

246
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,130
Should I head home now?

247
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,470
No! The manuscript!

248
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,180
A breathtaking manuscript.

249
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,490
Mysterious.

250
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,040
Before one knows...

251
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,840
If you take your first step...

252
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:30,970
Completely, totally unexpectedly...

253
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,910
...you start liking things
that you don't like.

254
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:39,420
My true self wakes up?

255
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,850
Mu, fu, fu, maybe it's a charm.

256
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,020
Run through life in one line.

257
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,130
The sky is pink.

258
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:59,160
Bloomers just fly by.

259
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,100
Area of no experience.

260
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,730
Let's move on!

261
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,680
Happy smiling!

262
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,570
The dreaming maiden is sui sui chao!

263
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,380
Even the steep places breaststroke.

264
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,890
Let tomorrow be
the polka-dot pattern.

265
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,530
So let's do our best!

266
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,240
Here, it's the final leg of the race.

267
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,270
Let Najimi hear your cheering.

268
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:40,040
11th Edition, Najimi's going to fly.
Let me hear your idiosyncrasies.
