1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,190
Dojinshi exhibition and sale event...

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,970
It's mostly where individuals
buy and sell their books.

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,730
The participants work hard
every day for each of their purposes.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,980
If there is someone
that realizes their dream...

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,380
...there are also those
that are thrown into reality.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,080
This is the story of those that
live in that type of dojin world.

7
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,530
Chance to get up!

8
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,130
Just decide.

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,560
Chance to get dream!

10
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,230
Just decide.

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,470
Pushing?

12
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,740
Pulling?

13
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,300
Strategy! What to do?

14
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,920
Oh, what a night! (It won't get done.)
It won't stop.

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,990
Dream and delusion rampage battle!

16
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,450
The dazzling world.

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,960
That's a life encounter.

18
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,690
I can't? But I want to see.

19
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,930
But more and more
heart throbbing, heart throbbing...

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,030
...heart throbbing, heart throbbing
is what you get, right?

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,240
Why not! Why not! Why not! Why not!

22
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,780
Friendship that'll last a lifetime!

23
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:29,980
It's not like a hero,
but you feel something.

24
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,750
You, me, who? This, that?
Him, anyone's okay!

25
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,150
Anywhere it is!

26
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:42,290
If you're with everyone, it's the best!

27
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,370
Chance to get up!

28
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,100
Just decide.

29
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,700
Chance to get dream!

30
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,300
Just decide.

31
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,000
Dojin Work

32
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,050
So as for me, I was reflecting on it...

33
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,060
...and taking in my manager's lecture
with my body and soul, but...

34
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:13,260
...one of my bangs was slightly
touching the tip of my nose.

35
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,620
It was really itchy!

36
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,260
So my manager
saw that face and said...

37
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,630
..."What's with that face! Do you have
some kind of complaint or something?"

38
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,360
So then I didn't think
and accidentally said...

39
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,740
..."I'm sorry the hair was..."

40
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,240
I totally forgot, but...

41
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,980
...there was some suspicion
that my manager had a toupee.

42
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,780
Of course I was fired.

43
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,540
Man, I was planning on
buying a bicycle too.

44
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,590
Tsuyuri?

45
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,690
Sorry. I was asleep.

46
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,260
What, you weren't listening to
any of that story just now?

47
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,030
I was listening.

48
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,670
After that, Najimi, you went
into the pool naked and...

49
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,500
Where did that story come from?

50
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,240
You haven't been listening!

51
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,740
More like, Tsuyuri, you have
been looking really sleepy recently.

52
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,510
Yeah, I didn't sleep last night either.

53
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,180
An all-nighter?

54
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,710
What were you doing?

55
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,710
The truth is...

56
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,050
Oh, is it something perverted?

57
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,950
How did you know?

58
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,960
It is definitely pretty perverted.

59
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,990
What, are you serious?

60
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,830
Really? An all-nighter...

61
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,700
When did you find a person
to do those kinds of things with?

62
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,240
What? I'm doing it alone...

63
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,600
Doing it alone?

64
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,400
To the point that you're losing sleep?

65
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,310
A-An all-nighter?

66
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,520
If you have interest,
you want to help me?

67
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,880
Help you?

68
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,510
Next station, Yurigaoka.
Next is Yurigaoka.

69
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,150
It's not yuri!

70
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,480
Please excuse me.

71
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,290
Next station is Ouizumi Academy.

72
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,190
Well, Tsuyuri...

73
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,030
I like you as a friend, but...

74
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,500
...I can't imagine a relationship
more than that...

75
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,660
This is Ouizumi Academy.

76
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,240
I'll see you...

77
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,940
I'll see you...
I'll pay you.

78
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,670
I'll pay you.

79
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,180
Hey, you shouldn't be doing such things!

80
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,410
How much do you want?

81
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,510
It's not that type of problem!

82
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,820
What about 20,000 yen?

83
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,950
The train is departing.

84
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:24,960
First Edition

85
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,760
First Edition
My First XXX

86
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,630
What a horrible face.

87
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,920
I couldn't sleep last night.

88
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,200
What were you doing
pulling an all-nighter?

89
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,600
Leave me alone.

90
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,010
Well, I'll ask again, but dojinshi?

91
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:40,940
Yes.

92
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,910
Aren't those manga that you draw
on your own using manga characters?

93
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,240
That's what it mostly is.

94
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,610
By the way, there are a lot of people
that draw perverted manga.

95
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,010
I'm mainly into sexual assault.

96
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,020
Sexual?

97
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,250
Then by perverted stuff and
being sleep-deprived, you meant...

98
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,450
Of course I was working on my manga.

99
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,860
What about the part-time job?

100
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,120
I wanted you to be a salesgirl for me.

101
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,830
More like, what did you think it was?

102
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,230
You came this far...

103
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,800
Father, Mother...

104
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,170
I am still okay.

105
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,470
You do not have enough funds.

106
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,440
Please pay the sufficient
amount at the window.

107
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,010
Are you okay?

108
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,190
This is the club's space.

109
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,350
Club?

110
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,530
That's what a group
of people that do dojin are called.

111
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,030
There are a lot of clubs that
are run by individuals. Like me.

112
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,330
Really?

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,990
Does your club have
a name or something?

114
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,360
Panty Revolution.

115
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:46,370
What?

116
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,770
Panty Revolution.

117
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,740
Sorry. It's not going into my head at all.

118
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,680
Let me hear it one more time.

119
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,910
Let me hear it one more time.
Panty Revolution.

120
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,650
Panty Revo...

121
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,280
Panty Revo...
Don't worry about it anymore. I got it.

122
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,780
Comic Festival has now begun!

123
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,020
Najimi, hurry and put the books out.

124
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,030
Yeah...

125
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,290
Enforcement Bloomers

126
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,000
New book

127
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,670
I'm leaving for a little...

128
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,100
Huh, where are you going?

129
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,230
Restroom.

130
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,000
Me too.

131
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,340
No. Najimi, you're watching the table.

132
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,980
That was the reason
why I asked you to help.

133
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,040
When I come back, we'll switch.

134
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,150
See you.

135
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,480
Hey, wait a second!

136
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,310
Sample - New

137
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,060
Excuse me...

138
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,450
This new book...

139
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,630
Can I look at it?

140
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,390
Huh?

141
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,620
Ah, yes, go ahead...

142
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,570
This...

143
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,300
No, it's not...

144
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,130
Uh, how much is this?

145
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,740
Um...

146
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,150
About how much do they run around?

147
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,510
Oh, nothing! Then...

148
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:07,660
Two...

149
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,150
Two...
It's 500 yen.

150
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:11,190
There you go.

151
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,720
There you go.
Thank you very much!

152
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,960
You're happy when your book sells, huh?

153
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,860
Yes, very much.

154
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,930
It's calmed down a little.

155
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,800
You helped a lot. Thank you.

156
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,940
No problem. When I think I could get
a bicycle because of this, then...

157
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,970
Oh yeah, I have a question, but are
you able to make money with dojinshi?

158
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,350
When you become a major company,
you sell copies in the thousands, so...

159
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,050
...I hear there are places
that make about 10,000,000.

160
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,220
10,000,000?

161
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,460
I want to work hard
and be able to sell more.

162
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,790
T-Tsuyuri, about
how much is your profit?

163
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:58,130
300 copies sold out, and if
I subtract everything, about 50,000 yen.

164
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,870
I think it's going to end up
about that much today too.

165
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,240
What?

166
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,710
If Tsuyuri pays me for helping her out,
her profit's going to be...

167
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,080
This is a nice book.

168
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,550
One copy, please.

169
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,190
Thank you very much.

170
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,950
Also, may I have you that
looks great with a beret on?

171
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,290
Will it be carry-out then?

172
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:20,950
What?

173
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,960
I will be dining here.

174
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,990
Well, whichever way, the answer is no...

175
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,960
You are more lovely
for not falling the ordinary way.

176
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,470
What's the matter, Sora?

177
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,580
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just kidding.

178
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,580
Justice.

179
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,880
Sora.

180
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,620
Justice? Then you're...

181
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,720
Oh, Najimi, it's you.

182
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:54,900
What a coincidence.

183
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,360
What do you mean, coincidence?

184
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,630
Justice, who is she?

185
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,870
Najimi. She's my childhood friend, Sora.

186
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,630
More like, what are you doing here?

187
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,870
Justice? Are you possibly
from the major company club?

188
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,640
You know of me?

189
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,880
I'm honored.

190
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,610
What, major company?

191
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,380
You're not participating
with the club today?

192
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,880
I am doing my own shopping right now.

193
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,620
Hold on, Tsuyuri.

194
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,620
You said if you're in a major company, there
are places that sell copies in the 10,000s, right?

195
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,450
Yes.

196
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,120
Justice, what about you?

197
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,230
This time around the
3 new books all sold out, so...

198
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,120
In total, 30,000 copies.

199
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,000
If it's 1 book at 1,000 yen,
you could buy an apartment building.

200
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,170
We're distributing at 100 yen, though.

201
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,370
But that's still 3,000,000 yen!

202
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,500
The printing cost is 2,900,000 yen.

203
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,710
Then with the miscellaneous expenses,
pretty much nothing is left with me.

204
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,140
What do you mean by that?

205
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:56,650
But, I'm satisfied if the readers are happy.

206
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,660
I don't need the money.

207
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,890
Justice, you are so cool!

208
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,390
Thank you.

209
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,000
Stop spurring on your success...

210
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,700
But that is amazing.

211
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:12,230
If I work hard on it,
getting rich quick isn't a dream, right?

212
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,770
To think there was big business
in a place like this!

213
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,610
Dojinshi and its tremendous power!

214
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,470
Najimi?

215
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,040
If this business goes well...

216
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,110
That's right, if it goes well...

217
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,880
...I can eat my fill of really good food!

218
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:28,660
No!

219
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,020
Why am I talking about something
on such a small scale like food!

220
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,430
No, it's not that! If this goes well...

221
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,160
...I can get dessert with it too!

222
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,200
Hey, hey, could you buy this too?

223
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,100
Hey, hey, could you buy this too?
Sketch book

224
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:42,700
That's right.

225
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,830
First of all, is dojinshi something
that you can write all of a sudden?

226
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,600
I've never drawn outside
of a class in school, have I?

227
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,070
Senpai's Through Pass

228
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,590
Senpai's Through Pass

229
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,090
You drew this, right?

230
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,190
Ah, yes.

231
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,600
It's possible.

232
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,190
What?

233
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,130
Thanks to you, an infinite chance
of opportunity has opened for me!

234
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,210
Th-Then you'll buy one from me?

235
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,370
No.

236
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,540
What's the matter?

237
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,850
You will only be able
to laugh right now!

238
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,410
No, the one that's
laughing is you, Najimi.

239
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,120
I, Najimi Osana, declare right here!

240
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,490
I'm going to make
a lot of profit with dojin!

241
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,490
I can see it! I can see it!

242
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,000
My future!

243
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,270
It's dangerous, so please get down!

244
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,010
Dojin Work
It's starting! It's starting!

245
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,500
Dojin Work

246
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,030
Mysterious.

247
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,570
Before one knows...

248
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,370
If you take your first step...

249
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,500
Completely, totally unexpectedly...

250
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,440
...you start liking things
that you don't like.

251
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,950
My true self wakes up?

252
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,390
Mu, fu, fu, maybe it's a charm.

253
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,560
Run through life in one line.

254
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,670
The sky is pink.

255
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,700
Bloomers just fly by.

256
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,640
Area of no experience.

257
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,270
Let's move on!

258
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,210
Happy smiling!

259
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:12,110
The dreaming maiden is sui sui chao!

260
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,920
Even the steep places breaststroke.

261
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,420
Let tomorrow be
the polka-dot pattern.

262
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,060
So let's do our best!

263
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,740
It's finally started.

264
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,310
We need to get someone
to cook some red rice for us.

265
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,650
You just thought of
something strange, didn't you?

266
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,540
