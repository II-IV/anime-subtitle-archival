1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,130
I found big business at Big Site!

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,830
I said it to those that may or
may not know about the value of money.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,030
I'm going to make
a huge profit with dojin!

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,780
It's fine that I made the statement, but...

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,440
...I've only drawn in school during class.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,110
By the way, it's this.

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,580
Where did you get that!

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,480
Hey!

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:28,950
Wait!

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:29,560
Papa, Mama, Najimi, John

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,990
Papa, Mama, Najimi, John
Come on!

12
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,530
Chance to get up!

13
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,130
Just decide.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,570
Chance to get dream!

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,240
Just decide.

16
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,480
Pushing?

17
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,740
Pulling?

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,310
Strategy! What to do?

19
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,920
Oh, what a night! (It won't get done.)
It won't stop.

20
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,990
Dream and delusion rampage battle!

21
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,460
The dazzling world.

22
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,960
That's a life encounter.

23
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,690
I can't? But I want to see.

24
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,930
But more and more
heart throbbing, heart throbbing...

25
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:22,030
...heart throbbing, heart throbbing
is what you get, right?

26
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,240
Why not! Why not! Why not! Why not!

27
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,780
Friendship that'll last a lifetime!

28
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,980
It's not like a hero,
but you feel something.

29
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,750
You, me, who? This, that?
Him, anyone's okay!

30
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,160
Anywhere it is!

31
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:47,290
If you're with everyone, it's the best!

32
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,370
Chance to get up!

33
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,100
Just decide.

34
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,700
Chance to get dream!

35
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,300
Just decide.

36
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,010
Dojin Work

37
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,380
I was surprised when Najimi said that...

38
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,920
...she was all of a sudden
going to start drawing dojinshi, but...

39
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,380
...as for me, I was happy.

40
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,400
Even if your motive is moneymaking...

41
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,500
But to make a manga,
you need to have knowledge...

42
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,130
...and have the references you need.

43
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,730
First, maybe it's good
to look into a good example?

44
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,850
Najimi?

45
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,640
Najimi?

46
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,250
Enforcement Bloomers

47
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,950
Are you serious?

48
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,930
No, that's...

49
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,460
Um...

50
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,130
You told me to read it.

51
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,300
You were the one that wrote it,
but I'm the one that's looked at like a perv...

52
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,980
Miss, you dropped your erotic book.

53
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,720
2nd Edition
The Naked Princess

54
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,990
Why did you have to go out of your way
to say that so everyone could hear!

55
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,890
I didn't say a lie though.

56
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,240
Here, it's in the
basement of this building.

57
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,600
Hold on a second.

58
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,240
I need to prepare myself for it, you know.

59
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,750
Huh?

60
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,940
Wait, Tsuyuri!

61
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,010
I can't believe her.

62
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,890
How could she leave me when
it's my first time at a store like this?

63
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,480
What am I going to do?

64
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,100
I don't have the courage to go in alone.

65
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,770
Huh?

66
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,100
We're going up.

67
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,800
Ah, okay...

68
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,210
I remember she was saying basement.

69
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,790
So there are people like them normally.

70
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,620
This whole time I thought that
it was this totally erotic thing, but...

71
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,630
...that was a narrow viewpoint.

72
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,030
Oh Father, Mother...

73
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:37,060
I have learned today that you shouldn't
assume anything with prejudice!

74
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,310
I take back what I just said!

75
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,090
Najimi?

76
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,590
What? Ah...

77
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,390
Yeah, um...

78
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,690
Why am I startled by
something on this level?

79
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,390
It's okay. It's okay, Najimi.

80
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,160
That's right. Everyone has an objective.

81
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,800
There's no one looking at me.

82
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,600
There is!

83
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,040
He's really looking at me!

84
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,440
What is?

85
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,240
What?

86
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,650
Oh, it's nothing.

87
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,180
He was looking at me.

88
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,580
On top of that,
he was pretty good-looking.

89
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,120
But after all, he is a stranger.

90
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,320
People that know me won't...

91
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,650
Oh, Najimi, it's you.

92
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,750
God, you are so mean!

93
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,690
Here, this is my recommendation.

94
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,330
Go buy it.

95
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,410
Wow, they sell stuff like this.

96
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,910
Wow, they sell stuff like this.
Mamimu Maid, No. 1 selling erotic game!

97
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:45,940
Mamimu Maid, No. 1 selling erotic game!

98
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,340
But it's really selling well...
Mamimu Maid, No. 1 selling erotic game!

99
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,810
You say it so easily.

100
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,710
Justice!

101
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,780
Sora!

102
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,610
Sorry to make you wait.

103
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,380
I was lonely!

104
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,980
I'm sorry, Sora.

105
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,260
When you grow older,
you can come in with me too.

106
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,390
We're going to go buy
some art supplies now...

107
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,760
...but what about you ladies?

108
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,100
I'll go too.

109
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,300
What about you, Najimi?

110
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,030
I'm going to go home.

111
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,510
I'm a little tired.

112
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,340
Okay. Then we'll part here.

113
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,680
See you.

114
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,720
Hurry and head home so you
can enjoy your 18+ game debut.

115
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,720
Don't say it out loud!

116
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,550
Though it's totally nerve-wracking.

117
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,720
I know it's reference, but I never thought
I would buy such an erotic thing.

118
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,260
If I ran into a friend right now...

119
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,460
Najimi!

120
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,540
You see them, right?

121
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,370
So I came to buy a computer, but I can't
figure out which one is good at all.

122
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,270
I know what you mean.

123
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,650
I get it, so let's say bye soon, Tomoko.

124
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,150
Today is...

125
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,140
Najimi, what did you buy?

126
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,890
Why!

127
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,930
Why?

128
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,390
'Cause you were shopping, right?

129
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,430
That...

130
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,530
Ah, yeah...

131
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,160
Let me see, let me see!

132
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,860
Don't!

133
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,670
Wh-Why?

134
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,200
Something bad is going to happen.

135
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,380
I-I understand.

136
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,080
Oh yeah, I have to
take care of some stuff.

137
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,110
What is it?

138
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,850
It's that...

139
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,150
Crab!

140
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,150
Crab?

141
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,720
I need to...

142
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,450
...go walk the crab.

143
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,650
Take it for a walk?

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,960
A crab?

145
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:50,930
That's right...

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,060
Are you serious?

147
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,490
I want to see!

148
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,360
I refuse!

149
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,930
Wait, Najimi!

150
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,270
Where are you going?

151
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,800
I have to?

152
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,810
No! Please stop, Master!

153
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,310
If you put such a thing in...

154
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,380
If you put red bean paste into the stew...

155
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,750
It's a mess! It's a mess!

156
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:21,890
Yes?

157
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,730
You can use the bath now.

158
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,830
O-Okay...

159
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,530
I can't...

160
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,470
It's too dangerous at my house.

161
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,930
If it comes down to it...

162
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,670
What? You're coming to my place?

163
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,210
Right now?

164
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,340
If you want, you can.

165
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,990
Now I can relax.

166
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,250
I won't see people
I know during the night!

167
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,760
They shouldn't be able
to stop me at this speed!

168
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,950
Okay, please stop.

169
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,250
That's how you come to me, huh?

170
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,730
Let me quickly confirm something.

171
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,630
Well, I guess it's okay.

172
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,060
As long as this bag is safe.

173
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
What's inside this?

174
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,200
Emergency situation occurring!

175
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,040
Are you going to look?

176
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,840
I'm sorry. This area
hasn't been safe recently.

177
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,470
Could you open it?

178
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,810
Don't trouble me!

179
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,220
W-Wait, miss!

180
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,280
What the heck am I doing!

181
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,220
It was whatever just popped into
my head and it's the worst decision!

182
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,820
I'm sorry!

183
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,370
Hold it!

184
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,800
Are you serious?

185
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,330
Why is it turning out this way!
I didn't do anything bad!

186
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,040
That's right. I'm not doing
anything wrong, so I just need to explain.

187
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,810
What am I doing
against one police officer?

188
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,450
He called backup!

189
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,500
Father, Mother...

190
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:06,130
I might be getting arrested.

191
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,930
Please come visit me at least.

192
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,890
Please make any gifts sweet things.

193
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,240
Miss, why did you run?

194
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,340
Well, um...

195
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,500
There's nothing in there.

196
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,890
I forgot it at home!

197
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,220
What, Najimi?

198
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:32,790
Tomoko...

199
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,060
Tomoko...
What's wrong?

200
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,070
Right now, I don't have
the energy to talk about it.

201
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,060
Najimi, you didn't...

202
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,970
It's okay.

203
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:50,340
Nothing as drastic as what
you are thinking happened.

204
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,380
In a way, it's more than
you can imagine, though.

205
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,540
Then get home safely.

206
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,950
Yes, I'm sorry for your trouble.

207
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,390
Really...

208
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,260
But why did you run
if there was nothing in it?

209
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,890
The item inside that bag can only
be seen by those who are superior.

210
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,800
Najimi?

211
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,770
Oh, there you are!

212
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,240
You dropped this on the street before.

213
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,240
It most likely fell out of that bag.

214
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,450
I'm glad I found you.

215
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,350
Hey, I'm superior, huh?

216
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,620
Great!

217
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,890
I also like that game.

218
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,230
Father, Mother...

219
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:55,330
I'm going to drink tonight.
I can't not drink.

220
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,370
Alcohol is for 20 or older.

221
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,960
Mysterious.

222
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,500
Before one knows...

223
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,300
If you take your first step...

224
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,440
Completely, totally unexpectedly...

225
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,380
...you start liking things
that you don't like.

226
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,890
My true self wakes up?

227
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,320
Mu, fu, fu, maybe it's a charm.

228
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,490
Run through life in one line.

229
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,600
The sky is pink.

230
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,630
Bloomers just fly by.

231
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,570
Area of no experience.

232
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,200
Let's move on!

233
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,140
Happy smiling!

234
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,040
The dreaming maiden is sui sui chao!

235
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,850
Even the steep places breaststroke.

236
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:20,350
Let tomorrow be
the polka-dot pattern.

237
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,000
So let's do our best!

238
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,330
If you're going to watch anime...

239
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,340
...you have to brighten up the room
and sit away from the TV.

240
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,750
Depending on the item,
in a different room from your family.
