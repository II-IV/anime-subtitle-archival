1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:03,800
Finally!

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,460
I have started working on my dojinshi!

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,500
Well, participation is at one's will.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,370
If this sells, it's the
celebrity road all the way!

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,040
Even Otome Road is unreliable.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,370
Look at my way of living.

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,380
Please, look after her
in a lukewarm way.

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,520
Chance to get up!

9
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,130
Just decide.

10
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,560
Chance to get dream!

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,230
Just decide.

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,470
Pushing?

13
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,730
Pulling?

14
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,300
Strategy! What to do?

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,910
Oh, what a night! (It won't get done.)
It won't stop.

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,980
Dream and delusion rampage battle!

17
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,450
The dazzling world.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,960
That's a life encounter.

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,690
I can't? But I want to see.

20
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,920
But more and more
heart throbbing, heart throbbing...

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,030
...heart throbbing, heart throbbing
is what you get, right?

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,230
Why not! Why not! Why not! Why not!

23
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,780
Friendship that'll last a lifetime!

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,970
It's not like a hero,
but you feel something.

25
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,750
You, me, who? This, that?
Him, anyone's okay!

26
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,150
Anywhere it is!

27
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:39,280
If you're with everyone, it's the best!

28
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,360
Chance to get up!

29
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,090
Just decide.

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,700
Chance to get dream!

31
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,300
Just decide.

32
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,000
Dojin Work

33
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,080
If I keep the story short...

34
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,120
...how do I draw a book
that's going to sell?

35
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,120
It's confidence.

36
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,220
'Cause, there's no point working
on it slowly and dragging.

37
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,720
So I thought it'd be fastest...

38
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,090
...if I learned from you,
someone who's already selling a lot.

39
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,630
Your techniques...

40
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,160
Techniques...

41
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,060
What the hell are you thinking?

42
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,060
Yeah...

43
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,600
So, what kind of book really sells?

44
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,160
That's of course one
with good drawings and is...

45
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,670
...erotic.

46
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,240
An interesting story.

47
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,810
There's no way I can draw that!

48
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,120
Are you making fun of me?

49
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,620
Other important components
I should bring up would be...

50
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,630
...love.

51
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,290
Love to your characters.

52
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,830
Love to your creation.

53
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,190
Love is what hits
the heart of the reader.

54
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,430
Well, I think I understand it, but...

55
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,870
So it's love.

56
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,740
I have the confidence to not lose
to anyone with that one.

57
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,940
That's because I've been given
lots of love from my father and mother.

58
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,210
3rd Edition
Am I... about to sell?

59
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,480
Lenma University (alias)

60
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,150
Najimi's not here?

61
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,660
She hasn't been here
for the past two or three days.

62
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:27,130
More like, it amazed me more
that you were in the same school.

63
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,030
But I am not a teacher.

64
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,140
I'm a student.

65
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,400
That amazed me even more.

66
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,410
It's Najimi.

67
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,300
I've got it.

68
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,170
I finally got it.

69
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,700
Najimi, you really got it?

70
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:42,810
Yeah...

71
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,870
Then...

72
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,780
...you're going to give birth to it?

73
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,410
I think it's going to be a struggle,
but do your best.

74
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,590
Oh come on, I did my best already.

75
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,490
And I experienced the struggles
of giving birth enough.

76
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,500
What, you gave birth already?

77
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,730
That's why I'm this tired!

78
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,530
I didn't realize at all.

79
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,900
I didn't come for a while.

80
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,900
You didn't come for a while...

81
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,500
...and you became uneasy...

82
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,570
...so that's when you confirmed it?

83
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,240
What are you talking
about "confirmed"?

84
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,510
You were worried all alone.

85
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,610
I discussed this with Justice.

86
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,510
Right, Justice?

87
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,420
What?

88
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,020
Calm down, Justice.

89
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:26,890
Yeah...

90
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,930
Did you choose the name already?

91
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,930
Yeah, "Love Typhoon."

92
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,060
How original.

93
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,630
It's amazing that the
public office accepted that.

94
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,500
Love Typhoon Osana...

95
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,740
What are you mumbling about?

96
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,740
So, who's the other party?

97
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,400
Other party?

98
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,740
What is the other party
thinking about this?

99
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,840
Oh, you mean the customers?

100
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,580
Customers?

101
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,320
Najimi!

102
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,060
Ouch, what was that for!

103
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,350
I've lost respect for you!

104
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,430
Stop this dating with
compensation right away!

105
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,090
What?

106
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,420
Love Typhoon...

107
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,720
Hey, I was talking about the manga!

108
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,770
I know.

109
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,800
Huh?

110
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,470
Well, that was funny.

111
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,500
No, it wasn't funny!

112
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,670
Justice clearly got the wrong idea.

113
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,180
Whose fault is that!

114
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,220
So, can I see that "Love Typhoon"?

115
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,380
Love Typhoon, The feeling to convey
Beauty Love

116
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,420
How is it?

117
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,690
Tell me your candid opinion.

118
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,860
Okay, well...

119
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,190
It's nice paper. It's really
good paper, seriously, yeah.

120
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,900
Najimi, you're lucky to be able to get this
kind of nice paper on your first publishing.

121
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,430
The texture on your fingers is great
and the gloss is a wonderful finish.

122
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,030
Tsuyuri, what is it?

123
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,470
Well, um...

124
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,340
There isn't much technique,
but the feelings you stuffed into this...

125
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,640
...will reach the readers.

126
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,880
Really? That makes me blush.

127
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,650
I'm becoming impatient.

128
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,890
No, nothing.

129
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,990
Najimi, what is this?

130
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,790
Oh, my pen name.

131
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,290
Beauty Love.

132
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,160
Well, um...

133
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,660
It's perfect for you, Najimi.
Seriously, yeah.

134
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,300
Especially the ending
to "love" isn't "bu" and...

135
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,570
...instead is "u" with dots
makes you feel the pickiness of it.

136
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,240
More like, sorry. I can't do it anymore.

137
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,180
What?

138
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,510
It's here! This day is here!

139
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,410
Aim for the 10,000 yen!

140
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,510
You obviously can't make 10,000
if you only have 30 copies.

141
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,030
Hey, don't pull me back to reality!

142
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,460
So Najimi, you're at 30 copies, huh?

143
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,590
Yes, that's right.
It's a thousandth of your amount!

144
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,270
Stop it!

145
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,000
No, it's okay, Sora.

146
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,030
To Najimi, this is a special piece.

147
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,170
These 30 copies are the
crystallization of love and tears that...

148
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,040
...totally overthrows my 30,000 copies.

149
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,050
He's taking this
misunderstanding all the way.

150
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,480
Najimi...

151
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,540
I'll help you.

152
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,740
It's not just your body anymore.

153
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,650
Just as I told you...

154
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,720
...you sent it out to the printer, huh?

155
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,130
How is it?

156
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,670
First of all, it's really good paper.
It's good paper, yeah, really.

157
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,230
It's your first publishing,
and you got good paper like this...

158
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,830
Wait, what?

159
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,740
You put your child's name as the title?

160
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,080
Ah, it's a proud child, Najimi.

161
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,340
You can't look at that because it's 18+.

162
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,850
Um, I'm sorry.

163
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,390
What the hell is up with her?

164
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,020
Let's go, Sora.

165
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,990
Yeah.

166
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,410
Is this that bad beyond belief?

167
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,480
What do you mean
by that way of laughing!

168
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,090
You're from that time!

169
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,990
Well, well.

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,360
What is it, huh?

171
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,900
Thank you very much.

172
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,240
Thank you very much!

173
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:36,870
We're so busy we don't even
have time to take a break.

174
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,170
Yeah, but it's fun.

175
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,710
The two that keep on moving even
if they don't have time to take a break.

176
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,310
The many customers
that watch over them.

177
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,980
Don't you feel it?

178
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,960
It's like a masquerade
for just the two of them.

179
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,720
Justice!

180
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,850
Sora!

181
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,730
Really...

182
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,990
Justice apparently sold out.

183
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,690
What?

184
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,570
He's asking, "How are you doing?"

185
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,070
This is bad.

186
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,970
If it keeps up like this, on top of
not selling at all, I'll be totally in debt!

187
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,100
Hey!

188
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,310
You're from the other day.

189
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,280
What?

190
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,350
You remembered me?

191
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,450
Well, I didn't want to remember, but...

192
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,920
This is something you drew?

193
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:36,430
This is the feeling of someone
reading the erotic comic you drew?

194
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,300
Yes, it's definitely embarrassing.

195
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,540
Like if you were exposing
your naked body in a public place.

196
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,910
It's covered, but that is
an unpleasant metaphor.

197
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,080
That will eventually turn into pleasure.

198
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,950
That's not likely.

199
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,510
It's pretty perverted.

200
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,960
Oh, you mean the comic.
I'm not like that.

201
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,650
More like, I'm imagining things that
the readers would like...

202
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,320
...and that's what I'm drawing,
so it's not what I'm into or anything.

203
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,460
What am I explaining myself for?

204
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,500
Instead, I'm a weird girl now.

205
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,770
I'm not having a
narrow view or anything.

206
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,140
That's right.

207
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,900
Also, just because
I wrote an erotic book...

208
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,970
...doesn't mean I'm
sexually frustrated or anything!

209
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,110
I know, and...

210
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,280
...I like women that draw
these kinds of manga too.

211
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,780
What is this sexual harassment!

212
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,150
Sexual harassment?

213
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,780
Is it a sexual harassment theme?

214
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,680
Hey, could we look at that?

215
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,630
Please get in line.

216
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,930
They're reading it.

217
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,800
So many men are looking at my erotic
drawings and reading my erotic lines!

218
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,710
Your hard work is coming across.

219
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:51,940
Can I get a copy?

220
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,250
Can I get a copy of this?

221
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,780
Are you serious?

222
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,820
Seriously.

223
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,950
I-It will be 500 yen.

224
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,920
Here.

225
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,490
I love you!

226
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,630
Wait, what is this all of a sudden?

227
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,330
How much is this?

228
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,700
Can I get one too?

229
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:16,640
We are not doing a service
where you get a hug if you buy it.

230
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,440
What a bummer...

231
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,500
I'm so sorry!

232
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,820
Thank you very much.

233
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,680
Well, if you would like, want to
go somewhere just the two of us...

234
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,150
Hey, what is it!

235
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,490
He's going to get me...

236
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,220
He's going to get me...
Are you the one?

237
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,520
You're going to take care of her, right?

238
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,160
What!

239
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,530
I don't know!

240
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,310
I finally sold one.

241
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,040
Please look this way!

242
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,840
Things that you can and
can't sell. Let's be careful.

243
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,030
Mysterious.

244
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,570
Before one knows...

245
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,370
If you take your first step...

246
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,500
Completely, totally unexpectedly...

247
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,440
...you start liking things
that you don't like.

248
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,950
My true self wakes up?

249
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,390
Mu, fu, fu, maybe it's a charm.

250
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,560
Run through life in one line.

251
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,670
The sky is pink.

252
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,700
Bloomers just fly by.

253
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,640
Area of no experience.

254
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,270
Let's move on!

255
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,210
Happy smiling!

256
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:12,110
The dreaming maiden is sui sui chao!

257
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,920
Even the steep places breaststroke.

258
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,420
Let tomorrow be
the polka-dot pattern.

259
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,060
So let's do our best!

260
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,100
In the next episode,
I will service you in 3 different ways.

261
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,370
3-way service...

262
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,540
4th Edition
Please stop, Master.
