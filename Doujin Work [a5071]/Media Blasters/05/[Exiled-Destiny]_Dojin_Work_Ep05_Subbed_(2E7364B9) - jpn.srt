1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,900
My part-time job is going well.

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,530
The plans for the
new book are pristine!

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,770
And then of course my second
dojin exhibition and sale event!

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,640
But something feels like it's missing.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,200
Something's missing?

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,270
Like, how do I say it...

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,810
Like passion or tension...

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,810
What about rivals for that?

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,380
That's true! In any manga,
the main character gets all fired up...

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,020
...due to the appearance of a rival!

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,470
Chance to get up!

12
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,070
Just decide.

13
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,500
Chance to get dream!

14
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,170
Just decide.

15
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,410
Pushing?

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,680
Pulling?

17
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,240
Strategy! What to do?

18
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,850
Oh, what a night! (It won't get done.)
It won't stop.

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,920
Dream and delusion rampage battle!

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,390
The dazzling world.

21
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,900
That's a life encounter.

22
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,630
I can't? But I want to see.

23
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,870
But more and more
heart throbbing, heart throbbing...

24
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,970
...heart throbbing, heart throbbing
is what you get, right?

25
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,170
Why not! Why not! Why not! Why not!

26
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,720
Friendship that'll last a lifetime!

27
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:35,920
It's not like a hero,
but you feel something.

28
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,690
You, me, who? This, that?
Him, anyone's okay!

29
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,090
Anywhere it is!

30
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:48,230
If you're with everyone, it's the best!

31
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,300
Chance to get up!

32
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,040
Just decide.

33
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,640
Chance to get dream!

34
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,240
Just decide.

35
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,940
Dojin Work

36
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,550
What's wrong?

37
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,060
With what?

38
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,230
You've looked like a
burned-out boxer since earlier.

39
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,320
Burned out, huh?

40
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,830
In a way, I think that's right.

41
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,460
Did something happen?

42
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,060
No, nothing...

43
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,770
It's not good to keep it
all bottled up inside.

44
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm not bottling it up.
I'm just a little tired.

45
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,300
I'm okay. I'm sorry to worry you.

46
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,840
Is that so?

47
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,850
Would you listen to me?

48
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,690
You do want to say it.

49
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,890
It was when I went to go
buy some dojinshi like usual.

50
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,490
Sorry to make you wait.

51
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,760
Those guys...

52
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,430
Please take care of me today.

53
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,960
Okay!

54
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,500
Najimi and Hoshi-kun were...

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,990
Why...

56
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,170
Where they eventually ended up was...

57
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,470
The love hotel district?

58
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,180
No way!

59
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,510
Najimi wouldn't do such a loose thing!

60
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,480
5th Edition
Let's do it together.

61
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,740
Why don't you ask her yourself?

62
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,150
No, it's not something for
me to go ahead and ask.

63
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,890
Plus, Najimi is an adult that
can make her own decisions.

64
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,860
That's true.

65
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,090
She is an adult female.

66
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:30,800
But the main problem is
if I should ask or not.

67
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,010
You're an adult that
can't make a decision.

68
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,930
Wouldn't she despise me and
say I'm intruding on her privacy?

69
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,480
In conclusion, you don't
have the courage to ask her.

70
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,750
No, wait a second.
It hasn't been decided as that yet.

71
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,510
Becoming incoherent is foolish.

72
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,520
That's true.

73
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,320
There are many options
for things to do in a love hotel.

74
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,950
This. That.

75
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,690
This kind of thing. That kind of thing.

76
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,700
Man, this really helps!

77
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,430
To tell you the honest truth,
doing it alone still isn't doing much.

78
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,930
You don't have to thank us.

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,200
It's more fun doing it all together.

80
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,870
That's true. If you're going to do it,
it's better to do it with two than one.

81
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,470
Hey!

82
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,980
If it's the three of us,
then it's on a plane of abnormality.

83
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,540
Could you stay quiet for a little?

84
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,610
What are you talking about?

85
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,550
It's too early for a little child.

86
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,950
Ask!

87
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,530
Ask.

88
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,360
What is it?

89
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,760
Um, well, how do I say it...

90
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,700
It's about that frame, but I think it's
better if you show it as a whole more.

91
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,640
Oh, thank you!

92
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,410
Oh, in your book,
they go to a love hotel in this scene.

93
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,140
Yeah.

94
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,310
Najimi, you're such a perv!

95
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,350
It's too early for a little child.

96
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,510
Right, Justice?

97
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,090
Najimi, you perv!

98
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,160
What was up with that?

99
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,250
No clue.

100
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,790
That guy named Hoshi...

101
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,340
To think he did
improper things to Najimi...

102
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,440
I want to make him
regret it in some way!

103
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,770
I know! Manga!

104
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,510
I'll make him realize it with manga!

105
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,080
The theme would be the
sinfulness of infidelity and...

106
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,840
...the magnificence of pure love.

107
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,410
It will compose the fall of a young man
who has committed many sins.

108
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,820
Okay, even if it becomes
hundreds of pages...

109
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,720
...I will complete it
just to show that guy!

110
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,520
Perverted Najimi

111
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,890
So, truthfully, how is it?

112
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,430
In this scene, a love
hotel comes up, but...

113
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,500
I've never been to a love hotel,
so I don't know how it really is.

114
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,410
And so my drawings end up
looking like a hospital room.

115
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,410
So you two went to
research a love hotel.

116
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,310
Hotel?

117
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,510
Did you go traveling somewhere?

118
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,310
I mean, they wouldn't let me in alone.

119
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,550
Why! Why!

120
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,810
You tried going in alone too, huh...

121
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,030
Plus, asking Justice
would be kind of weird.

122
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,230
And he would have totally
gotten the wrong idea.

123
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,860
He ended up totally having
the wrong idea anyway.

124
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,060
But Hoshi-kun is pretty fishy too.

125
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,770
He's fine!

126
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,710
There is nothing like that between us.

127
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,240
I can swear on that.

128
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,770
I know. It'd be more fake if you
were saying that something happened.

129
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,210
What is that "something"?

130
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,010
Well, show the result of
your hard work researching.

131
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,420
It's almost the next
exhibition and sale event.

132
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,590
What is that "something"?

133
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,830
This place is...

134
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,490
Oh, Najimi!

135
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,040
Ah, Justice!

136
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,830
How's your draft?

137
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,200
Are you going to make it in time?

138
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,300
I should be able to.

139
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,540
Najimi!

140
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,850
Najimi-san is mine!

141
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,750
I'm going to take good care of her.

142
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,810
Why you!

143
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,110
Justice, save me!

144
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,750
Najimi...

145
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,620
Najimi!

146
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,450
A dream? Oh no, I fell asleep...

147
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,680
Of course I did.

148
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,360
The last time I slept
was five days ago.

149
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,430
We came to help... you...

150
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,870
Oh, Najimi, you were okay?

151
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,280
Um, more like are you okay?

152
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,280
Is there something today?

153
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,670
You called me last night...

154
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,550
...saying that you haven't slept and you
won't be finished, so we came to help.

155
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,580
Oh, that's true. I'm sorry.

156
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,050
Hey, are you really okay?

157
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,920
Also, Sora's with us too.

158
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,590
I wanted to see you, Justice!

159
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,800
Sora...

160
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,540
Hey, you should rest a little.

161
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:03,310
But I need to write this epic piece
to reconfigure a certain individual!

162
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,770
Why are you saying
such a stupid thing?

163
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,740
This is amazing.

164
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,410
How many pages are you going for?

165
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,050
500 pages.

166
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,450
He's stupid.

167
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,220
Us three will try to work on it as much
as we can, so why don't you sleep?

168
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,230
It's okay!

169
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,230
Even I got a little better at it!

170
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,930
I will help too!

171
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,970
I understand.

172
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,630
Then I'm going to take this offer
and just for a little...

173
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,030
Okay! I'll do my best!

174
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,980
Hey Najimi, isn't that beta
too far outside of the line?

175
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,180
Is it?

176
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,910
Oh no, this wasn't
supposed to be beta!

177
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,610
At times like this, use the white ink.

178
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,550
Najimi, you are supposed to use
the white when the ink dries...

179
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,650
...too late...

180
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,630
It blended together!

181
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,330
It's okay, it's okay!

182
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,860
I can just wipe this with a tissue.

183
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,300
Oh man, it really spread!

184
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,560
You can't save this anymore.

185
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,310
Hey, that's enough. Thank you.

186
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,540
And complete.

187
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,680
It's here. I finally found it.

188
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,850
Thank you in advance for today...

189
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,050
No, thank you in advance...

190
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,250
It's the girl that's worse than me.

191
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,950
If you would like,
please have my new book.

192
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,500
Ah, mine too.

193
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,800
Did this girl laugh just now?

194
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,800
No, no, it's just me.
She just flatteringly smiled.

195
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,230
There's no way she can
laugh at me with this quality.

196
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,200
Good luck!

197
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,510
What's with that relaxed attitude?

198
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,810
Why is she cheering me on?

199
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,080
No way...

200
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,340
Does she...

201
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,090
...think I'm worse than her?

202
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,590
Comic Festival has now begun!

203
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,960
Okay, so Najimi-san's booth is...

204
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,460
Is this all dojinshi?

205
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,760
Wow...

206
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,140
Tsk, tsk, it's forbidden to run
within the exhibition center.

207
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,310
Hey, Sora.

208
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,280
Yeah, sorry. There were a lot of boxes.

209
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,550
I'm glad.

210
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,490
I heard about Najimi from Tsuyurin.

211
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,750
Tsuyurin?

212
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,890
The two of them were
taking pictures at the love hotel.

213
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,370
What a bothersome guy. Seriously...

214
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,270
It hung up.

215
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:49,340
Man, Justice is like Najimi's dad.
He's always worried.

216
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,110
Sora, you didn't use enough words.

217
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:57,370
You have to say that they were
just taking pictures of the love hotel.

218
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,150
Well, whatever. It's getting interesting.

219
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,350
Why did I run?

220
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,620
I don't have any reason to run.

221
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,520
I believed that you were
definitely going to come.

222
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,160
Hoshi-kun...

223
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,770
H-He's going to get me...

224
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,390
We have sold out!

225
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,710
Well, I guess the morning is like this.

226
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,430
Yeah, the usual pace.

227
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,500
Can't sell even one copy...

228
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:32,380
With that kind of quality,
of course it won't sell.

229
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,950
If I sell more than her,
that means I'm better than her.

230
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,450
This battle...

231
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,760
...the one that sells one copy...

232
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,450
...is the winner!

233
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,250
A couple is born!

234
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,430
Mysterious.

235
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,970
Before one knows...

236
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,770
If you take your first step...

237
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,900
Completely, totally unexpectedly...

238
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,840
...you start liking things
that you don't like.

239
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,350
My true self wakes up?

240
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,790
Mu, fu, fu, maybe it's a charm.

241
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,960
Run through life in one line.

242
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,070
The sky is pink.

243
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,100
Bloomers just fly by.

244
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,030
Area of no experience.

245
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,670
Let's move on!

246
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,610
Happy smiling!

247
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,510
The dreaming maiden is sui sui chao!

248
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,320
Even the steep places breaststroke.

249
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,820
Let tomorrow be
the polka-dot pattern.

250
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,460
So let's do our best!

251
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,100
Something that gets busier
than a summer festival...

252
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,570
...and somewhere you can
see more skin than at a beach.

253
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,970
When you think about it that way,
an exhibition event is pretty good, right?

254
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:39,980
6th Edition
I'm going to take one first.
