1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,720
Before the tan from the
summer training camp fades away...

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,560
...another sales exhibition.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,270
Where the heck do you have a tan?

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,430
How was the new one?

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,400
Yeah, it was fun making it!

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,480
Not whether you enjoyed it or not.
I meant the sales.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,280
Ah, oh!

8
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,990
Of course it will sell!

9
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,720
It'll most likely sell double the usual!

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:28,980
Meaning 10 copies...

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,530
Chance to get up!

12
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,130
Just decide.

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,560
Chance to get dream!

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,230
Just decide.

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,470
Pushing?

16
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,740
Pulling?

17
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,310
Strategy! What to do?

18
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,920
Oh, what a night! (It won't get done.)
It won't stop.

19
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,990
Dream and delusion rampage battle!

20
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,460
The dazzling world.

21
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,960
That's a life encounter.

22
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,690
I can't? But I want to see.

23
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,930
But more and more
heart throbbing, heart throbbing...

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,030
...heart throbbing, heart throbbing
is what you get, right?

25
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,240
Why not! Why not! Why not! Why not!

26
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,780
Friendship that'll last a lifetime!

27
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,980
It's not like a hero,
but you feel something.

28
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,750
You, me, who? This, that?
Him, anyone's okay!

29
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,160
Anywhere it is!

30
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:45,290
If you're with everyone, it's the best!

31
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,370
Chance to get up!

32
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,100
Just decide.

33
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,700
Chance to get dream!

34
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,300
Just decide.

35
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,010
Dojin Work

36
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,120
Ikebukuro

37
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,910
Brother, cheer up!

38
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,660
I'm sure something
can be done about it!

39
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,190
But that was an accident.

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,760
You're showing remorse, so if you
show them sincerity, they'll forgive you.

41
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,260
Sensei and the editor-in-chief
overlooked it for me.

42
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,100
Look...

43
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,300
But, sensei is already
busy with another job...

44
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,170
...so he doesn't have
time to redo it for us.

45
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,540
I could have put it in a plastic case
and so many other things too...

46
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,440
There are millions of fans all over the
country that are looking forward to it.

47
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,090
And because of me, that
popular manga is not in print.

48
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,590
Everything is my fault...

49
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,290
But there isn't a night
that doesn't come to an end.

50
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,390
If winter passes, spring comes.

51
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,660
When it rains, the land hardens!

52
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,040
I'm sorry! That didn't happen!

53
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,570
The rain thing didn't happen!

54
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,570
But before that, I need to hurry
and look for a replacement artist.

55
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,010
Meaning an artist to fill in?

56
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,020
Yeah, but finding one
on such short notice...

57
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,240
I have someone in mind!

58
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,820
11th Edition
Najimi's going to fly.

59
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,130
Thank you very much!

60
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,560
Yes, I was able to sell another copy!

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,660
I will too soon!

62
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,840
Even though I say that...

63
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,310
Today's book is the revised version
of the ocean training camp.

64
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,210
So to be honest,
it's still a little rough.

65
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,710
I'm in the same boat as you!

66
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,340
More like, why don't
you feel more resentment?

67
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,250
No, I am resenting!

68
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,120
Lies!

69
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,990
You aren't resenting at all!

70
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,490
What?

71
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,050
If you aren't resenting,
I'm going to resent!

72
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,490
What the heck is that...

73
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,290
Well, soon Hoshi-kun will come
and buy all 30 copies for me!

74
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,800
Again you count on Hoshi-san...

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,300
Najimi-san!

76
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,560
Hoshi-kun!

77
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,800
Najimi-san.

78
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,330
Clicking your tongue?

79
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,570
Oh, this is from the
ocean training camp?

80
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,610
It is!

81
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,210
It's the revised version,
but it's a self-confident work.

82
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,140
That's not what you said earlier!

83
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,210
Your brother came too?

84
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,650
Hey, you don't look so good.

85
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,590
Yeah, this is a Najimi-san manga!

86
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,790
Okay!

87
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,700
Hello, Beauty Love-sensei. Thank
you for taking care of me every time.

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,870
What does he mean
by taking care of him?

89
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,770
What?

90
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,130
Hey!

91
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,200
What? Toranoana sales division?

92
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,040
Yes!

93
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,870
I thought you were in college.

94
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,880
Until recently, I was
a T University student.

95
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:51,950
What?

96
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,610
You were smart.

97
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,480
But I realized the way
I should be going...

98
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,460
...is to spread the word
about Najimi-san's manga...

99
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,020
...so I quit.

100
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,590
He's not smart...

101
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,830
What a man of action!

102
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,060
Man, I'm flattered...

103
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,030
But is it okay that you
quit such a good school?

104
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,830
No, there's no problem.

105
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,910
Well, I thought my parents
looked at me in a certain way.

106
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,140
Like, this blank way...

107
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,410
But, it's my life!

108
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,070
Hey, I have to talk to you.

109
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,220
Don't tell me that...

110
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,280
...the person you have in mind to
be the replacement is that girl Najimi.

111
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,190
That's right.

112
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,550
Don't say such a stupid thing!

113
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,790
Regardless of how you
think about it, she's an amateur!

114
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,230
Please think about
the situation, Brother.

115
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,820
Right now, you're
desperate for anything, right?

116
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,860
Do you want our magazine
to put out just anything?

117
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,200
Hoshi-san!

118
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,840
Don't do it forcefully.

119
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,940
It's consensual...

120
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,470
No, it's forcefully!

121
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,440
Thank you very much!

122
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,510
We sold out.

123
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,940
Justice, we sold out!

124
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,780
Yeah. Thank you, Sora.

125
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,790
Justice!

126
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,980
Sora!

127
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,260
At Toranoana?

128
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,560
Distribution sale?

129
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,460
Yes!

130
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,130
Awesome! Good job, Hoshi-kun!

131
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,290
Wait, seriously?

132
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,770
It's okay.

133
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,500
I got the okay
under the condition that...

134
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,840
...if even one copy is left, I'm fired.

135
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,810
Are you serious...

136
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,910
Right now the anonymous
Najimi-san's book...

137
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,070
...will be read by a lot of
people and become a big hit!

138
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,850
And eventually you'll become
a business artist as you debut!

139
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,350
There isn't anything more honorable
than being able to be part of that!

140
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,350
Here Brother, read it thoroughly.

141
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,600
The book from the
shore house is really good.

142
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,530
The rest of Hoshi-kun's life
rests on Najimi's right hand.

143
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,090
It's... it's too heavy...

144
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,270
Ah, Junichiro, this is... as I thought...

145
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,570
No, right?

146
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,630
No, no, I'm not exactly saying no...

147
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,700
No!

148
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,740
No, no, no!

149
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,280
I can't agree on just
Najimi-san's book becoming famous!

150
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,650
What's that?

151
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,450
I can't agree on it either.

152
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,530
I guess I think a world where Najimi's
book is going to be a hit is too chaotic...

153
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,990
What do you mean by that?

154
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,330
Oh, don't take it the wrong way.

155
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,260
You can't take it a good way...

156
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:24,000
Well, we'll start by putting
30 copies on the shelf.

157
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,370
30 copies?

158
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,240
Yes.

159
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,670
Today I am going to
leave with a sample copy.

160
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,800
Please send the rest another day.

161
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,570
30 copies, huh?

162
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,740
Speaking of which,
the brother is with a publisher...

163
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,420
Let's have him read it!

164
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,250
Brother!

165
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:40,980
Yes?

166
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,690
It's not fair! It's all Najimi-san.

167
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,490
Please... please read mine too.

168
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,500
With this, I opened up the road
to become a business artist!

169
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,000
I'll see you around, Najimi-san.

170
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,270
Thank you.

171
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,500
U-Um!

172
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,040
Next time, not my brother, but...

173
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,150
...I wanted to introduce you
to my father and mother...

174
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,440
That kind of thing...

175
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,210
This is the one!

176
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,250
Well, um...

177
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,780
The book with the same angle faces
has been a popular topic on the web.

178
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,090
We've become fans!

179
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,020
That means...

180
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,390
Um...

181
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,190
I would like a copy of this!

182
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,090
Y-Yes.

183
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,060
Please give me one too!

184
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,300
Yes, thank you very much.

185
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,130
Yes, thank you very much.
So things like this happen, huh?

186
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,100
Thank you!

187
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,340
Najimi-san's challenging new piece!

188
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,270
I'm going to sell a lot of them!

189
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:37,570
More like, what happened?
You've been quiet for a while...

190
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,910
Yeah, the one that
was selling this book...

191
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,480
You mean Nido-san?

192
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,740
Yeah...

193
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,710
Something bad has happened.

194
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,010
Something bad?

195
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,020
That girl has fallen for me too.

196
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,080
That girl has fallen for me "too."

197
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,750
I don't get what you mean.

198
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,200
Your eyes are knotholes.

199
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,360
She held my hand
and with teary eyes...

200
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,030
It's not fair! It's all Najimi-san.

201
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,270
...that's what she said!

202
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,400
That's what she said?

203
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,640
More like, what's up with her "too"?

204
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,510
You're going to make me say it?

205
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,100
You are definitely
wrong with Najimi-san!

206
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,340
It's your misconception, Brother.

207
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,720
You are the one
with the misconception!

208
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,250
If she remains the Najimi Osana
she is now, there is no hope!

209
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,590
Also, I have enough people
in mind for the replacement artist!

210
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,460
What?

211
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,020
She said her name is Kaneru Nido...

212
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,600
Then, Junichiro!

213
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:41,170
If you are going to back Najimi Osana
that much, then make me understand!

214
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,170
Okay.

215
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,840
Distribution sale?

216
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,910
That's wonderful news.

217
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,350
Well, I don't know if it's
going to go well or not, but...

218
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,480
Kaneru-chan, what's wrong?

219
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,810
I think it's because her
new book isn't selling?

220
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:56,750
Hey!

221
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,090
That too, but...

222
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,130
So it is...

223
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,990
Although not selling isn't
something that just started.

224
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,290
You!

225
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,530
Nido-san, do you want a drink?

226
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,040
Najimi-san, you're weird.

227
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,500
What, I am?

228
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,430
No, no, the weird one is Nido-san.

229
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,310
Najimi-san, you sold out,
but you don't seem happy about it.

230
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,680
Wow, you're right!

231
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,180
Congratulations, Najimi.

232
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:28,690
No, apparently it's the talk of the web,
it's selling because of how bad it is...

233
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,820
You're going too far away!

234
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,190
Najimi-san, you're going
somewhere too far above us!

235
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,160
W-What are you saying?

236
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,160
Kaneru-chan, Najimi
isn't going anywhere.

237
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,060
There, there, calm down.

238
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,360
Najimi-san.

239
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,100
Huh? Hoshi-kun, what's the matter?
Did you forget something?

240
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,940
You forgot to buy my book, right?

241
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,500
I don't think that's a possibility.

242
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,740
To be honest, it's about
the distribution sales thing...

243
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,050
That was canceled?

244
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,210
I thought so.

245
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,820
You can't get fired from the
company for something like that.

246
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,820
Please make it 100 copies!

247
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,750
Not 30 copies, 100 copies!

248
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,060
Wow!

249
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,320
Well, I don't think that is...

250
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,230
Then please send
100 copies in a couple of days.

251
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,060
Also, may I take
another copy as a sample?

252
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,500
Ah, it sold out earlier...

253
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,830
It sold out.

254
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,570
What did?

255
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,800
The new book.

256
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,040
Whose?

257
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,140
Najimi's!

258
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,370
Why?

259
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,280
I don't know why either...

260
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,880
Sold out.
Thank you very much.
Beauty Love House.

261
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,550
That's amazing!

262
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,120
This is possible. It's possible!

263
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,910
Hey, Hoshi-kun?

264
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,620
Why 100 copies all of a sudden?

265
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,660
I made a promise with my brother.

266
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,490
Promise?

267
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,460
Yes.

268
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,990
If the 100 copies of the book
sell out in three days...

269
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,000
...you will be drawing a
complete piece in his magazine!

270
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,540
Najimi, you've flown too far above us!

271
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,530
Mysterious.

272
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,070
Before one knows...

273
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,870
If you take your first step...

274
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,000
Completely, totally unexpectedly...

275
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,940
...you start liking things
that you don't like.

276
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,450
My true self wakes up?

277
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,890
Mu, fu, fu, maybe it's a charm.

278
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,060
Run through life in one line.

279
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,170
The sky is pink.

280
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,200
Bloomers just fly by.

281
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,140
Area of no experience.

282
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,770
Let's move on!

283
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,710
Happy smiling!

284
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:11,610
The dreaming maiden is sui sui chao!

285
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,420
Even the steep places breaststroke.

286
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,920
Let tomorrow be
the polka-dot pattern.

287
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,560
So let's do our best!

288
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,700
When there are hello's,
there are good-bye's.

289
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,270
Next episode, the last episode...

290
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,280
Or in a way, a beginning.

291
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,040
12th Edition
I still want to do it, I want to do it more.
