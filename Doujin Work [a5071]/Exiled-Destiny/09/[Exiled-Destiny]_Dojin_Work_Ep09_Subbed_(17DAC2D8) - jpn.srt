1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,690
It's summer!

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,230
It's almost over.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,230
It's the beach!

4
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,790
Sticky, salty wind.

5
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:07,300
The bright sun!

6
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,100
UV rays that eat away at your skin.

7
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,370
At night in a yukata
and a charming figure.

8
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,910
Blood service to the
mosquitoes that come flying by.

9
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,600
H-Hopes are up for
a heart-pounding meeting!

10
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,740
In the end, it's only
casual and at that moment.

11
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,040
Really good meals!

12
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,280
On top of being worn out,
soumen noodles every day.

13
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,380
If not that, then food
poisoning from something else.

14
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,980
What you hate is summer!

15
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,490
Or is it us?

16
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,980
I love both of them.

17
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,530
Chance to get up!

18
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,130
Just decide.

19
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,570
Chance to get dream!

20
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,230
Just decide.

21
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,470
Pushing?

22
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,740
Pulling?

23
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,310
Strategy! What to do?

24
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,920
Oh, what a night! (It won't get done.)
It won't stop.

25
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,990
Dream and delusion rampage battle!

26
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,460
The dazzling world.

27
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,960
That's a life encounter.

28
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,690
I can't? But I want to see.

29
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,930
But more and more
heart throbbing, heart throbbing...

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,030
...heart throbbing, heart throbbing
is what you get, right?

31
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,240
Why not! Why not! Why not! Why not!

32
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,780
Friendship that'll last a lifetime!

33
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,980
It's not like a hero,
but you feel something.

34
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,750
You, me, who? This, that?
Him, anyone's okay!

35
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,160
Anywhere it is!

36
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:46,290
If you're with everyone, it's the best!

37
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,370
Chance to get up!

38
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,100
Just decide.

39
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,700
Chance to get dream!

40
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,300
Just decide.

41
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,010
Dojin Work

42
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,920
Something like this
is good once in a while.

43
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,680
When you think about it, we
weren't doing anything summer-like.

44
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,220
I think the sales and exhibition
event is very summer-like.

45
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,320
Not like that. More like
under the infinite blue sky...

46
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,700
You can't!

47
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,070
Look Sora, it's the ocean!
Isn't it amazing?

48
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,630
I get it, Kaneru-chan...

49
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,360
Take your shoes off...

50
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,870
It's such bad manners!

51
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,210
Isn't she 24?

52
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,870
Yeah, even though
we didn't come to play...

53
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,880
Seriously.

54
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,980
Huh? What do you mean?

55
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,880
9th Edition
There's a slip-up too! Dojin meeting!

56
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,820
What!

57
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:43,880
Training camp?

58
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,160
Right.

59
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,490
Even at the ocean,
we have to draw dojinshi?

60
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,130
As you wished,
it's the infinite blue sky.

61
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,860
No, no, there are acts that are
perfect for the blue sky, right?

62
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,860
Najimi, you are so bold...

63
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,270
I don't think this is
considered a change of mood!

64
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,870
If you have a problem, please say it
to the planner of this training camp.

65
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,480
Planner?

66
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,910
Justice!

67
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,350
Yeah, it's Justice!

68
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,480
There's something wrong with you!

69
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,780
Don't worry.

70
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,480
This suit is perfect in both
breathability and repelling water.

71
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,850
Not that!

72
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,120
Your clothes don't fit too, but why do
we have to draw dojin at the ocean?

73
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,100
Najimi-san, why don't we
think about it this way?

74
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,270
We pile up the sunlight that hits us
and then use all that solar power as...

75
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,100
...one big ball of energy so our
drawings become more dynamic!

76
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,910
Even if you say something like a sci-fi
hero, it's not going to hit home with me.

77
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,810
Plus...

78
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,610
They say that the density
of a human's amniotic fluids...

79
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,340
...is close to that of ocean water.

80
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,610
Really...

81
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,650
Meaning, putting yourself in the
same environment as when you were...

82
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,250
...inside your mother's womb
will bring more nostalgia to your story.

83
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,730
Why would nostalgia be needed
to draw a perverted manga!

84
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,850
Anyhow, I'm not going to draw!

85
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:57,900
Really...

86
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,590
Then that becomes a problem...

87
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,090
What does?

88
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,110
Dojinshi sale and
exhibition event open?

89
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:11,780
Beauty Love and Kaneru Nido's
newly written dojinshi limited sales.

90
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,750
This is amazing, Najimi!

91
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,750
Our books are being announced!

92
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,150
The opening is in the
evening two days from now!

93
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,620
There's no way! What are you guys
doing announcing it on your own?

94
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,220
Seriously, how much
did you hand out?

95
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,360
Najimi-san! We were waiting!

96
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,130
I handed out the fliers to
the next town over! 5,000 of them!

97
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,860
I hope you get a lot of customers!

98
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,600
Chase after her, Hoshi!

99
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,610
What? O-Okay.

100
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:55,290
Okay, both of you. Throw all the
freedom you get to the draft sheet!

101
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,910
Yes!

102
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,360
More than freedom, the
feeling of being trapped is stronger.

103
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,660
It's okay!

104
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,530
I'm sure if we're backed into a corner,
we can draw something good!

105
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,900
The ocean is over there.

106
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,590
It's like the last stand!

107
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,600
No, it's that I want to
jump in there right now...

108
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,060
Najimi-san...

109
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,900
A-Are you okay?

110
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,310
Yeah, I'm okay.

111
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,510
No, Hoshi-kun...

112
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,350
I'm okay...

113
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,510
More like...

114
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,180
Najimi-san, what you are wearing is...

115
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:31,420
What? Oh, I bought it and not having worn
it even once was bothering me, so...

116
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,250
Is it weird?

117
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,760
Not at all! It's awesome!

118
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,990
Thank you.

119
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,590
By the way, Hoshi-kun, you don't have
to work, so you can go have fun!

120
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,400
Ah, yeah, that's true, but...

121
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,960
Hoshi-kun has to service Justice.

122
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,470
Well, um, yeah...

123
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,410
Even the time we went to
research the hotel together!

124
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,570
I was thinking maybe
if we got into a good situation...

125
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,520
But in the end it didn't become
a good situation anyway!

126
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,210
It's because I let
that slip off my tongue.

127
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,450
N-No...

128
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,130
Servicing...

129
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,690
My gosh...

130
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,200
Justice!

131
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,330
Let's swim together!

132
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,190
I'm sorry, Sora.

133
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,000
During the day, a lot
of people come here.

134
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,840
It should settle down by evening...

135
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,580
Why'd you take a job
at the beach hut anyway?

136
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,080
Then, Najimi, could we play?

137
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,080
I can't play while I'm in this situation.

138
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,080
Then you want to play with me?

139
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,080
N-No!

140
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,020
Sora-chan, I'll play with you.

141
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,930
Wait, Nido-san,
you don't have time though!

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,760
Tsuyuri, play with Sora...

143
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,890
Seems like that's
not going to happen.

144
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:51,530
I'm going to go thoroughly research
the guys' bodies on the beach!

145
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,970
If you say it that straightforwardly...

146
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,310
It's true that that would
most likely be a good harvest.

147
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,070
Please do so.

148
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,210
Yes! Okay, Sora-chan, let's go!

149
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,010
Yeah!

150
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,550
Um, Najimi-san, would you also like
to do some sketches on the beach?

151
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,180
If you want, I can be your model...

152
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,350
How is the cutting
edge of this blade?

153
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,560
I'll go make some yakisoba...

154
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,630
Splish-splash! Splish-splash!

155
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,430
Nido-san, you're not
going in the ocean?

156
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,800
I can't swim...

157
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,810
...but, I am watching
over Sora-chan perfectly!

158
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,880
But if something happens,
you can't swim, right?

159
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,310
I'll call someone with my loud voice!

160
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,610
Please do your best.

161
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,480
Hey, Aioros...

162
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,990
Am I doing a good job
being a guardian?

163
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,060
No! Aioros!

164
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,530
Oh, it's so relaxing!

165
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,570
Tatami flooring is perfect
for Japanese people.

166
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,080
The saying that changing the environment
will help you come up with new ideas is a lie.

167
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,670
I didn't come up with
any good ideas at all.

168
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,680
How about you, Nido-san?

169
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,150
The bath is available now.

170
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,120
Kaneru-chan!

171
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,220
The bath was really good.

172
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,420
Really?

173
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,390
How is it? Are you guys fighting
being in the same room?

174
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,220
We aren't!

175
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,920
By the way, where is
Justice and Hoshi-kun?

176
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,970
The beach.

177
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,800
The two of them
at the beach at night...

178
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,630
How daring!

179
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,630
I never thought I would
have to sleep here with you...

180
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,640
I thought I'd get to sleep under
the same roof as Najimi-san...

181
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,510
Huh?

182
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,550
Oh, nothing...

183
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,840
I borrowed this car
from my older brother.

184
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,650
I see, then I have
to thank your brother.

185
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,750
You'll most likely meet
him eventually, Justice-san...

186
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,650
What do you mean by that?

187
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,820
As the groom's family
and the bride's friend.

188
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,290
Really? Where is that
confidence coming from?

189
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,330
M-Maybe youthfulness...

190
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,730
Really...

191
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,840
What's so wrong about it?

192
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,670
Please stop being
stubborn and accept it!

193
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,200
As a healthy man...

194
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,240
...I've been holding back things
with my all that I shouldn't!

195
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,650
What is youthfulness?

196
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,520
Man, I accidentally
stayed in the bath too long.

197
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,190
The power of the bath is terrifying.

198
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,760
Hey, Najimi-san, wear
this instead of the yukata!

199
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,320
Um, this is such a good chance,
so I'm going to wear the yukata...

200
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,860
A matching look?

201
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,630
Yeah!

202
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,830
I bought it for my comrade
who's working hard with me!

203
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,140
No, it's okay...

204
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,070
What?

205
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,710
I bought it for the two of us...

206
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,670
It makes you feel like
working really hard.

207
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,450
I hope...

208
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,520
Najimi.

209
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,020
You better not have
come to bother us...

210
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,320
Want to go grocery shopping?

211
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,860
Right now, even a
second or a minute is critical.

212
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,290
Go back, go back!

213
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,560
We can't get any meals here.

214
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,230
What?

215
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,030
Justice said no because
it's a training camp.

216
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,830
That guy...

217
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,130
Forget it! You won't die if you
don't eat anything till tomorrow!

218
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:15,570
No! If I don't eat dinner, I... I...

219
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,070
This is my snack, but do you want it?

220
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,310
That's not enough!

221
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,110
Okay, okay!

222
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,670
Once we buy it,
we're coming straight back!

223
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,150
Yeah, grocery shopping!

224
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,810
Grocery shopping, grocery shopping!

225
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,720
Let's borrow the car from
Hoshi-kun and go to the station.

226
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,990
What, Tsuyuri, you can drive?

227
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,330
Most likely...

228
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,230
Most likely...
Hey!

229
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,660
Wait, the two of them aren't here.

230
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:40,960
They're over there.

231
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,460
Justice!

232
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,360
Hoshi-san!

233
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,740
W-What happened?

234
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,370
Seems like he was
stung by a jellyfish and sank.

235
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,940
He's not breathing.

236
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:50,980
What?

237
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,480
What? Leave it to me!

238
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,420
Thank goodness,
that could have been bad!

239
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,420
N-Nido-san?

240
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,850
Nosebleed...

241
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,430
N-No, it's not!

242
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,760
H-Hey, what's the matter, Nido-san?

243
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,030
It's not!

244
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,500
Wait!

245
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,270
I became a terrible hassle.

246
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,740
I'm sorry. I never thought
you would save me.

247
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,740
What are you saying?

248
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,810
You are one of our valued friends!

249
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,280
Then, about me and Najimi-san...

250
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,880
That's a different story.

251
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,780
You should rest for
a little while in our room.

252
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,760
Also, we want to go grocery
shopping, so could we borrow your car?

253
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,730
Ah, I see.

254
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,260
Here you go.

255
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,260
Excuse me.

256
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,770
Yes.

257
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,770
Are you Junichiro's friends?

258
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,070
Yes...

259
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,540
You are?

260
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,500
The next episode is also
a story at the shore.

261
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,270
Fall down...

262
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,530
Mysterious.

263
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,070
Before one knows...

264
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,870
If you take your first step...

265
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,000
Completely, totally unexpectedly...

266
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,940
...you start liking things
that you don't like.

267
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,450
My true self wakes up?

268
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,890
Mu, fu, fu, maybe it's a charm.

269
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,060
Run through life in one line.

270
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,170
The sky is pink.

271
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,200
Bloomers just fly by.

272
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,140
Area of no experience.

273
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,770
Let's move on!

274
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,710
Happy smiling!

275
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:11,610
The dreaming maiden is sui sui chao!

276
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,420
Even the steep places breaststroke.

277
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,920
Let tomorrow be
the polka-dot pattern.

278
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,560
So let's do our best!

279
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,970
Next episode, we come here and a
mysterious new character shows up.

280
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,570
We come here and it's
actually a normal kind of preview.

281
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,050
10th Edition
This is what it's come to.
