1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:06,190
Finally! The day of showing my
drawings that were reborn has come!

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,830
Finally the outcome of the show done
with Nido-san is going to be shown.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:09,870
What about your self-confidence?

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,840
Of course I have it! So much!

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,870
Even if Nido-san puts
out a really good book?

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,100
Of course.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,970
I don't think that's
going to be good for me.

8
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,110
Even if Hoshi-kun
doesn't buy it from you?

9
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,120
That's going to
set me back pretty far.

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,780
I'll be cheering you on.

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,990
You demon!

12
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,530
Chance to get up!

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,130
Just decide.

14
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,570
Chance to get dream!

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,230
Just decide.

16
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,470
Pushing?

17
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,740
Pulling?

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,310
Strategy! What to do?

19
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,920
Oh, what a night! (It won't get done.)
It won't stop.

20
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,990
Dream and delusion rampage battle!

21
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,460
The dazzling world.

22
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,960
That's a life encounter.

23
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,690
I can't? But I want to see.

24
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,930
But more and more
heart throbbing, heart throbbing...

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,030
...heart throbbing, heart throbbing
is what you get, right?

26
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,240
Why not! Why not! Why not! Why not!

27
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,780
Friendship that'll last a lifetime!

28
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,980
It's not like a hero,
but you feel something.

29
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,750
You, me, who? This, that?
Him, anyone's okay!

30
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,160
Anywhere it is!

31
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:46,290
If you're with everyone, it's the best!

32
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,370
Chance to get up!

33
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,100
Just decide.

34
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,700
Chance to get dream!

35
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,300
Just decide.

36
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,010
Dojin Work

37
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,250
I still can't get used
to this full train ride.

38
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,050
This is still the real thrill.

39
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,590
I'm sorry. Are you okay...

40
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,390
Nido-san?

41
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,490
Najimi-san?

42
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,060
Oh, Tsuyuri-san, good morning!

43
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,570
Good morning. I'm looking
forward to you two's battle.

44
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,500
It's not a battle.

45
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,300
I'm just going to be
selling at my own pace.

46
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,900
M-Me too!

47
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,840
Oh, I thought you stepped on
her foot because the battle started.

48
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,020
I wouldn't do such a cheap thing!

49
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,060
I-I don't really care
about such a thing.

50
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,050
I said it wasn't on purpose!

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,400
Please, Najimi-san.

52
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,020
No, thank you.

53
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,530
Go ahead, Nido-san.

54
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,440
Oh, well, I should
sell out at lunch time, and...

55
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,370
...I'll be able to sit down because
it will be a time when it's not crowded.

56
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,740
I'm young, so I'll be fine.

57
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,880
8th Edition
You can see everything!

58
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,720
Over there!

59
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,120
Oh, you were late, Nido-san.

60
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,030
Same to you, Najimi-san.
I thought you weren't participating today.

61
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,630
Um, excuse me.

62
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,500
Please don't run
within the exhibition hall.

63
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,740
I-I'm sorry...

64
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,340
Thank you.

65
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,710
Thank you very much.

66
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,810
Thank you very much!

67
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,680
Justice, we sold half of it!

68
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,610
Huh?

69
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,450
Justice?

70
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:52,220
Oh, I'm sorry, Sora.
I was just thinking of something.

71
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,250
Is there something
that's bothering you?

72
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,700
Could you tell me?

73
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,160
Yeah, it's about Najimi's new book.

74
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,000
She let you see it?

75
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,630
Yeah, but...

76
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,470
How is it? You're so astonished
you can't even say anything.

77
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,310
No, this is...

78
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,710
We don't have words
because we are fed up.

79
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:21,420
The angle of this character's
face is always the same.

80
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,460
On top of that,
you didn't draw any bodies at all.

81
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,560
Wow, you guys both were able
to figure that out right away.

82
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,330
It's harder to pretend
that we don't see it.

83
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,970
This next Comic Festival is the day
of the battle with Nido-san, right?

84
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:42,580
So I need to make
a book with higher quality.

85
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,740
I get it!

86
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,740
The only way you can draw
is from this angle, so you...

87
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,840
...put it all on the line for this battle.

88
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,850
Yes.

89
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,380
Good idea, right?

90
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:57,260
Yeah, you'd most likely be able
to fool maybe two or three...

91
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,290
Hooray!

92
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,290
She's fine with two or three people.

93
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,220
That's not good.

94
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,000
Then let's sell it off fast
and go cheer Najimi on.

95
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,910
Gosh, Justice,
you're like Najimi's dad.

96
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,240
Sora...

97
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,710
Justice!

98
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,470
Thank you, Sora!

99
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,250
Justice!

100
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,210
Thank you very much!

101
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,250
It finally died down a little.

102
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,730
How are you over there?

103
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,490
Q-Quite well!

104
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,190
Finally on the wave!

105
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,730
Just the enthusiasm though...

106
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,500
Oh yeah, if you would like to,
want to read my new book?

107
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,230
Wow, looks like you
have a lot of confidence.

108
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,140
Ah, yeah...

109
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,300
Looks like you worked
really hard on the cover, but...

110
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,570
...the most important
thing is what's inside.

111
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,750
It's good!

112
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,480
One person out of that two
or three was right next to you.

113
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,220
How did you in such a
short amount of time...

114
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,090
I can't believe it.

115
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,490
Accept the truth right in front of you.

116
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,560
Nido-san, don't be fooled!

117
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,170
In this book, all the
faces are the same angle.

118
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,670
But it's still good.

119
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,730
R-Right?

120
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,900
No, no, it means that she can't
draw anything other than that.

121
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,580
I get it! You figured out what
you can draw and you drew!

122
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,250
How smart!

123
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,180
I don't think that's right either, but...

124
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,250
...more like, she didn't
draw any bodies in this book.

125
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,860
Meaning it's an erotic manga, but...

126
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:40,760
...it's not erotic.

127
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,560
So don't worry. You still
can't figure out the outcome.

128
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,270
Reverse Upper Classmen Homerun

129
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,760
Reverse Upper Classmen Homerun
S-So what about your new book?

130
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,100
May I look?

131
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,660
That's...

132
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,340
No, no! Tsuyuri-san said I should
do one for the female audience...

133
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,480
So it doesn't mean that
I like that kind of stuff.

134
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,250
When I started drawing, you could
say that the pen just kept on going...

135
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:09,780
I guess...

136
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,390
Tsuyuri, did you look at this?

137
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,290
It's the first time
I've seen the printed...

138
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,960
No, of course I still
think I'm really bad.

139
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,930
But I think it's drawn more
erotically than Najimi-san's.

140
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,000
Yeah, it is erotic.

141
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,300
R-Really?

142
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,870
Yes, it's too erotic
to the point it won't sell.

143
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,100
Don't you think
that's a little too much?

144
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,150
Well, like here, you forgot
to put the mosaic over it...

145
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,780
Due to certain circumstances,
there are no sales of new books.

146
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,050
Well, it's better than
finding out after you sold them...

147
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,280
Right?

148
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,420
Nido-san, I fixed
everything with a marker.

149
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,290
So now you can sell it!

150
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,690
Tsuyuri-san!

151
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,360
The battle is back
at the starting point!

152
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,300
Y-You're right...

153
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,270
It's been fixed, so it's all good now!

154
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,070
It was perverted
beyond my imagination.

155
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,540
You are seriously
such a perverted girl.

156
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,910
What are you doing?

157
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,350
H-Hello, Najimi-san.

158
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,050
Tsuyuri-san and Kaneru-san
are also here, huh?

159
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,790
What, you're acquaintances?

160
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,190
Thank you for the other day.

161
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,800
What about Justice-san's new book?

162
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,360
No...

163
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:26,790
I didn't buy it...

164
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,520
That's bad!

165
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,470
You have to go to
the person you like first!

166
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,710
Yes, that's why I'm here...

167
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:39,810
Oh yeah, even if he doesn't buy it,
he can get it straight from Justice-san.

168
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,110
Maybe I was being a little too nosey?

169
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,440
Hoshi-san, here.

170
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,020
I think my book is a
genre that you would like.

171
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,020
Okay...

172
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,890
You like it, right?

173
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,460
R-Regardless of if I like it or not...

174
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,860
...it's very well-made.

175
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,500
You worked hard on it.

176
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,690
Please sell me a copy.

177
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,400
Hooray! Thank you very much!

178
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:05,840
What?

179
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,980
Ah, no, Hoshi-kun is my fan...

180
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,910
What?

181
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,710
Here's the new book.

182
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,010
Yes.

183
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,950
What? It's so well-drawn!

184
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,380
I'm looking forward to the inside too!

185
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,710
If you want, you want
to buy like three copies?

186
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,890
What happened with this?

187
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,930
It's good, right? I worked hard!

188
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,960
Usually, even though you are
inexperienced, you work hard...

189
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:32,930
Huh?

190
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,200
It's just like you are
totally scared of failing with this...

191
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,730
The manga that I like of yours is...

192
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,210
...not like this!

193
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,070
Hoshi-kun...

194
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,400
Really...

195
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,210
He actually liked Najimi's manga.

196
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,790
He's Najimi-san's fan,
but he only bought my book.

197
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,090
I was right. For people that know,
they know which book is better!

198
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,920
May I get a copy?

199
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,220
Thank you very much!

200
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:03,930
Oh, can I get a copy too?

201
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:04,300
Oh, can I get a copy too?
How much is it?

202
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:04,330
How much is it?

203
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:04,930
May I have a copy?
How much is it?

204
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:04,970
May I have a copy?

205
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:05,760
May I have a copy?
Please give me one too!

206
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,200
Thank you very much!

207
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,170
Me too!

208
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,740
Najimi...

209
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,340
Um, how's it going?

210
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,870
Did you sell any?

211
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,640
I sold five copies!

212
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,840
Yeah!

213
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,380
How great! Congratulations.

214
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,040
Amazing!

215
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,750
Keep it up just like this next time.

216
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,180
Y-Yeah!

217
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,390
Cheer up. Even if it was
just one copy, you sold it.

218
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,130
On top of that, who cares
about winning or losing?

219
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,130
But that one copy I sold was
a copy bought by your fan.

220
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,870
Shouldn't it have the value of
five copies or more with just one copy?

221
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,170
One copy is one copy.

222
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,480
Just accept the fact that you lost!

223
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:58,110
Hey, you were the one that said
winning or losing doesn't matter...

224
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,980
Kaneru-chan.

225
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,430
Najimi.

226
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,460
How about the victory?

227
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,500
Well, to tell you the truth, it hurt that
my only fan didn't buy from me, but...

228
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,010
I thought I should
create something better.

229
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,240
Really...

230
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,540
What?

231
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,010
I was thinking what
happened to making money?

232
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,080
Of course that is the
number one priority!

233
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,880
I meant something good for money!

234
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,290
Is that so?

235
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,020
That's right!

236
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:43,990
Father, Mother, I will not be
hooked on dojin activities or anything!

237
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,770
I'll make it feel better for you.

238
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,140
What are you talking about!

239
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:59,310
Najimi, you can see everything...

240
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,530
Mysterious.

241
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,070
Before one knows...

242
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,870
If you take your first step...

243
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,000
Completely, totally unexpectedly...

244
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,940
...you start liking things
that you don't like.

245
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,450
My true self wakes up?

246
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,890
Mu, fu, fu, maybe it's a charm.

247
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,060
Run through life in one line.

248
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,170
The sky is pink.

249
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,200
Bloomers just fly by.

250
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,140
Area of no experience.

251
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,770
Let's move on!

252
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,710
Happy smiling!

253
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:11,610
The dreaming maiden is sui sui chao!

254
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,420
Even the steep places breaststroke.

255
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,920
Let tomorrow be
the polka-dot pattern.

256
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,560
So let's do our best!

257
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,570
Sorry to keep you waiting.

258
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:35,940
Next episode, bathing suits, after-bath...

259
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:39,100
We will have a lot of that stocked
and will be waiting for everyone.

260
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,040
9th Edition
There's a slip up too! Dojin meeting!
