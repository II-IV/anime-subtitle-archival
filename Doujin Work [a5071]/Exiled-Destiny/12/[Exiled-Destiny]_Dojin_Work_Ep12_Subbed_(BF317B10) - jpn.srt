1
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,530
Chance to get up!

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,140
Just decide.

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,570
Chance to get dream!

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,240
Just decide.

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,480
Pushing?

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,740
Pulling?

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,310
Strategy! What to do?

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,920
Oh, what a night! (It won't get done.)
It won't stop.

9
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,990
Dream and delusion rampage battle!

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,460
The dazzling world.

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,970
That's a life encounter.

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,700
I can't? But I want to see.

13
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,930
But more and more
heart throbbing, heart throbbing...

14
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:51,040
...heart throbbing, heart throbbing
is what you get, right?

15
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,240
Why not! Why not! Why not! Why not!

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,790
Friendship that'll last a lifetime!

17
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,980
It's not like a hero,
but you feel something.

18
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,760
You, me, who? This, that?
Him, anyone's okay!

19
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,160
Anywhere it is!

20
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:16,290
If you're with everyone, it's the best!

21
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,370
Chance to get up!

22
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,100
Just decide.

23
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,710
Chance to get dream!

24
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,310
Just decide.

25
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,010
Dojin Work

26
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,850
How nice that it's selling...

27
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:38,890
Najimi?

28
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,450
Najimi!

29
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,860
Yeah.

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,560
You're being absent minded.

31
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,530
Ah, you were thinking
about perverted things again...

32
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,670
Yeah...

33
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,530
No, there's no way!

34
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,770
Look, it was something
that happened all of a sudden...

35
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,040
It's like, yeah...

36
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,640
It's going well, so it's okay I think.

37
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,110
Well, it is, but yeah...

38
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,910
Hey, you and Justice...

39
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,850
Haven't you had a chance to become
a professional and debut before?

40
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,850
I have.

41
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,550
What?

42
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,290
Yeah, a couple of times.

43
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,490
Then, why haven't you debuted?

44
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,530
Such a waste.

45
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,660
Well, I like working
at my own pace.

46
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,960
Yeah...

47
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,560
For me, what I'm
pouring my passion into...

48
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,770
...isn't accepted by many magazines.

49
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,110
For example, like this.

50
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,210
It's totally erotic!

51
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,250
Or like this.

52
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,680
Wow, there are morals, you know...

53
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,050
This kind of line is said...

54
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,610
That's seriously going way too far...

55
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,190
But I think you should
grab this chance that you have.

56
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,060
That's right. If it's you, it'll go well.

57
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,090
Najimi, as long as you're happy,
I'm happy for you too.

58
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,100
Well, you never know.

59
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,160
I don't want it to be a letdown
if I get my hopes up too much.

60
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,670
That's right. There's no way 100
copies will sell out in three days.

61
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,610
Watch!

62
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,810
We'll sell off 100 copies easily and
go straight down professional way!

63
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:15,320
Then live in, like, a designer apartment
and have a driver with a Rolls-Cabbage?

64
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,050
Rolls-Royce.

65
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:21,920
Ride on a Rolls-Royce and
say good-bye to trains like this!

66
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,560
12th Edition
I still want to do it, I want to do it more.

67
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,570
Wow, they really are selling it.

68
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,930
And somewhere where
it stands out that much.

69
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,670
But...

70
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,970
It's not selling...

71
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,840
Well, of course.

72
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,070
It's the first days,
so I don't have to worry so much.

73
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,240
Go buy one.

74
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:42,980
Myself?

75
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,050
Yourself.

76
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,410
Well, that's sort of, cheating...

77
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,420
If you miss this chance, your road
to success might be closed for life.

78
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,490
W-What are you saying?

79
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,000
You're going to ride
a Rolls-Royce, right?

80
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,740
Welcome. Is this all?

81
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,930
Y-Yes...

82
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,610
Why did you dress like that anyway?

83
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:14,110
You don't want your fellow employee
seeing you buying your own book.

84
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,050
No one is going to know
that it's the book you made.

85
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,520
Even if you say that,
it's an erotic book.

86
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,160
You were the one that made it.

87
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,450
Shut up!

88
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,290
Excuse me...

89
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,950
Yes?

90
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,780
You were off today, right, Najimi-san?

91
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,560
No, no, I heard from Hoshi-kun.

92
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,030
I hope it sells!

93
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:33,960
Yes...

94
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,390
They knew...

95
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,990
Thank you very much!

96
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,470
Hey, Najimi-san.

97
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,180
Please be happy.

98
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,970
Yesterday, two copies sold.

99
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,380
Really?

100
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,880
Well, to tell you the honest truth...

101
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,180
...I got worried yesterday
and bought a copy myself.

102
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,950
Eh? You did?

103
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,080
I was worried that not even
one copy was going to sell...

104
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,950
I guess I got worried for nothing.

105
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,920
Yeah.

106
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,190
Then, please keep up the good work.

107
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,320
Ah, yes!

108
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,770
Two copies with
just you and herself.

109
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,030
Speaking of, why didn't
you guys buy for me?

110
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,010
I'm not old enough to buy.

111
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,570
I was given a copy from you.

112
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,580
Just 'cause.

113
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,080
Cold-hearted beings!

114
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,320
What about you, Nido-san?

115
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,820
What, you're sticking out your
tongue in this 21st century era?

116
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,820
Are you still jealous about it?

117
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,980
Can't you just cheer me on?

118
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,730
No, it's not jealousy!

119
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,060
Then, what is it!

120
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,000
You don't really want to
debut as a professional!

121
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,660
What a novel theory.

122
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,730
You're right.

123
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,100
That's not true!

124
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,430
It is true!

125
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,530
There is no way you
would know how I feel!

126
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,470
I know!

127
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,700
No you don't!

128
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,240
I know!

129
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,740
Kaneru-chan...

130
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,310
Stupid!

131
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,320
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

132
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,250
Stupid, stupid, stupid!
I get it, I get it!

133
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,980
Stupid!

134
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,490
Today is the fated day.

135
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,800
How about this?

136
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,230
It's a limited sale that ends today!

137
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,810
It's totally erotic!

138
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,740
It's my recommendation!

139
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,440
I know you have good intentions, but
you're making it harder for them to buy.

140
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,480
You're right...

141
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,480
Hey...

142
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,320
Can I get this?

143
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,280
Welcome.

144
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,960
That's...

145
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:39,960
Nido-san.

146
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,660
Wow, you have a great eye!

147
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,860
This artist is named
Beauty Love-sensei and...

148
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,930
...right now her stuff is only
being sold in select places, but...

149
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,340
Isn't that Justice-san?

150
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,370
It's Justice!

151
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,500
You're right.

152
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,700
He's buying that.

153
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,380
Then I'm also going to!

154
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,640
Thank you very much!

155
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,380
You sold out like a dream.

156
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,640
T-Thank you very much.

157
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,390
But I got the result by email,
so I didn't get the full effect of it...

158
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,390
It really did sell, Najimi-san.

159
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,960
But I heard that it was because
Justice was buying it, so everyone else did.

160
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,930
So it's kind of different...

161
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,630
Hey, hey, you're going to debut now...

162
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,640
That's right, what
am I looking back for?

163
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,400
Then, please let me
see your manuscript.

164
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,470
Right.

165
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,140
It was the first time
without eroticism, so...

166
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,950
...it felt really fresh.

167
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,120
I-I feel like my lifeline
is going to shrink with this...

168
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,230
Ah, it's good.

169
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,820
It's done very well.

170
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,620
You did it!

171
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,930
So please look through the
contract and stamp the seal here.

172
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,660
This is our company's rule.

173
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,060
Ah, yes.

174
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,900
What is it...

175
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,400
Well, it's written there...

176
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,110
Because you're becoming a pro...

177
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,410
...from now on, we can't
have you do any dojin work.

178
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,880
I'll make you feel better.

179
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,750
Najimi, as long as you're happy,
I'm happy for you too.

180
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,860
You're going far away!

181
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,620
Najimi-san, you're going
somewhere too far way!

182
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,820
What's wrong?

183
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,260
Najimi-san?

184
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,890
Um, I think dreams should be...

185
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,130
Bah-bam!

186
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,460
Is how you go for it.

187
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,100
Congratulations on your debut.

188
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,110
Good-bye.

189
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,070
Wait up!

190
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,370
Najimi!

191
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,440
Hey! Let me think about it more!

192
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,420
What is there to think about?

193
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,490
It's professional!
Isn't this what you wished for?

194
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,490
That might be true, but...

195
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,230
I still want to have
embarrassing experiences like...

196
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,230
Secretly buying erotic
games at the store...

197
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:02,190
Seeing my friend after that and
having a really awkward moment...

198
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,470
I still want to slowly draw
manga with my really bad skills!

199
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,040
Swaying in a crowded
train with not enough sleep...

200
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,180
Alternating between hope
and fear with little profit...

201
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,310
And handing my book to
each and every customer!

202
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,580
That's stupid!

203
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,950
Yeah, I know it's stupid.

204
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,820
But, I still want to do it.

205
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,120
Well said, Najimi.

206
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,560
Brother!

207
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,230
It's you. Perfect timing.

208
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,870
Please hold off the one
that's not understanding.

209
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,800
Okay.

210
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,740
See you.

211
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,580
No, idiot! Not me!

212
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,210
You were the one that
said let's use that girl!

213
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,010
I'm sorry. There was
something wrong with me.

214
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,440
The manuscripts...

215
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,610
Leave it up to me, kuma.

216
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,750
Nido-san.

217
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,890
I am Aioros, a brave fighter, kuma!

218
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,490
I don't like disputes, kuma!

219
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,360
Hoshi-kun!

220
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,090
Oh, no!

221
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,470
H-He's going to get me!

222
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,800
Construction?

223
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,040
Brother, take this!

224
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,750
Jump to the left?

225
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,820
You couldn't seal it on your own?

226
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,830
Even if your mouth was saying
what you said, your body is honest...

227
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,590
Hoshi-kun, I'm sorry about
giving up the chance you gave me.

228
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,360
What are you saying?

229
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,970
Najimi-san, you've
sold out twice already.

230
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,300
Isn't that amazing alone?

231
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,100
That's right...

232
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,010
When you put it that way, that's true.

233
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,180
Welcome home, Najimi-san.

234
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,580
Yeah, I'm together
with everyone again!

235
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,550
This is the application form
for the next Comic Fest.

236
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,090
The deadline is tomorrow.

237
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,310
Of course!

238
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,390
Najimi looks so happy.

239
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,630
What am I supposed to tell my boss...

240
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,470
I'm sorry. To be honest,
I like Takamura-kun...

241
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,630
Shiho?

242
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,100
So that's... Takamura!

243
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,070
Takamura-kun...

244
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,170
Nishitani, I like you...

245
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,210
Are you stupid? Too nice!

246
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,110
Shut up! Don't say that to me.

247
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,580
So far from quickly becoming rich...

248
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:42,320
...but I, Najimi Osana, for my friends
and rivals, and also for the fans...

249
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,160
No, no, for myself...

250
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,030
I came back to this place...

251
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,630
That's right...

252
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:52,570
Dreams aren't things that
should come true that easily.

253
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,710
Probably.

254
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,310
But, God, after a little time has gone by,
please give me another chance.

255
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,740
Until then, I'll work hard.

256
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,350
Because even if it's bad, it's a lot of fun.

257
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,110
And that's my...

258
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,810
...Dojin Work!

259
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,470
Mysterious.

260
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,010
Before one knows...

261
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,810
If you take your first step...

262
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,950
Completely, totally unexpectedly...

263
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,890
...you start liking things
that you don't like.

264
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:49,390
My true self wakes up?

265
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:56,830
Mu, fu, fu, maybe it's a charm.

266
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:01,000
Run through life in one line.

267
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,110
The sky is pink.

268
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:09,140
Bloomers just fly by.

269
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,080
Area of no experience.

270
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,710
Let's move on!

271
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,650
Happy smiling!

272
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,550
The dreaming maiden is sui sui chao!

273
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,360
Even the steep places breaststroke.

274
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,860
Let tomorrow be
the polka-dot pattern.

275
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,510
So let's do our best!
