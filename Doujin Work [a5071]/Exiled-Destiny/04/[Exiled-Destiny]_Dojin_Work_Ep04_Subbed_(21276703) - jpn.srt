1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,660
I did it!

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:04,700
I sold a copy of
the manga I drew, yeah!

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,670
If it comes to this now,
I'm going to draw more and more!

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,400
What, even though
you have 29 copies in stock?

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:16,130
But to be honest,
the printing cost is tremendous.

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,310
You're always wearing
really cute clothes.

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,940
Justice makes them for me.

8
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,530
Chance to get up!

9
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,130
Just decide.

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,560
Chance to get dream!

11
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,230
Just decide.

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,470
Pushing?

13
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,740
Pulling?

14
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,300
Strategy! What to do?

15
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,910
Oh, what a night! (It won't get done.)
It won't stop.

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,980
Dream and delusion rampage battle!

17
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,450
The dazzling world.

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,960
That's a life encounter.

19
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,690
I can't? But I want to see.

20
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,930
But more and more
heart throbbing, heart throbbing...

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,030
...heart throbbing, heart throbbing
is what you get, right?

22
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,230
Why not! Why not! Why not! Why not!

23
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,780
Friendship that'll last a lifetime!

24
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,980
It's not like a hero,
but you feel something.

25
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,750
You, me, who? This, that?
Him, anyone's okay!

26
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,150
Anywhere it is!

27
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:41,290
If you're with everyone, it's the best!

28
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,360
Chance to get up!

29
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,100
Just decide.

30
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,700
Chance to get dream!

31
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,300
Just decide.

32
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,000
Dojin Work

33
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,220
So can I ask about now?

34
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,010
What is it?

35
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,320
Why aren't you saying hello to Najimi?

36
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,580
Because we're following her.

37
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,090
If you could explain
in a way I can understand...

38
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,520
A job?

39
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,690
Ah, no, no. Thanks, though.

40
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,630
You were saying how you
needed to make money for printing.

41
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,200
To tell the truth, I already found one.

42
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,690
What kind of job?

43
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,370
That's...

44
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,700
...a secret!

45
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,610
4th Edition
Please stop, Master.

46
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,210
I get it.

47
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,980
That definitely makes me curious too.

48
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,450
That's why we're going to follow her
and find out where her new job is.

49
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,290
Roger!

50
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,350
But is it okay?

51
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,760
It's fine. She's just
a little shy about it, and...

52
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,160
...the truth is she seemed
like she wanted to say it.

53
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,360
On top of that...

54
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,090
Najimi is an M.

55
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,570
M?

56
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,470
M?
I get it!

57
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,270
If it's a job that she's
embarrassed to say...

58
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,670
...when people find out,
it turns into pleasure.

59
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,570
Bingo.

60
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,340
Although, if she's selling herself when
she's not supposed to be selling it...

61
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,410
Again?

62
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,540
You were the one that was just
misunderstanding the other day, Justice.

63
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,550
I cleared it up for you, right?

64
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,710
No, with the happiness
of selling one book...

65
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,780
...Najimi has been possessed
by the fascination of dojin.

66
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,230
As it is weakening
her ethical decisions...

67
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,660
...then it could be possible
that she chose that kind of job.

68
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,160
That's when I, Justice, will...

69
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,160
...bring her back to the right path!

70
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,650
I thought you would have
waited for me at the platform.

71
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,650
We would have lost Najimi.

72
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,020
More like, you and Najimi are a little alike.

73
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,350
Thank you very much.

74
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,690
I'm not speaking well of you.
But how did you know we were here?

75
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,560
It's thanks to these marks.

76
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,700
Beads?

77
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,390
You placed these on the ground
as you walked, right, Sora?

78
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,670
Yeah.

79
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,140
Thank you, Sora!

80
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,570
Justice!

81
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,210
I'm just going to go ahead.

82
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,940
Oh, bummer...

83
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,610
It looks like she just came to buy
some games or erotic books again.

84
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,110
This is strange.

85
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,990
From what I've heard,
it's about time for her job to start.

86
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,620
You think she skipped it?

87
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,860
Najimi even tried to pick up a
1-yen coin that was dropped in a puddle.

88
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,450
There's no way she would
do such a wasteful thing.

89
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,230
Then, she has to be
an employee here.

90
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,530
If that's so, it's strange
that she's hiding it.

91
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,740
Cat Ears Café.

92
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,610
Welcome home, Master...

93
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,940
I-I'm home...

94
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,510
What did you guys come here for!

95
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,150
This is not a Tsundere Café.

96
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,380
This is not a Tsundere Café.
How do I say this...

97
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,690
It's like a broad interpretation
of a sensitive part of a girl's heart.

98
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,550
You followed me, huh?

99
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,320
Well, I guess that's what
it's turned out to be.

100
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,660
It's not "I guess"!

101
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,790
It's...

102
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,230
I'm sorry.

103
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,270
It's okay. We aren't
worried about it at all!

104
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,170
I'm worried about it!

105
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,870
I wish I hadn't seen this.

106
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,570
You...

107
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,480
Luna-chan!

108
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:18,980
Yes!

109
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,140
Luna-chan?

110
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,980
Stop being so loud!

111
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,140
What's wrong?

112
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,980
No, it's nothing.

113
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,150
Najimi, that was not nothing!

114
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,490
Luna? What is Luna?

115
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,690
Master, it's making things difficult for
me, so would you be please be quiet?

116
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,100
Just for your information, the reason
why I'm working here is because...

117
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,040
You like those kinds of clothes?

118
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,160
Sora.

119
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,500
Listen, at times like this,
even if that's what you think...

120
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,920
To make money for printing, you
chose a place with a good wage, right?

121
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,080
Yes, but could you please hide that...

122
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,520
..."I'm being told to say this"
feeling a little bit more?

123
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,820
On top of that, the reason why
I'm working here is because...

124
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,190
I give up.

125
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,530
Okay, two coffees and
a rice omelet. No problem.

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,260
But the truth is she wanted to
wear those kinds of clothes, right?

127
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,010
Well, there were most likely
other places with good wages too.

128
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,530
Ah, meaning Najimi is
a very shy person, right?

129
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,510
Very shy person...

130
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,970
That's a dirty play.

131
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,650
Welcome home, Master!

132
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,150
I-I'm home...

133
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,490
One person in non-smoking, right?

134
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,150
Yes. Thank you.

135
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,490
If I'm right, that guy is...

136
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,170
The first customer of Najimi's book.

137
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,500
Najimi, may I have a moment?

138
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,670
What is it?

139
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,730
It seems like you're used to it,
but does that guy come often?

140
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,670
Hoshi-kun?

141
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,080
Yeah, every day.

142
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,510
Every day?

143
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,110
Yeah, a couple of times a day.

144
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,650
Seems like he started working
on the floor above here.

145
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,850
So he comes here
every break he gets.

146
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,980
When did he start working?

147
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,460
Maybe about two days after
I started working here, I think.

148
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,520
Luna-chan!

149
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,360
Yes, be right there!

150
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,960
That's what it is...

151
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,760
It's hard to believe that their jobs
were in the same place by chance.

152
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,370
Sorry to keep you waiting.

153
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,910
Yeah, rice omelet!

154
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,880
I can write an illustration or message
with the ketchup. What would you like?

155
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,110
The illustration is, you know,
so a message please.

156
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,040
Then what message
do you want me to write?

157
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,850
What should I do?

158
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,650
Tsuyuri, you can decide.

159
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,320
Let's do...

160
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,660
Najimi Osana is...

161
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,190
Najimi is...

162
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,490
Yes, and then?

163
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,500
A perverted girl.

164
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,990
Wait, why do I have to
write about myself like that!

165
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,800
About yourself?

166
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,810
I thought you were Luna-san, right?

167
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,170
Okay, I'll write it.

168
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,210
A perverted girl...

169
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,790
On top of that, a super masochist.

170
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,790
That's your ulterior motive?

171
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,190
Ah, hurry up and eat and go home!

172
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,280
By all means, this is not a Tsundere Café.
She's definitely tsundere!

173
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,890
Justice, you want some too?

174
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,560
I can write a message or do
an illustration with chocolate, but...

175
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,270
...what would you like?

176
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,970
W-Well, if it's... if it's okay with you...

177
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,240
If I could ask your real name...

178
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:43,340
But I can't do such a drastic thing...

179
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,280
What? I'm sorry.
I can't really hear you.

180
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,020
Don't flatter yourself, kid!

181
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,680
Oh my god, you scared me!

182
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,790
I was just requesting
a message from Luna-san.

183
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,760
More like, what's with you!

184
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,030
I am her childhood friend!

185
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,020
That's unfair!

186
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,300
I have even taken a bath
together with her.

187
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,270
Hey! Put "when we were
still young" at the end!

188
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:17,180
W-Well, I can put a
magic spell on Luna-san!

189
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,550
A magic spell?

190
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,250
Luna-san, can I get the service
for the melting-away magic?

191
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,260
C-Certainly.

192
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,260
Um, he can get a souvenir photo
taken with just the two of them.

193
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,200
Puni puni, puni puru,
it's melting-away magic, meow!

194
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,410
If you have something you want
to say, say it! Actually, don't say it.

195
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,680
Get a little closer, please.

196
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,780
What is with this sense of defeat?

197
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,120
I'll take care of this.

198
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,130
Okay, kitty!

199
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,230
You said your name was Hoshi-kun, right?
I'm heading out before you.

200
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,770
We'll meet again somewhere.

201
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,900
Is that so? I'll be here every day,
so whenever you would like.

202
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,830
Every day?

203
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,080
Do you hear me? From this day on,
you should stop chasing her around!

204
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,150
Chasing her around? How rude!

205
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,710
Najimi is most likely annoyed!

206
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,310
Is that right?

207
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,790
Beauty Love-san's real name
is Najimi-san, huh?

208
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,550
What a wonderful name.

209
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,790
This is what you call losing
the game but winning the match.

210
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,160
Well, goodbye.

211
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,170
See you another time, Najimi-san.

212
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,170
Thank you very much.

213
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,170
Najimi! You have to quit
this place right now!

214
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,810
I will not allow you to
go marry a man like him!

215
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,250
What are you talking about?

216
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,450
The reason why I'm
working here is because...

217
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,820
...if I go upstairs,
there are a lot of references.

218
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,850
I-If I know what kind
of book is selling, then...

219
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,420
...I can research what kind
of book people want.

220
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,300
So that means...

221
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,130
That's right! I thought it would be a
good environment to draw dojinshi!

222
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,640
So I won't quit!

223
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,170
So you could draw dojin...

224
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,970
Najimi!

225
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,870
It wasn't just the clothes, huh?

226
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,540
But if it was that, you should have
just worked upstairs normally.

227
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,670
Don't come see me too much.

228
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,610
It's a little embarrassing
to see acquaintances.

229
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:37,290
Okay, we'll stop coming to see you.

230
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,730
We won't come see you,
but we will come work.

231
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,590
Where's the manager!

232
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,560
We'll have them hire us right now.

233
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,760
S-Stop it!

234
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,670
Najimi, get out of the way.

235
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,240
Don't come into the kitchen!

236
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,260
Don't come into the kitchen!
There is something I have to do!

237
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,910
Thank you very much.

238
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,510
We'll be waiting at the Akiba's Tora.

239
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,530
Mysterious.

240
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,070
Before one knows...

241
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,870
If you take your first step...

242
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,000
Completely, totally unexpectedly...

243
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,940
...you start liking things
that you don't like.

244
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,450
My true self wakes up?

245
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,890
Mu, fu, fu, maybe it's a charm.

246
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,060
Run through life in one line.

247
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,170
The sky is pink.

248
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,200
Bloomers just fly by.

249
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,140
Area of no experience.

250
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,770
Let's move on!

251
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,710
Happy smiling!

252
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:11,610
The dreaming maiden is sui sui chao!

253
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,420
Even the steep places breaststroke.

254
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,920
Let tomorrow be
the polka-dot pattern.

255
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,560
So let's do our best!

256
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,800
Did you find out about the
cruel tease in the subtitles?

257
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,440
5th Edition
Let's do it with the two of us.

258
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,850
5th Edition
Let's do it with the two of us.
Please be fooled by it a little longer.

259
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,940
5th Edition
Let's do it with the two of us.
