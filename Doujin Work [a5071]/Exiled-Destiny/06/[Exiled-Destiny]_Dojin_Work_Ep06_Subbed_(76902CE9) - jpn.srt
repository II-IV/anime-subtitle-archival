1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,790
Last episode!

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,590
The rival that finally
showed up in front of me.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,060
I'm Kaneru Nido.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,930
Kaneru and I...

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,840
Whose dojinshi is going to sell?

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,760
A one-on-one female battle
with our spirit and pride on the line!

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,370
Let's stop!

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,500
No, I won't!

9
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,540
Which one did the
maiden of victory smile for?

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,140
Looking forward to it!

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,080
You're so mean...

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,980
The result is finally about to come up!

13
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,530
Chance to get up!

14
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,130
Just decide.

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,560
Chance to get dream!

16
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,230
Just decide.

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,470
Pushing?

18
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,740
Pulling?

19
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,300
Strategy! What to do?

20
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,920
Oh, what a night! (It won't get done.)
It won't stop.

21
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,990
Dream and delusion rampage battle!

22
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,460
The dazzling world.

23
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,960
That's a life encounter.

24
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,690
I can't? But I want to see.

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,930
But more and more
heart throbbing, heart throbbing...

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,030
...heart throbbing, heart throbbing
is what you get, right?

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,240
Why not! Why not! Why not! Why not!

28
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,780
Friendship that'll last a lifetime!

29
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,980
It's not like a hero,
but you feel something.

30
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,750
You, me, who? This, that?
Him, anyone's okay!

31
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,150
Anywhere it is!

32
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:43,290
If you're with everyone, it's the best!

33
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,370
Chance to get up!

34
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,100
Just decide.

35
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,700
Chance to get dream!

36
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,300
Just decide.

37
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,000
Dojin Work

38
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,350
You're not going to ask why
I'm in such a good mood?

39
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,820
Why are you in such a good mood?

40
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,220
You noticed?

41
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,620
You made me notice.

42
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,620
I won! I won!

43
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,860
Columbian Horned Frog

44
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,130
Is it like a Columbian
horned frog or something?

45
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,530
Not a pet! I'm saying I won a battle!

46
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,900
Even though you say you won,
you only sold one copy.

47
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,600
And it was only to Hoshi-kun.

48
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,740
To tell you the honest truth,
I'm jealous that you...

49
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,680
...can be happy about
selling just one copy.

50
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,910
Well, yeah...

51
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,580
6th Edition
I'm going to take one first.

52
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,220
I'm Kaneru Nido.

53
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,580
Age 24, second year
of joining the company.

54
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,260
Pretty much a common
employee to a company.

55
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,600
I'm home.

56
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,600
When I go home, what's
waiting for me are the manga drafts.

57
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,150
Yes. In a way,
dojin artist is my side job.

58
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,620
It was something I started
because I wanted to, but...

59
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,520
To tell you the truth,
it's not that easy.

60
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,560
It's well-drawn...

61
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,770
My books aren't selling,
but I have to live strong.

62
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,110
So that's when Tsuyuri said to me...

63
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,980
"It's too early to become a snob."

64
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,210
That's what she said.

65
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,190
Hey, are you listening?

66
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,620
Oh, sorry.

67
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,790
I was looking at Sora,
so I wasn't listening.

68
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,890
Gosh, Justice!

69
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,620
Poke, poke!

70
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,620
Sora!

71
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,960
Justice!

72
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,860
All is well because he is
back to the normal Justice.

73
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,660
Thanks to you.

74
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,700
I was able to give the
epic piece that I packed in...

75
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,870
...all the thoughts of my heart to him.

76
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,110
Take this!

77
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,740
Take this.

78
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,310
I wrote this manga
that might be good for you.

79
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,690
Read it and configure yourself!

80
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:28,350
Well, the reconfiguring manga that
you wrote became a waste, though.

81
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,820
Najimi, I'm going to ask
one more time, but...

82
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,390
...the reason you went into a love
hotel with him was for research, right?

83
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,960
That's exactly right.

84
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,000
But we can't let our
guard down with that guy.

85
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,700
I would like to continue to
be on high alert with him.

86
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,440
Are you still saying that?

87
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,880
Well, see you later.

88
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,350
The techniques to have
a lead on your rival...

89
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,520
This is it!

90
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,860
H-Hello, how are you?

91
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,760
T-Thank you about the other day.

92
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,670
But seriously this is a coincidence.

93
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,100
Looking for a certain book?

94
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,300
Yes, "The techniques to
have a lead on your rival."

95
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,040
Or should I say this.

96
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,040
This?

97
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,810
Can I have it?

98
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,580
No, there's only one copy...

99
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,580
Then all the more...

100
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,880
I found it first.

101
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,520
Please! I looked around for it
everywhere and finally found it!

102
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,220
Even though you say that...

103
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:37,290
Come on, you won the other day!

104
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,990
Well, even though you say I won...

105
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,040
Rock, paper, scissors!

106
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,760
Rock, paper, scissors?

107
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,770
I'm going to put a rock out.

108
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:45,140
What? Hey!

109
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,270
What? Hey!
Rock, paper, scissors...

110
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,770
...shoot!

111
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,240
You're mean...

112
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,410
First off, choosing with
"rock, paper, scissors" is nonsense!

113
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,980
What's the matter, Najimi?

114
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,480
How embarrassing.

115
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,520
Why are you raising
your voice in a bookstore?

116
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,060
It's not my fault! She was...

117
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,060
And she is?

118
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,290
It's the girl competing against Najimi!

119
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,020
Um, we aren't competing or anything.

120
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:16,300
I see. You compete on how many copies
you sell and you boost each other up.

121
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,040
What a good relationship.

122
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,210
Thank you.

123
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,970
I'm Kaneru Nido.

124
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,770
Normally, I'm a company employee.

125
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,540
A company employee?

126
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,210
Is there something wrong?

127
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,040
Oh, no...

128
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,910
I'm Najimi Osana.

129
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,540
This is Justice.

130
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,120
And she is...

131
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,020
Justice of the major company?

132
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,690
Oh, you know me? What a pleasure.

133
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,690
I'm a big fan!

134
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,670
I'm Sora!

135
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,260
I always buy your books.

136
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:53,070
I cried so much with
the epic 500-page piece!

137
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,200
On top of that, on top of that...

138
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:57,980
I...

139
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,680
Thank you very much.

140
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,140
No!

141
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,940
Kaneru-san...

142
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,550
I guess I'll let you
have this book after all.

143
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:09,660
Really?

144
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,290
I'm going to have Justice
teach me how to draw.

145
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,430
From me?

146
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,930
From Justice-san?

147
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,430
Come on, as a
childhood friend's side benefit.

148
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,990
Lucky...

149
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,800
Well, I don't mind, but...

150
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,430
Me too, me too!

151
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,360
I want him to teach me too.

152
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,200
That's not possible at all.

153
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,870
If it's fine with me, I would love to.

154
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,910
Goody!

155
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,670
Hey! What are you saying okay for!

156
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,340
Why not, Najimi?

157
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,080
If you compete with
the same requirements...

158
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,620
...then you'd be able to compare
each other's strength, don't you think?

159
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,450
That might be true, but...

160
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,390
Well okay, I'm going to
show her my seriousness!

161
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,630
It's supposed to be here.

162
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,940
She's not here when
she's supposed to be.

163
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,800
Come on, let's leave!

164
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,510
Good morning.

165
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,110
Welcome.

166
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,300
Come in.

167
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,350
Thank you!

168
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,040
Those are cute pajamas.

169
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,410
The stuffed animal too!

170
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,080
I am Aioros the bear.

171
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,950
A brave warrior...

172
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,160
I'm a bear that doesn't like conflict.

173
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,850
Thanks in advance.

174
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,550
No, that's our line.

175
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,890
I'm so sorry for being half-awake.

176
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,330
I didn't say anything weird, did I?

177
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,100
Yes, of course.

178
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,090
I can't believe you said
such a vulgar thing like that.

179
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,370
Tsuyuri, stop it.

180
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,840
She's my friend Tsuyuri.
She writes dojinshi also.

181
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,370
Nice to meet you.

182
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,770
I heard you're competing
on your sales with Najimi.

183
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,140
Ah, no, it's not like that.

184
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:47,290
I will cheer you on because for me,
it would be more interesting if you win!

185
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,620
Please do your best!

186
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,780
Thank you!

187
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,750
Y-You...

188
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,020
This is...

189
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,060
If you stare at it too long,
your lifeline is going to get shorter.

190
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,760
What kind of drawing is that!

191
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,130
How is it?

192
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,500
Is there hope in my drawing?

193
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,200
Well, this is a common aspect to
the both of you, but you don't have...

194
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,010
...enough sense to make your
drawing more three-dimensional.

195
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:13,800
The drawing to be...

196
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,470
...three-dimensional.

197
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,250
That's new.

198
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,120
O-Okay...

199
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,990
Then let's actually draw it.

200
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:29,560
Just like this, as you make
a dimension in your paper...

201
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,250
Amazing!

202
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,730
I see.

203
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,400
Did you get it?

204
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,070
Then I'll give you advice
as you work on each page.

205
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,040
As I thought, living alone is nice.

206
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,150
N-No, not really...

207
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,510
Oh, I know!

208
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,950
If you live at your parent's house,
there's something I want you to have.

209
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,360
I was given this
from someone at work.

210
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,660
A Columbian horned frog!

211
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,090
I didn't think I was really
going to have one as a pet.

212
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,600
I don't want it! I don't
want it! I don't want it!

213
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,010
But, you can't have pets here...

214
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,840
...and at my house lives Aioros!

215
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,230
I don't care about such a thing!

216
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,840
Why don't you take it, Justice?

217
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,740
I had the harlequin snake
Guilty at my house just let out.

218
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,980
It's going to be eaten!

219
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,250
Then, Tsuyuri!

220
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,980
A frog skin bag.

221
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,330
You can't do that!

222
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,560
I'll take it!

223
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,820
Thank you so much!

224
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,800
Oh, I'll bring some tea or something.

225
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,790
Oh no, don't worry about it.

226
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,660
The tea that I made has a reputation
of being really good at work.

227
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,870
Amazing!

228
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,510
Hey, Sora-chan, you are
cute and I like you a lot!

229
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,480
Kaneru-chan, you are like
a child and cute too!

230
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,240
What? I'm not a child anymore!

231
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,810
More like you put "chan"
at the end of my name?

232
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,820
Kaneru-chan!

233
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,050
Bears...

234
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,760
Look, Aioros is right here.

235
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,760
No!

236
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,910
Baki-chan!

237
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,140
I'm really sorry...

238
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,880
I'm going to vacuum right away.

239
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,390
Ah, that feels good.

240
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,100
U-Um, I will make
some tea right away.

241
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,340
No, don't worry about it.

242
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,500
Don't change the channel!

243
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,530
Mysterious.

244
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,070
Before one knows...

245
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,870
If you take your first step...

246
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,000
Completely, totally unexpectedly...

247
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,940
...you start liking things
that you don't like.

248
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,450
My true self wakes up?

249
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,890
Mu, fu, fu, maybe it's a charm.

250
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,060
Run through life in one line.

251
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,170
The sky is pink.

252
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,200
Bloomers just fly by.

253
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,140
Area of no experience.

254
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,770
Let's move on!

255
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,710
Happy smiling!

256
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:11,610
The dreaming maiden is sui sui chao!

257
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,420
Even the steep places breaststroke.

258
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,920
Let tomorrow be
the polka-dot pattern.

259
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,560
So let's do our best!

260
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,830
It's already the halfway point.

261
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,440
I can hear everyone's voice
of being disappointed.

262
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,570
Those that didn't say it,
say it right now.

263
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,050
7th Edition
How wonderful the smell of BaLa.
