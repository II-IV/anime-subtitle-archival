[Hitohito] <i>All right, then.
What should I get for her in return?</i>

22

Hmm.

24

<i>Whoa! Each of those things
has a different meaning.</i>

25
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:14,115
<i>Candy means you like them,
marshmallows mean you hate them,</i>

26
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,409
<i>and cookies means you're friends.</i>

27
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,078
Hmm.

28
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,331

<i>Nah.</i>

<i>Nah... Yeah--</i>

34
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,426
You're ruining my concentration!

35
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,719
Um, actually,

36
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,139
I'm having a hard time deciding
what to get a friend for White Day.

37
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,517
This is about White Day?

38
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,686
Are you talking about those chocolates
you got from your guy friend?

39
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:44,729
Yes! That's right!

40
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,814
Yes, that's it!

41
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,440
What's gotten into you?

42
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,568
Well, if you wanna give him something
for the chocolates he gave you,

43
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,403
how about giving him some food?

44
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,905
Chocolate would be good too.

45
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:55,865
Huh.

46
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:59,869
I wanted to get something more,
I'm just not sure what I should get him.

47
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,246
Do you like him?

48
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:02,997
[Hitohito] N-no!

49
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:06,125
[Hitomi gasping] <i>Judging from his reaction</i>

50
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:09,754
<i>and the fact that the shadow back there
was about 165 centimeters tall</i>

51
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,256
<i>and had a silhouette with long hair,</i>

52
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,050
<i>and the fact that those footsteps I heard
had a short stride...</i>

53
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,760
Hitohito?

54
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,513
So did you get some?

55
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,431
[Hitohito] What...
what are you talking about?

56
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,058
You've left me no choice.

57
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,810
I'll help you decide what to get.

58
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,769
[Hitohito gasping]

59
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,938
[both sighing]

60
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,064
NO CUSHION FOR ME...

61
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,650
So first, was that chocolate
"friendship chocolate"

62
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,110
or "true-love chocolate"?

63
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,822
Just friendship chocolate,
at least I think.

64
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,948
Wait. You think?

65
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,075
[Hitohito] Well, that's what they said.

66
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,829
Huh. Maybe they just said that
to avoid feeling embarrassed.

67
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,456
Maybe. I guess so.

68
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,208
[gasping] No, no, no, no, no, no!

69
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,835
I don't even think that's possible!

70
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,587
[Hitomi] Hmm.

71
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,214
If those were true-love chocolates,

72
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,509
they'd probably like it if you gave them
something they could keep for a long time.

73
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,386
- [Hitohito] I see.
- Do you like this guy?

74
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,304
[Hitohito] Huh?

75
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,471
I said it's not like that!

76
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,724
Pick one. You like them or hate them.
Which is it?

77
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,643
[gasping] In that case, I... Well...

78
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,145
<i>We're talking about Katai, right?</i>

79
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,564
I guess I like him, more or less. Why?

80
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,817
- [seething] That's not what I mean!
- What are you trying to get at?

81
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:13,902
[Hitohito gasping]

82
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,697
Picture them, brother.
Picture that person in your mind.

83
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,909
Hitohito, do you like or not?

84
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:21,826
[Hitohito] Uh...

85
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,330
Uh...

86
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,332
[Hitohito shuddering]

87
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,921
I guess I'm interested in them.

88
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,423
- [Hitomi] Huh?
- [Hitohito] What are you upset about?

89
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,927
[Hitomi] I understand the situation now.

90
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:39,844
[Hitohito] Huh?

91
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,472
Let's go to the department store!

92
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,224
[Hitohito gasping] Great idea!

[opening theme music playing]

94
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,018
[Hitomi] I just watched a news show

95

about which sweets look best
on social media.

96
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,272
Great idea!

97
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,607
But, you know, Hitohito,

98
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,443
as long as it's from someone you like,
it doesn't matter what it is.

99

Don't you think? [chuckling]

100
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,949

[narrator] <i>Tadano gave a serious reply.</i>

174

Shoko's out running an errand right now.

175

I'm so sorry
that she's not here to see you.

176

[Hitohito] Huh? Oh, then I'll come back--

[Hitohito] My name is Hitohito Tadano.

198
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,002
I'm in class with Sho--

199

That is, I meant to say your daughter.

200
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,547
I study hard every day.

201
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:31,719
And... and your daughter gave me some
friendship chocolates for Valentine's Day.

202
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:35,306
[Hitohito gasping] So I've come here today

it's not the right season for it,

I don't wanna bother you
any longer, you know?

246

Especially since it's a weekend!

Whoa! She's squishing down on the eraser,

276
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,178

Well, I... I thank you so much
for all the fun I had today.

[Hitohito] I see it started raining.

402
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,007
Do you have an umbrella?

404
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,511
{\an8}Oh, good.

405
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,388
I brought mine too.

406
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,285

is only a few days away.

411
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,930
We'll be put in new classes next week.

412
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,976
I just feel sad that our time together

413
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,771
might be coming to an end.

414
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,027
I know how you feel.

[inaudible]

419
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,675
[Hitohito] First,
we made friends with Najimi

420
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,386
who says crazy things sometimes,

421
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:01,265
but I also feel Najimi was the reason
we were all able to become friends.

422
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,016
They took the lead.

423
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:04,810
[Komi grunting]

424
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:09,231
[Hitohito] After that
we made friends with Agari.

425
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,192
Going out to eat
with her was an adventure.

426
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,863
I hope we can go out to eat
with Agari again someday.

427

[Komi grunting]

428
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:22,536
[Hitohito] Yamai and Nakanaka
always act like they're fighting,

429
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,205
but I think
they actually get along pretty well.

430
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,957
[Komi grunting emphatically]

431
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,545
Onemine and Otori are so stable.

432
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,214
Being around them
just somehow puts you at ease.

433
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:38,218
I feel like both of them
are really dependable people.

435
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:44,433
I'm glad you made friends
with Kato and Sasaki on our school trip.

436
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,684
They seem nice.

438
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,772
Somehow that trip made me happy too.

439
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:57,112
It's too bad we only got to help Sato
clean our classroom before school

440
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,530
just this last month.

doing that all alone the whole year.

444
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:10,375

446
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,549
There was the school athletic festival,
a cultural festival.

447
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,177
We went shopping, to the water park.

448
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,387
We had that great Christmas party
and snowball fight!

449
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,015
And went to a shrine on New Year's
to get our fortunes.

456
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:02,427
Uh, I was going
to use the rain stopping as symbolism

457
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,846
and try to come up
with something witty to say,

458
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,391
but it was too hard.

Great idea!
