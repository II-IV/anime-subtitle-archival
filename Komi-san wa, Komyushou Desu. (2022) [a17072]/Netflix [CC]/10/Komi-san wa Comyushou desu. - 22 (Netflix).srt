[Mom] Hito-chan, what are you doing?

382
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,938
Oh. Here's chocolate for you.

383
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:06,108
[narrator] <i>Receiving chocolate from your
mother doesn't count either, of course.</i>

387
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,868
[Hitomi] Mom and I
both gave you some chocolates.

388
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,246
And you got some chocolate
from your friend too, right?

389

[Hitomi chuckling] From... from a guy?

from a guy friend.

Hitohito, go and buy some ice cream.

Huh?

397
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,312
I don't want ice cream.

398
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,522
Besides, it's cold.
You really want it now?

399
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:49,610
Just do it. These days everyone's starting
to have ice cream in the winter instead.

400
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,362
It's warm indoors,
so people feel like having some ice cream.

401
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,656
Ice cream sales numbers
are growing every year.

402
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,700
[Hitohito] What are you talking about?

403
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,243
I'm going anyway.

Komi? What...

411
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,179
[Mom] Oh, can you buy
some <i>dashi</i> on the way?

412
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,223
<i>Dashi?</i> Yeah, sure. I... I got it.

Oh, good,
because I'd hate to have hurt you.

419
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,328
So, uh... what, uh...

420
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,622
what happened, uh, at school?

421
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,957

428
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:04,768

[Najimi] Why weren't you there, Tadano?

430
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,189
[Hitohito] Uh, sorry.
Thanks for bringing this over.
