<i>Cat Killing Chapter

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,600
furimuita sono ushiro no shoumen daare?
I looked back behind me; who’s there?

3
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:53,780
kurayami ni tsume wo tatete yoru wo hikisaita
In the pitch dark, I raised my claws and slashed apart the night.

4
00:00:53,780 --> 00:01:03,550
amadare wa chi no shizuku to natte hoho wo tsutai ochiru
The raindrops turn into droplets of blood and travel down my cheeks.

5
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:13,550
mou doko ni mo kaeru basho ga nai nara
If there’s no place for me to return to anymore...

6
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,260
kono yubi tomare watashi no yubi ni
Take these fingers, my fingers...

7
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,470
sono yubi goto tsuretette ageru
I’ll take you away with that finger.

8
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:27,380
higurashi ga naku akazu no mori e
To the sealed forest where cicadas cry...

9
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:34,600
atomodori wa mou dekinai
I can’t turn back anymore.

10
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,760
Kei-chan.

11
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,000
Since you have less than ten coins...

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,960
...if someone now bets the max of ten coins...

13
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,000
...it means you will automatically have to fold.

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,520
In other words...

15
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,110
...no matter how good your hand is...

16
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:01,010
...we can bring you down by force.

17
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,140
Keiichi?

18
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:10,030
Today's punishment game is a grand march around the village wearing pretty clothes.

19
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:15,120
So I'm sure Keiichi will end up being forced to wear school swimsuits, garter belts...

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,530
...corsets and maid outfits!

21
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,150
<i>Bingo!

22
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,270
<i>A three of a kind and a joker!

23
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,210
<i>That means a four of a kind!

24
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,550
You'll be forced to parade around the village...

25
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,300
...while blushing and fidgeting awkwardly!

26
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,910
Rena.

27
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,640
The amount you won from me just now...

28
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,500
Could you lend me around ten coins of it...?

29
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,780
I won't.

30
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,840
A battle is ruthless.

31
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,880
Damn...

32
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,600
It takes a true club member to turn the game around at this point!

33
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,780
You understand very well.

34
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,600
But what are you planning to do?

35
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,800
I-I...

36
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,690
To make up for the coins I'm short...

37
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,860
...I'm thinking of betting something other than coins.

38
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,160
How about it?

39
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,530
Do you accept that?

40
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,520
I figured you'd suggest this.

41
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,470
So?

42
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,960
What will you bet in exchange for the amount you're short?

43
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:16,540
I'll wear a school swimsuit, a garter belt and a miniskirt maid outfit for you...

44
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,310
...and allow you to take me home!

45
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,430
And how about I clean your ears as well!?

46
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,710
I like it, Kei-chan!

47
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,470
The guts to bet your body for the amount you're short.

48
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,470
I like it!

49
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,480
Somehow Mii's face is bright red.

50
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,430
I'm sure she's imagining being alone in her room with Keiichi...

51
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,480
- Is this the spot, Mion?

52
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,940
- Yes, right there!

53
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,230
...with her head pillowed on his lap, blushing and squealing!

54
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,480
- Does it feel good?

55
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,780
- It's amazing...

56
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,360
I-I-I'm not thinking about that!

57
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,500
A-As club president...

58
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,990
...I'm just genuinely enjoying this game!

59
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,250
If it means I can take Keiichi-kun home, I won't lose!

60
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,980
So how about it?

61
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,760
Is this enough of a substitute for the coins I'm short?

62
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,620
It's plenty.

63
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,180
More than plenty.

64
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,090
You don't need to pay any coins.

65
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,770
Having you clean our ears while we pillow our heads on your lap is worth ten coins.

66
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,430
All right!

67
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,460
So the game is on, right?

68
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,770
Don't be too shocked when you see my cards!

69
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,780
Get a load of this!

70
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,280
Four of a kind!

71
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:34,230
Looks like the goddess of victory fell in love with me!

72
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,440
Let's move on!

73
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,420
I want to play, but...

74
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,710
All right!

75
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,480
In that case, if I lose next time, I'll become an apron maid...

76
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,450
...and make the winner dinner and desserts!

77
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,260
I guess!

78
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,550
My!

79
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,270
I can't fold with this hand either.

80
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,900
In that case, I'll add ten coins...

81
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,910
...as well as the right for the winner to have me feed them lunch in an outfit of choice!

82
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,090
In that case, I'll bet ten coins...

83
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:10,280
...and add in the right to put a collar around my neck and walk me like a dog!

84
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,290
S-Seriously!?

85
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,380
This has gotten pretty interesting!

86
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,520
The spirit of betting risky stuff over coins!

87
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,630
I love it!

88
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,130
Of course you will bet something too, won't you, Mion?

89
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,110
Let's see now...

90
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,340
Then I'll dress up in whatever way the winner wants me to...

91
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,620
...and do their homework for them.

92
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,470
Well?

93
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:39,420
Having Mion-san do my math drills isn't too bad.

94
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,190
No!

95
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,690
I will win and take all of you home!

96
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,730
Shut up, shut up!

97
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,960
I will win!

98
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,730
And then I'll enslave everyone and have them do this and that for me...

99
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,450
Keiichi, your drool is overflowing.

100
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,960
The battle is on!

101
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,960
Huh?

102
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,990
<i>In the end...

103
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,050
<i>...everyone kept winning and losing at the game...

104
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:20,250
<i>...until all of us ended up having to walk around the village cosplaying.

105
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,400
What was that game about?

106
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,270
There was no single winner...

107
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,430
...so everyone just ended up being the loser?

108
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,000
Fighting brings forth nothing.

109
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,930
Where do we go next?

110
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,570
Where?

111
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,330
This road leads to the Fukudaya's.

112
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,760
Or do we go that way, to Takatsudo?

113
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,010
Or Yagouchi?

114
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,000
I've never been to Yagouchi.

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,660
What kind of place is it?

116
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,520
There are no houses in Yagouchi.

117
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,250
It's a very lonesome place.

118
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,580
Then it's decided!

119
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,350
Let's go there!

120
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,290
I don't want to run into any more villagers!

121
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,930
Well, if you insist...

122
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,320
...I guess we can go check it out.

123
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,740
I feel like taking a walk.

124
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,780
All right, let's go!

125
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,660
Let's go, let's go!

126
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,370
I guess I have no choice...

127
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,480
I...

128
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,750
...think it's better if we don't go there.

129
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,640
There really is nothing here.

130
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,780
Are there people living here?

131
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,270
In the past.

132
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,140
This place has been deserted for ages.

133
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,760
There are barely any lights around here...

134
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,380
...and there are rumors about wild dogs appearing when it's pitch dark at night.

135
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,660
We should probably go back now.

136
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,450
You're right.

137
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,410
If we get lost in such ridiculous outfits...

138
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,160
...it will become an embarrassing story talked about for seven generations to come.

139
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,880
You can say that again.

140
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,670
There's nothing beyond this point anyway, is there?

141
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:11,420
There's a quarry site on the backside of that mountain.

142
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,250
A quarry?

143
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,470
It belonged to a cement company.

144
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,890
They went bankrupt quite a while ago, so it's deserted now.

145
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:23,290
A deserted quarry site deep in a lonesome mountain range?

146
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,020
That sounds pretty interesting!

147
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,830
Don't go there!

148
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:32,030
Good kids shouldn't go near the quarry.

149
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,740
That's right.

150
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:39,540
It's even written in our summer vacation guidebook not to get close to that place.

151
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:46,040
It's male instinct to want to sneak in there even more after hearing that.

152
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,780
There might just be...

153
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,620
...a mountain of treasure rivaling the size of the one at the dam site!

154
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,070
A new mountain of treasure!

155
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,050
Then I wanna go too!

156
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,440
I don't really recommend going there.

157
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,630
They say there's a pit there.

158
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,480
A pit?

159
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,770
What's that about?

160
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,510
I've heard stories about the pit as well.

161
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,570
But are they true?

162
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,110
I think it's best not to get close to the pit.

163
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,240
Mii-chan, what is this pit, I wonder?

164
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,540
Ah, right.

165
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,220
You and Kei-chan haven't heard about it, have you?

166
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,460
They say two people died there.

167
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,620
It's sort of a ghost story.

168
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,920
A ghost story?

169
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,570
I remember it as if it were yesterday.

170
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:41,590
Whenever I think it could have been me who fell into the pit...

171
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,020
...I get really scared.

172
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,050
You?

173
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,960
It was around six or seven years ago.

174
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,190
The dam war was still going strong back then.

175
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:01,450
The children were playing normally in the fields and mountains like they do now.

176
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,650
Then one day...

177
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,320
...the company owning the quarry went bankrupt.

178
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,710
The kindhearted company president was tricked...

179
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:12,130
...into accepting a position of co-signer for his employees.

180
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,640
They slipped out en masse.

181
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,960
Didn't that president commit a family suicide?

182
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:26,840
He killed his wife and young child in a prefab office at the quarry...

183
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,120
...then poured himself in kerosine and barbecued himself alive.

184
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,000
Huh?

185
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,990
But didn't Rika-chan just say that only two people died?

186
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,000
According to that story, three people died.

187
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,490
Sorry about that.

188
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,160
These three don't count for the pit story.

189
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,540
Anyway, due to this suicide...

190
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,500
...the quarry was closed down and deserted.

191
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,740
The president's vengeful apparition is still roaming about the site of the suicide...

192
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,010
...or so the rumor went.

193
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:02,510
Wouldn't such a rumor be immensely interesting to children?

194
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,510
Certainly.

195
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:09,400
And so we ended up going there.

196
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,520
You all went there?

197
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,660
I've never been there.

198
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,530
We were still really small.

199
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,530
We ended up playing kick-the-can with a can we happened to find lying around.

200
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,980
No one really paid it any mind...

201
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,700
...but there was a strange smell in the air since we entered the quarry.

202
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,790
It smells...

203
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,710
It smelled?

204
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,550
How should I put it...

205
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,240
It smelled like rotten eggs.

206
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,690
Rotten eggs...?

207
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,740
Sulfur?

208
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,560
Yes, that's it!

209
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,610
Wouldn't you normally only smell sulfur near a crater?

210
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,680
Did the smell come from the quarry?

211
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,060
No idea...

212
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,800
But the smell soon stopped bothering me.

213
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,070
We continued playing kick-the-can...

214
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,160
Found Takashi!

215
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,300
You found me!

216
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:13,650
Suddenly, some man looking like quarry personnel appeared out of nowhere...

217
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,130
...and came running in an incredibly threatening manner.

218
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,970
You fucking brats!

219
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,630
This ain't no place to be screwing around!

220
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,030
Get the fuck out of here!

221
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,160
In the end...

222
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,250
...everyone fled the site...

223
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,560
...and ended up separated.

224
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,600
What?

225
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,810
It didn't end with that, did it?

226
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,000
No.

227
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,820
What's up, Mii-chan?

228
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,810
There was one boy...

229
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,570
...who never returned home.

230
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,540
He never returned...?

231
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:55,530
After being yelled at by that man, we scattered out and went home separately, so we couldn't tell.

232
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,060
But by that time...

233
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,830
...he had probably already disappeared.

234
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,590
Does that mean...

235
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:06,730
He was hit by Oyashiro-sama's curse, and demoned away...

236
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,930
...or so people say.

237
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,080
Demoned away?

238
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,940
A ghost story of sorts here in Hinamizawa.

239
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,260
A ghost story, huh?

240
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:23,440
That boy's parents called everyone of us...

241
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:28,490
...but there wasn't a single kid that went home from the quarry with him.

242
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,950
So what happened?

243
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:36,510
His father speculated he might have gotten into an accident on his way home...

244
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,460
...so he decided to go to the quarry by car.

245
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,000
So did he find him?

246
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,190
On the contrary...

247
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,840
The father never returned either.

248
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,180
If I remember correctly...

249
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,480
...the car the father and his son were in...

250
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,070
...was found in a valley along the road from Yagouchi to Hinamizawa.

251
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,280
Such a sorrowful story.

252
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,520
He was able to find his lost child, and they were on their way home...

253
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:13,870
That's where the story gets a bit odd.

254
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,580
I remember that the scene of the accident was quite close to the quarry.

255
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,380
What's odd about it being close to the quarry?

256
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,780
Think about it...

257
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:28,460
It was already quite late when his father came searching for him by car.

258
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,390
The surroundings should have been pretty much pitch black...

259
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:36,230
It would mean that the boy stayed at the quarry all that time.

260
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,120
Perhaps he was caught by the man at the quarry...

261
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,230
...and subjected to a good tongue-lashing?

262
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,290
About that...

263
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,910
When the police investigated later...

264
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,240
...they stated there was no one at the quarry that day.

265
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,110
There's no way that's true.

266
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,250
We were most definitely chased out by an intimidating man!

267
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,500
There was definitely someone there!

268
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,400
As a result...

269
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,950
...it's said that the workman might have actually been a ghost.

270
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,930
There's no way!

271
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,340
Such massive ghosts loudly stamping their feet like that don't exist!

272
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,470
That man's true identity aside...

273
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,810
What we don't understand...

274
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:22,350
...is why that boy remained at the quarry until it was dark.

275
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:27,360
Rumor has it he might have fallen into the pit.

276
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,770
The pit?

277
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,620
We're back at that pit again...

278
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,870
Just what is it?

279
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,670
A pit!

280
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,450
And it's incredibly deep...

281
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:41,370
...reaching all the way to the realm of demons deep below the ground.

282
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,150
According to Onigafuchi folklore...

283
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,910
...there exists a demon realm deep below the village.

284
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,590
Basically, hell exists there.

285
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,050
So there might be a pit somewhere that leads to that place.

286
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,760
I see...

287
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,690
So that's what being demoned away is about.

288
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:01,780
But that boy didn't disappear, did he?

289
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,560
He met up with his father safe and sound, and got in an accident on the way back, right?

290
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,280
I mentioned earlier...

291
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,950
...that there was a strange smell in the air at the quarry that day.

292
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,230
The villager who first discovered the car...

293
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:22,100
...detected a faint smell of rotten eggs when he peeked inside the car.

294
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,830
Sulfur!

295
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:29,840
A sulfurous smell certainly isn't normal.

296
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,550
Was it called hydrogen sulfide...?

297
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,630
It's a poisonous gas with a sulfurous odor.

298
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,570
Sometimes, there are news items about laborers dying from poisoning...

299
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,480
...while cleaning liquid waste tanks in factories, right?

300
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,080
Could there have been such a tank at the quarry...

301
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,600
...which ruptured at some point, causing harmful gases to leak out?

302
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,070
Surely, things make sense if that were the case.

303
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,630
While playing kick-the-can...

304
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,920
...the boy stepped into a strange place...

305
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,800
...inhaled harmful gases emitted from the liquid waste...

306
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,740
...and collapsed on the spot.

307
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,360
And when his father arrived at the scene...

308
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,260
...he must have inhaled the harmful gases as well.

309
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,140
It all makes sense.

310
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,980
When you explain it like that...

311
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,050
...it feels like a long time mystery has been quite easily unraveled!

312
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,160
Well, God knows what actually went down.

313
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,570
But still...

314
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:29,400
...I can't help but feel that there's something concealed here that makes this not just a mere accident.

315
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,560
If this was not just a mere accident...

316
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,220
...what do you think is concealed?

317
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,450
Let's see...

318
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,650
There are a few points.

319
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,970
A worker that wasn't supposed to be there...

320
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,750
...and the reason the boy remained at the quarry until nightfall.

321
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,630
And finally, their mysterious death inside the car on their way back.

322
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:55,380
We might find out if we go to the quarry to check if there was a leakage of dangerous gases.

323
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,920
Mion.

324
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,320
You aren't thinking of going there...?

325
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,390
If that theory is correct...

326
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:05,230
...the ruins of that quarry should still be a dangerous place.

327
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,810
I don't agree with going to such a place...

328
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:09,940
...I think.

329
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,590
My interest has actually been piqued.

330
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,100
Listening to Kei-chan...

331
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,950
...I've gotten the feeling I can finally get to the truth behind this ghost story.

332
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,380
Aren't you interested?

333
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,890
Don't you want to find out the truth?

334
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,600
Some places in this world are considered taboo.

335
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,170
That's a pretty deep thing to say, Rika-chan.

336
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,970
What do you mean by that?

337
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,340
Keiichi.

338
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,130
In this world...

339
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:48,220
...where there is light, there is always shadow...

340
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,730
...and in the same way, where there are good places, there are bad ones as well.

341
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:57,900
There are instances where treading upon such places will make people miserable without reason.

342
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,740
When us humans are unable to define such dreadful places well in words...

343
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,320
...we call such places "taboo."

344
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,180
They say curiosity killed the cat.

345
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,730
If there are bad rumors about this place...

346
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,800
....it might be best not to let morbid curiosity get the better of us.

347
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,410
You're right.

348
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,810
I'm of the same opinion as Rena-san.

349
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,610
Is that so?

350
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,220
Let's go home!

351
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,330
My dad will get worried if I'm not back before nightfall.

352
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,800
Guess so.

353
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,580
If his daughter comes home late at night in such an outfit...

354
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,880
...your father might faint on the spot!

355
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:59,060
That's the same for you!

356
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,320
Oh well!

357
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,560
Let's call it a day and go home!

358
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,750
Let's go home!

359
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,060
Keiichi?

360
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,800
If I were to go explore the quarry...

361
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,570
...would I fall into that pit and be demoned away?

362
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,960
You would.

363
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,970
I see!

364
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,210
Then I guess I'd better stay away!

365
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,460
Kei-chan!

366
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,970
Aren't you seriously scared?

367
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,370
D-Don't be stupid!

368
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,710
His knees are shaking!

369
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,850
As if!

370
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,140
Hey, wait!

371
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,510
This is for the best.

372
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,240
Even if you don't seek it out yourself...

373
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,230
...the curse will come for you on its own.

374
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,000
After all...

375
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,710
...Watanagashi will soon arrive.

376
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:34,230
To get my happiness I had done everything...

377
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:41,320
...but had done nothing to be blamed and accused of.

378
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:48,320
The sound of footsteps became louder every day...

379
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:55,380
Then I noticed the fact there was no time.

380
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:03,590
I was a believer in life to be myself always...

381
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:10,490
...and was asking whether I would be alive.

382
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:17,690
Give me a reason why not to adopt in this way...

383
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:24,940
...or judge me to be guilty of so many incurable sins.

384
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:31,450
Tell me why, or why not. Complaining way too much...

385
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:38,890
...maybe I overlooked something fatal for me.

386
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:46,340
<i>One-blow Cat Killing

387
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,830
Aren't there a lot of cats around?

388
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,940
And they seem to be angry about something...

389
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,330
What could have happened to them?

390
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,460
Well, the title...

391
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,000
...you know?

392
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,110
<i>The end.
