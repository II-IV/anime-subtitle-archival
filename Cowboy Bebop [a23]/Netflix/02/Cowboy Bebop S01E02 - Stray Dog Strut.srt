1
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,305
Come out!
You can't run anymore!

2
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:48,608
- We'll shoot!
- Give up already, Abdul Hakim!

3
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,714
- So, you wanna fight?
- You're such a...

4
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,534
<i>Amigo!</i>

5
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,870
<i>How are all you 300,000 bounty hunters
in the solar system doing?</i>

6
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,574
<i>It's time for</i> Big Shot, <i>the show that
brings you information about fugitives!</i>

7
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:59,512
<i>Well, well, first up for today,
is this guy: Abdul Hakim.</i>

8
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,683
<i>He's known as a serial pet thief.</i>

9
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,552
<i>This time, he snagged a test animal</i>

10
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,954
<i>from a research facility,
and is on the loose.</i>

11
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:12,425
<i>The good news is that he's
worth a whopping 8 million!</i>

12
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,260
<i>The conditions are as always.</i>

13
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,529
<i>Bring him in alive
to collect your reward.</i>

14
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,865
<i>If you kill him,
kiss your reward goodbye.</i>

15
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:22,335
<i>He's the biggest we've had in a while.
Do your best to get this guy.</i>

16
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,269
How's it look?

17
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:24,704
It's done for.

18
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:26,973
Man, why does everything...

19
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,476
<i>Hey.</i>

20
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:31,911
Doctor? You got information?

21
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,913
<i>About Abdul Hakim.</i>

22
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:37,317
<i>- I'll take it!</i>
- I'll give a discount. 300.

23
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,285
I got his post-plastic surgery picture.

24
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:40,787
<i>Too much. 20 down.</i>

25
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:45,558
All right, 280. On one condition.

26
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,328
- What's that?
<i>- Sock him one.</i>

27
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:53,533
<i>He trampled over me.
If you want, punch him a dozen times.</i>

28
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,926
I've got the goods.

29
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,629
This one should be something big.

30
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,465
Yeah, see you in six hours.

31
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,335
<i>He had a very conspicuous suitcase.</i>

32
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,371
That info's included in the deal, right?

33
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:32,805
<i>Oh, all right.</i>

34
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,309
<i>It was something that could
carry a small woman inside.</i>

35
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,377
Treasure?

36
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,811
<i>Can't really say.</i>

37
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,714
<i>The way he handled it,
sure didn't seem that way.</i>

38
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,829
If you feel lethargic,
have a ginseng beverage.

39
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,698
You'll last a week with it!

40
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,668
If you're tired,
have a sugarcane beverage.

41
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,437
You ate too much?
Then have a pineapple beverage.

42
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,638
Give me some lao chu.

43
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:06,839
Thank you.

44
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:08,441
Here you go.

45
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,946
Sorry. My apologies, bro.

46
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,884
Hey, I said I'm sorry.

47
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,420
What, can't say anything?

48
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,858
What? You picking a fight?

49
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,595
My treat.

50
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:36,669
Drink.

51
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,596
And now, the loot.

52
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,493
Even if I overhaul this whole craft,
I'll have some change.

53
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,695
Guess I'll go eat Peking duck with it.

54
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:39,599
As they say,
"Don't count chickens before they hatch."

55
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,902
I got this one nailed shut.

56
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,470
<i>Well, give it what you got.</i>

57
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,047
So, all three went down?

58
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:56,682
Seems that way.

59
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,651
And Hakim is around here?

60
00:06:58,951 --> 00:06:59,952
Seems that way.

61
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,922
He doesn't even know
how much that thing is worth.

62
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,091
A pet shop?

63
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,426
A shady one at that.

64
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:12,865
Hey, bro, you can buy
anything here on Mars.

65
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,502
From guns to human lives.

66
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,971
If you wanna know,
show me what you got.

67
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:22,208
The chain on this one is long.
Must be <i>The Way of the Dragon</i> model.

68
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:26,112
Oh, you can tell?
That's a rare one from the '30s!

69
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,015
It sure is an antique.

70
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:34,086
Try the store called Animal Treasure
off of Caiphon Road.

71
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,622
I'm sure you'll find something there.

72
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:46,032
Okay, I'll look, but I'll decide if I
want to buy it from you after I see it.

73
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,166
Oh, all right.

74
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:04,016
Run out of funds changing your
face around too much, Hakim?

75
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,518
Wait a sec.

76
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:06,953
Hey, don't move.

77
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:10,556
You sure are restless,
changing your face around this much.

78
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:11,491
What the...?

79
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,527
Hold it. I don't want any
of this business here.

80
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,262
All of my babies are very sensitive.

81
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,597
You open it.

82
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,799
Why do I?

83
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,868
- There seems to be some sort of--
- Hurry up!

84
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,040
Oh, fine.

85
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:45,224
A dog?

86
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:48,895
A Welsh Corgi.
It's cute, but it's everywhere.

87
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,063
Not a particularly rare species.

88
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,566
And how much is it worth?

89
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,536
With the suitcase, about this much.

90
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,638
- 200K?
- No, no, 200, 200!

91
00:08:58,638 --> 00:08:59,739
No way!

92
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:03,175
You don't like it, you take care
of it yourself. Like eating it.

93
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,310
It is a puppy.

94
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:07,747
Sorry to bother you. Please continue.

95
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,157
I guess the Peking duck
has been overcooked.

96
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,226
At least give me 300.

97
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,327
No can do.

98
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,229
- 280?
- A no is a no.

99
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:24,864
250!

100
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,999
Zero. I'll take it back.

101
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,802
This again?
What is it this time?

102
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,847
Someone! Catch my babies! Hurry!

103
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,249
- There it is!
- All right!

104
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:53,125
Hakim?
Goddamn it, what's going on?

105
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,335
- Gangway!
- What the hell?

106
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,637
Wait, damn it!

107
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,339
Hey, what the hell do you want?

108
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,255
Bounty hunter?

109
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,124
Animal rights syndicate?

110
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,693
Your story brings a tear to my eye.

111
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,162
Risking your life on a dog
that's worth 200 woolongs.

112
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,230
What?

113
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:09,335
What I want are the 8 million woolongs
hanging from your neck.

114
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:22,815
Not bad.

115
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,351
What?

116
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:26,852
Damn it!

117
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,970
Shut up!
I'm in a rotten mood right now!

118
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,854
There, there.
Here, let me put on a collar.

119
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,124
A dog instead of a duck, huh?

120
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,927
Forget about that.
You know anything about it?

121
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:12,431
Yeah. This is a Welsh Corgi.
A total mongrel.

122
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:16,902
- Totally?
- Totally. Completely worthless.

123
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,905
Shit, this gives me a headache.

124
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,308
And all this
is because of this mongrel--

125
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:29,181
The dog is worthless,
but the owner is worth something.

126
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:32,118
Well, at least you should
get to know this critter well.

127
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,887
Man, I hate kids and critters!

128
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,289
They're nothing but trouble.

129
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,327
I got something!

130
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,428
All right!

131
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,363
- It's big!
- Here it comes!

132
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:45,931
Pull on the line!

133
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,304
What time is it now?

134
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,242
It's four o'clock now.

135
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:58,844
Two hours.

136
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:04,383
Who was that with Hakim? His ally?

137
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,451
Seems that way.

138
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,854
We got no clues?
We have to do something.

139
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:11,290
If that falls into police hands,
we're in deep shit.

140
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,424
Seems that way.

141
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:16,462
All our work will be worthless if our
experiments get revealed to the public.

142
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,563
Seems that way.

143
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,799
How much does he think
we put into that "data dog"?

144
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,836
Why don't you do this?

145
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:28,841
Didn't your grandma teach you
to finish what you start?

146
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,943
She was dead before I was born.

147
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:35,381
<i>Sorry to hear that.
Anyway, we have the joker in our hand.</i>

148
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,017
Just do what we planned.

149
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,519
Give me code name "snoop."

150
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,491
Yeah. It's me.
I had some trouble.

151
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,161
No big deal.

152
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,864
Hey, wait, Michael!

153
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,834
I want to postpone the meeting a bit.

154
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,404
As I said, it wasn't that big a deal.

155
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,007
Impossible? Why? Hey, wait!

156
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,284
And this is our plan?

157
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,490
Hey, you!

158
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,493
You have something
you want to know, right?

159
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,929
Wait!

160
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:27,499
My little Peeko
can answer your questions!

161
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:31,470
You have something
you want to know, right?

162
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:35,074
See, little Peeko is telling me

163
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:39,078
that you're looking
for someone or something.

164
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:47,486
Well, where there's this dog,
there's Hakim.

165
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,922
Seeing loud and clear.

166
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:53,025
We're counting on you, pooch.

167
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,462
We must resort to the dog whistle.

168
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,497
But that'll cause a big mess.

169
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,166
- I don't care.
- We'll draw attention to ourselves.

170
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,636
- We have no choice.
- Shall I?

171
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:04,670
Do it.

172
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:14,680
I can't hear anything.

173
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:17,316
I said before that humans can't hear it.

174
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,318
Oh, that's right.

175
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,688
This is so farfetched.

176
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,525
Will this really attract?

177
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,501
Oh, it's moving.
Something is now on the move.

178
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,173
Wait!
Babies, what's wrong with you guys?

179
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,210
Hey, wait!

180
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,251
It got away, Jet!

181
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,220
- Hakim?
<i>- No, the dog!</i>

182
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,625
It's close, it's close.
What you are looking for is nearby.

183
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,062
In fact, right in front of your eyes.

184
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,732
Hey, wait, you need to pay!

185
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,601
- I'll pay when I am rich.
- You can't be serious.

186
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,545
Goddamn it, what the hell is going on?

187
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:26,986
Happy?

188
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,420
Yes, very.

189
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,524
- Excuse me.
- Out of my way.

190
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,731
You, what are you doing?

191
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,669
Hakim!

192
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:52,544
Damn it!

193
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,215
It's just a dog, after all.

194
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,422
Hakim!

195
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,226
<i>Spike, he's headed for Interstate 6.</i>

196
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:11,130
<i>Great. If he thinks he can outrun me,
he's welcome to try.</i>

197
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,664
Don't get too hotheaded.

198
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,800
What part of me is hotheaded?

199
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,606
There he is.

200
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,591
This is payback from earlier!

201
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,236
The hell are you doing?
This guy is mine!

202
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,147
- What the--?
- Now!

203
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:06,518
Stop that!

204
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:09,354
Shit.

205
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,258
Shit!

206
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,794
This is why I hate critters!

207
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,884
<i>Amigo!</i>

208
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:42,387
<i>How are all you 300,000 bounty hunters
in the solar system doing?</i>

209
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:46,458
<i>It's time for</i> Big Shot, <i>the show that
brings you information about fugitives!</i>

210
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,861
<i>So, you remember Abdul Hakim
who chose a rather</i>

211
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,830
<i>flashy way
of turning himself in last week?</i>

212
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,532
<i>Yeah! Of course!</i>

213
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:57,169
<i>Apparently, he stole
what's called a "data dog"</i>

214
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,839
<i>created in an illegal experiment
of some research firm.</i>

215
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:02,641
<i>What's that?</i>

216
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:07,646
<i>I'm not sure myself, but apparently,
it's a very intelligent pooch.</i>

217
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:11,450
<i>I hear that it's priceless
among collectors.</i>

218
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:16,355
<i>That's a surprise!
I wanna have a dog like that!</i>

219
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,724
<i>But they say it's still missing.</i>

220
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,826
<i>I wonder where it went.</i>

221
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,896
<i>Really. But now, a commercial!</i>

222
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,566
Can't be.

223
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,371
Hey, there. When you're done cleaning,
feed the komodo dragons.

224
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,940
I want you to work your ass off!

225
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:35,941
Yeah.

226
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,778
Hey, hey.

227
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,184
Hey, don't jump on there.

228
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:46,852
That's cold!

229
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:51,690
That's why I said we should
throw out mongrels like this one.

230
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,659
But you're the one
that brought it here.

231
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,929
In any case, we have to do
something about the ticks.

232
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:01,333
Shit. I'm gonna salt you
and eat you, damn it.

233
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,203
<i>Well, it's time for us to go.
See you next time!</i>

234
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,404
<i>Good luck!</i>

235
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:50,075
<i>"Nothing is permanent."
It's a fact of life.</i>

236
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:54,046
<i>The bell tolls for the great ones
who will someday fall.</i>

237
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:56,348
<i>Money makes the world go round,</i>

238
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,851
<i>but debt piles up
before you know it.</i>

239
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,522
<i>I wandered through
all the reaches of space</i>

240
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:05,924
<i>and there I met a cowboy.</i>

241
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:10,996
<i>A session to the tune
of an off-key melody:</i>

242
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,998
<i>"Honky Tonk Women."</i>
