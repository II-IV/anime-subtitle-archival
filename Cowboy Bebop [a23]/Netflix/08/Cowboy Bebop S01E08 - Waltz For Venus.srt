1
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:42,168
<i>Soon, this flight 210
will arrive on Venus.</i>

2
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:46,506
<i>Some people may have
an allergic reaction to</i>

3
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:50,343
<i>the floating plants used
in the terraforming of Venus.</i>

4
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:55,415
<i>It has a chance of degenerating
into Venus-sickness</i>

5
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:59,352
<i>so if symptoms appear,
please consult a doctor immediately.</i>

6
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,143
Quiet down, everyone!

7
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,845
Both hands behind your heads!
All of you!

8
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,580
I-- I'll give you money!

9
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:29,849
I don't care about the others.
Let me off...

10
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:32,152
Anyone who makes a ruckus
ends up like him!

11
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:40,193
Damn it, why did this have
to be the day...

12
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:41,861
You over there!

13
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,631
Hey!

14
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,700
You listening to me?!

15
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,736
You! Get up!

16
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,438
All right.

17
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,507
Quietly put both hands behind your head.

18
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,875
Hey! Don't fall asleep!

19
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,478
Who the hell do you think we are?!

20
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:00,346
You!

21
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,761
Whoops, sorry.

22
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:15,728
That's enough!

23
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,700
Enough of you, Ms. Bounty.

24
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:44,457
Don't be silly!

25
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,759
This is 5000?!

26
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,561
Special price.

27
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,964
That's not written anywhere up there!

28
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,733
But it's not to normal
residential quarters.

29
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,237
I'm asking you for a favor here.

30
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,539
All the way out there
to the middle of the desert.

31
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:02,308
Hey! Don't rip me off here!

32
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,010
Wait a minute.

33
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,316
- Make sure it gets there! Got that?!
- Hey, wait!

34
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,924
{\an8}Thanks for the business.

35
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,360
{\an8}- Hi.
- What?

36
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,461
{\an8}My share.

37
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,395
{\an8}Here?

38
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,930
{\an8}I need it now.

39
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,373
That's all you get.

40
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,774
I know that!

41
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,876
Depositing it at the casino again?

42
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,745
It's better than a bank!

43
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,614
She never gives up.

44
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,355
I don't need any more pickpockets.

45
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,495
Amazing. You're really amazing!

46
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:03,036
You're the one that rounded up the
hijackers with some amazing moves, right?

47
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,537
I have a favor to ask.

48
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,507
Can you teach me how to move like that?

49
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,776
Is it judo? Or kung-fu?

50
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,682
Hey, wait a minute.

51
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,484
I want to be strong, like you.

52
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,919
You're an annoying guy.

53
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,521
A no is a no.

54
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,557
Oh, come on. Just a little.
Please, master!

55
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,592
Please!

56
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,896
Hey, wait a sec!

57
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,001
What was that guy?

58
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:46,546
Come on, just a little bit.
Think of it as helping me.

59
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,614
You got a little bit of mercy in you, right?

60
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,683
I'm out of that right now.

61
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,057
Come on, please,
it's not like you're losing anything.

62
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,662
Quit it already?!

63
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,131
Venus has a lot of helium
in the atmosphere.

64
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,366
You can fix it quickly with some medicine.

65
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,810
Come on, that's not fair! Man!

66
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,146
You're the one that...

67
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,549
That was just a throat drop.

68
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,518
You!

69
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:28,421
Oh! Hands-on training?

70
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,625
You're...

71
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,429
I'm Roco Bonnaro.
Nice meeting you, master!

72
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,433
Our first income in a while.

73
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,569
I'll feed you something good.

74
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,773
This is all thanks to the mastermind.

75
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,041
And next up...

76
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,017
I'm telling you to not tense up!

77
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,087
But you can't defeat enemies that way.

78
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,957
The flow is more important, not power.

79
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,660
You have to be like the water.

80
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:10,530
You get it?

81
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,698
Not one bit.

82
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,634
That's what I thought.

83
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,903
All right, come after me with a knife.

84
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,471
You'll get hurt.

85
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,205
Just do it.

86
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,443
All right, here I come!

87
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,752
What's going on?

88
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,987
I'm not tensing up anywhere.

89
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,124
I'm just using your excessive force.

90
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,793
I control the flow of power...

91
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:45,064
and to do that,
I have to relax the whole body

92
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,966
to be able to react to any movement.

93
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,501
Yeah.

94
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,870
I become like water.

95
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,004
Water?

96
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,806
Yeah.

97
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,142
Water can take any form.

98
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,746
It can flow along slowly
or beat down aggressively, right?

99
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,184
I don't know if I get it or not.

100
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,688
You should take care of your elders!

101
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:15,528
Here, hold this!

102
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:18,998
Tonight. No, tomorrow night. At the
cathedral on the outskirts of this town!

103
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,032
Hey, wait!

104
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,968
There he is! Don't let him get away!

105
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,241
Casino?

106
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,777
The ones around here
are famous for being stingy.

107
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:34,046
Don't worry about it. It's not our money.

108
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:38,251
On top of it, she takes off like a bullet
and we don't know when she gets back.

109
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:43,956
Hey, no use wasting time.
How about making some pocket cash?

110
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,693
Piccaro Calvino.

111
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:52,698
Usually a stingy little thief,
but went in big this time.

112
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,102
Price is doubled if we get the whole crew.

113
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,907
And these are the stolen goods.

114
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:04,844
They make the remedy for Venus-sickness,
but apparently it's hard to grow them

115
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,712
and they're worth tens of millions.

116
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,118
Sorry!

117
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:22,828
Shit, where did he go?

118
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,797
Shit, he's sure good at running.

119
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:39,679
I say we take it. I mean, it's worth
much more than nabbing that group.

120
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,315
No, we can't!

121
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,584
Hey, you thought for a moment!

122
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:48,187
Idiot! It's better to not be involved
with dangerous stuff like this!

123
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,122
It's okay if they don't find out, right?

124
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,725
So, how much did you lose at the casino?

125
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,093
What?

126
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,630
I'll leave Piccaro up to you.
I'm going after Roco.

127
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,132
Why don't you wait?
You're gonna see him anyway.

128
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:03,202
They say that Lady Bounty only has bangs.

129
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,205
You mean Lady Luck.

130
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:14,313
<i>Remains of a shuttle?
Why in such a place?</i>

131
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:15,247
Don't know.

132
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:21,120
<i>There might be some weirdos that do live
out in the desert, but still...</i>

133
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:17,810
Don't move!

134
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,022
Don't move! Both hands up!

135
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,158
I'm nobody suspicious

136
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,794
That makes me sound
even more suspicious, doesn't it?

137
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:38,064
Who are you? Why are you here?

138
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,068
Answer me!

139
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:46,005
Let go.

140
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,443
I just came here to see Roco.

141
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,245
You're Roco's friend?

142
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:54,847
Huh? No.

143
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:56,282
I'm glad.

144
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,930
Hey, make sure you wash your hands.

145
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,933
We can't find him, Boss.

146
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:16,769
Hi.

147
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:21,407
You know, it's all because
of those floating plants.

148
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,478
Sometimes they send spores
that look like snow.

149
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:31,417
Most people are fine,
but my body isn't and my eyes...

150
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,085
Isn't it inconvenient?

151
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:36,255
No. It's not a big deal
once you get used to it.

152
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:37,456
Besides...

153
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,326
Sometimes you understand
more when you can't see.

154
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,964
- You'll get better, right?
- If I put money into it.

155
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:50,302
I don't mind staying as is, but Roco...

156
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,072
He cares about his little sister.

157
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:58,077
Roco sent me this yesterday.

158
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,121
Everyone says bad things about him

159
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:12,424
And he seems to hang out
with some bad people.

160
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,293
But Roco is a good person.

161
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:18,864
I might be one of those bad people
he hangs out with.

162
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,401
Maybe. Maybe you are.

163
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,970
But you're different.

164
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,373
I can tell.

165
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:32,211
Both you and Roco
have something beautiful deep in you.

166
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,246
It's hard to tell, but it's there.

167
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,384
I can see it.
That's why I'm offering you tea like this.

168
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,462
Something beautiful, huh?

169
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:56,135
I probably lost that long, long ago.

170
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,591
I want to see Piccaro.
Tell me where he is.

171
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,394
What? I don't know who that is.

172
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,636
Can you remember?

173
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,072
I remember now!

174
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,174
What did you just say?

175
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,077
The price of a gray ash seed?

176
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,345
I'm just asking.

177
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:42,348
Don't be a fool.
Those things are like gems.

178
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,583
You're lucky if you ever see one.

179
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,990
Well, it might be difficult
to sell them once you get them,

180
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,093
but I would say 8 million each.

181
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,495
- You got some?!
- No

182
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,297
Thought not.

183
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:01,166
- How about Piccaro?
- Oh, just a little more.

184
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,102
Don't screw up on your end.

185
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,546
So, little Roco.

186
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,616
You can be nice and tell us
where the pot is.

187
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,319
If you don't want to tell us...

188
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:23,289
Sorry. I dropped it.

189
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,324
That ain't gonna work, is it?

190
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,600
My little Roco.

191
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:38,370
I've heard that you have a little sister.

192
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,239
She has nothing to do with this!

193
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:44,043
Oh, really? Then where is it?

194
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:45,444
I-- It's

195
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,557
I want to see Piccaro.
Tell me where he is.

196
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,193
You don't have to be so sudden.

197
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,594
Huh? Where did you say?

198
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,730
I can't breathe.

199
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:33,992
Yo.

200
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,462
You're here.

201
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,764
And I brought it, like you told me to.

202
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,301
Sorry, but I snuck a peek inside.

203
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,570
You know what it is?

204
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,507
Gray ash. Something
spectacular unlike its name.

205
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,611
I mean, it's 10 times the bounty
placed on all of you.

206
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,416
You're a bounty hunter, aren't you?

207
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,652
Are you here to nab me?

208
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:05,023
Stella needs this, right?

209
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,298
Run, or you'll be killed!

210
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,637
What is this?! I was just
sent on some wild goose chase!

211
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,339
Jet! Are you listening?!

212
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,050
S-- Stop, please.

213
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,053
The gray ash is back.

214
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,755
Come on, let him go. I'm asking you.

215
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:39,758
Sorry to make you deliver
it all the way here.

216
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,427
I give my thanks.

217
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:45,364
You!

218
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,775
Get rid of him. Quickly!

219
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,314
<i>Piccaro Calvino!</i>

220
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:03,715
Stay still!

221
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,424
Can't she be a little more elegant?!

222
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,465
Don't kill them!
You trying to kill our bounty?!

223
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:23,669
Bounty hunters?
Get that thing back, now!

224
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:27,873
Roco!

225
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,162
Roco!

226
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,438
Shit! Idiots!

227
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:04,843
<i>Really, you've caused me enough trouble.</i>

228
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,479
Come on, hang on! You alive?!

229
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,680
Hey!

230
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:14,586
Master did you see that right now?

231
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,158
Yeah. Don't speak anymore.
I'll call a doctor right now.

232
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:19,892
Hey!

233
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,228
I have a favor...

234
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,364
In the music box...

235
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:28,233
I know. Leave Stella to me.

236
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,235
I trust you...

237
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:33,772
All right, hold on. Now, don't die.
Don't die!

238
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:42,414
Hey, if I knew you earlier...

239
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,952
would we have been friends?

240
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,375
Come in.

241
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:12,978
Roco?

242
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:14,413
It's you, Roco?

243
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,582
I'm taking his place.

244
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,451
You'll do. You know what?

245
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,521
Roco got me some gray ash!

246
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:23,689
And the operation fees!

247
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,824
They told me my eyes will be better!

248
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,659
Isn't it wonderful? What should I do?

249
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,329
I want to see Roco first.

250
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:33,799
So, tell him to come here right
now! To hurry over here!

251
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,638
Did he get caught?

252
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:40,973
No.

253
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,609
Then why isn't Roco coming?

254
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:54,686
He's dead, isn't he?

255
00:20:58,657 --> 00:20:59,524
I see...

256
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:02,394
Stella.

257
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,663
It's all right, leave me.

258
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:06,832
I know.

259
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,835
Roco died because he
did something bad, right?

260
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,739
Please, leave me for today

261
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,613
I...

262
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:26,385
I never got to see Roco once
with my own eyes

263
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,956
Hey, what was Roco really like?

264
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:33,458
You know without looking, right?

265
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,694
He was a great guy.

266
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:37,863
Just like the one you knew...

267
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:10,448
<i>Starting next week, Ed will appear.</i>

268
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,050
<i>Wait, who are you?</i>

269
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,952
<i>Let me introduce myself.</i>

270
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:17,622
<i>Edward Wong Hau Pepelu
Tivrusky the fourth!</i>

271
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,958
<i>- That's a long name
- Who the hell is this?</i>

272
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:23,461
<i>I made that name up myself!
Isn't it cool?</i>

273
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,230
<i>First, what do you mean "the fourth"?</i>

274
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,833
<i>Next Episode: Jamming with Edward!</i>

275
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,035
<i>So, anyway who is this kid?</i>

276
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:31,703
<i>Watch it!</i>
