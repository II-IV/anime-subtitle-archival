1
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:46,306
<i>This strange story began
on a blistering hot day.</i>

2
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:50,543
<i>I had received unexpected mail
from an old acquaintance of mine,</i>

3
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,413
<i>but the message was just this:</i>

4
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,516
{\an8}<i>"Seek the sacred beast from Anzan.</i>

5
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:00,520
<i>I am at the meeting place
of the four gods. "</i>

6
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,437
<i>Pao, the sender of the message,
was an acquaintance of mine,</i>

7
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,739
<i>but it didn't mean
we kept in touch all that well.</i>

8
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:24,177
<i>I grew suspicious, and started to research
Pao's current whereabouts.</i>

9
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:29,349
<i>They say that Pao is one of the three
greatest feng shui masters here on Mars.</i>

10
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:34,721
<i>But when I found his whereabouts,
he had already left this world.</i>

11
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,465
Are you sure you weren't the one
that sent me this mail?

12
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,934
The one who visits from
the inauspicious back door.

13
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:52,272
Receive the word from the heavens,
and lead me to the sun stone.

14
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,174
Just like what the Pa Kua told me!

15
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:57,810
Look out!

16
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,314
Where are you shooting?!

17
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,820
They sure are disrespectful fellows.

18
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,392
The escape route!

19
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,828
Hey? Hey, hey!

20
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:20,800
- Idiot!
- Shit!

21
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:24,604
Hey, hey, hey!

22
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,482
Escape route!

23
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,259
Chi of Earth!

24
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,778
That was really close!

25
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:09,983
I'm glad you're safe.

26
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,432
What are you doing?

27
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,701
Hey, over there, who is that?

28
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,040
I wonder if she's a new girlfriend.

29
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,009
She's rather young for that.

30
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,578
Weird one, hot-dog bun, loved one!

31
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,848
- Maybe she's his secret love-child?
- She's rather old for that.

32
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,983
Child, mild, wild!

33
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,288
But I'm surprised.

34
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,524
I wasn't expecting Pao's daughter
to be this old already.

35
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,694
You probably don't remember,

36
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,830
but I met you once
when you were this little.

37
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,001
How do you know my father?

38
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,037
How?

39
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,607
Just an acquaintance.
It's been ten years already.

40
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:12,545
But your father sure was unlucky
to be in a traffic accident.

41
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:18,851
On the way to Jupiter, there was a sudden
spatial fluctuation in hyperspace.

42
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:22,889
Here you go.

43
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,590
Thank you.

44
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,662
Are you the girlfriend?

45
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,799
Are you the secret love-child?

46
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,008
Rejected!

47
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,980
Mr. Jet, why were you at the graveyard?

48
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,018
Nobody outside the family knows
he got into an accident.

49
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,928
"Seek the sacred beast from Anzan.

50
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,897
I am at the meeting place
of the four gods."

51
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:06,899
This is...?

52
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,036
Pao sent me this.

53
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,405
- When?
- Three days ago.

54
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,107
Right before the accident.

55
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,445
Please! Can you help me?!

56
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,449
I'm sure this is the whereabouts
of the sun stone!

57
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,017
Sun stone?

58
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:30,590
The direction, day, and time you arrived
was the best combination for feng shui!

59
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,659
Especially when
you're searching for something!

60
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,794
It was?

61
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,530
It was! Please, Mr. Jet!

62
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,401
Yes. About that, we will have it soon.

63
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:43,936
Yes, I understand.

64
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:45,938
How was the boss feeling?

65
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,140
Well...

66
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,976
- There's no way it could be good.
- Of course not.

67
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,911
Let's go!

68
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,583
<i>I didn't have any particular favors
to repay to Pao or this girl,</i>

69
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,986
<i>but I decided to help them for now.</i>

70
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,856
<i>There were too many things
that made me suspicious to leave it alone.</i>

71
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:07,693
<i>Why did Pao send me mail
right before his death?</i>

72
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,463
<i>What do those words mean?</i>

73
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,666
<i>Who were those guys that attacked us?</i>

74
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:18,704
<i>And there was something about this girl
named Meifa as well.</i>

75
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,956
This universe is made
of three different Chis.

76
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:41,828
One is the Chi of Heaven,
the energy that comes from the sun.

77
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:46,699
One is the Chi of Earth, the energy
that comes from a planet's surface.

78
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,904
And lastly, Chi of Magnetism, the Chi
that organisms like ourselves produce.

79
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:53,906
Chi from organisms?

80
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:58,010
The human body always produces
a magnetic field.

81
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,247
That magnetic field
and the magnetic field of the earth,

82
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,683
react to one another to create energy.

83
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,652
Universal feng shui is
the technology that reads

84
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,789
the energies of nature such as this
to use them in everyday life.

85
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,627
Ice cream.

86
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:19,899
Universal feng shui.

87
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,768
It's not the same thing as fortunetelling?

88
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,739
Other fortunetelling methods
only predict or prognosticate.

89
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:31,143
However, universal feng shui has the power
to make the bad into the good.

90
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:35,781
For example, if you were a feng shui
master as powerful as my father...

91
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:39,752
What's wrong?

92
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,657
I just realized that I never
spent time like this with my father.

93
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:48,194
Hey, now!
Let me point out that I'm not that old.

94
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,030
If anything, I would be a boyfriend.

95
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,535
No, wait, that would be bad.

96
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,837
What am I saying?

97
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,806
At least I can be an elder brother
or something.

98
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:02,675
Ice cream.

99
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:04,777
Ice cream.

100
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,119
Let's go, Mr. Jet!

101
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,760
I believe that Anzan refers to here.

102
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,029
The Mountain Hotel Building.

103
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,666
There!

104
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:34,674
Blue Dragon.

105
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:44,951
White Tiger.

106
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,955
Black Turtle.

107
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,326
Scarlet Phoenix.

108
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:54,927
Hey.

109
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,630
I know, the cross-zenith method!

110
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,806
The sun stone is here!

111
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,207
Are you sure?

112
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:22,254
- There they are. They're right over there.
- All right.

113
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:48,848
I finally found it.

114
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,651
This must be the sun stone.

115
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,019
This thing?

116
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,231
Mr. Jet?

117
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:15,908
Out of the way.

118
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,376
What are you doing?

119
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,047
One bottle of lao chu.
I don't need a glass.

120
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,727
Take that!

121
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,803
Hey, who are you guys?

122
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,873
You think we would tell you that easily?

123
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,744
We're from the Blue Snake.

124
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,280
So, you are from a syndicate.

125
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,782
Why are you following us around?

126
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,886
I wouldn't tell you that
even if you killed me.

127
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,824
It was because we couldn't get Pao.

128
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:08,127
So they told us
to get the recipient of his mail.

129
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,098
I'm telling the truth!

130
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:15,000
We're on the low end,
so we don't know any more than that!

131
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,970
I'm sure.

132
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,010
Mr. Jet.

133
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,881
My father... is alive?

134
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:35,321
<i>Pao's words showed us
where this stone was.</i>

135
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,191
<i>Does that mean
Pao is still alive somewhere?</i>

136
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:43,929
<i>Did he want me to find this stone
and do something with it?</i>

137
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:48,334
<i>It feels like I created more mysteries
instead of solving them.</i>

138
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:54,306
<i>For now, I decided to check out
this stone, which was our only clue.</i>

139
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:04,216
So, this is a piece of the moon
from that gate accident 50 years ago.

140
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:09,121
We feng shui masters
call it the sun stone.

141
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,991
It's absorbed the fluctuations
of time and space

142
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,126
and conceals a tremendous amount
of energy.

143
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,964
I can only think of it
as a plain old rock.

144
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,001
So, how much would it be if we sold it?

145
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:26,138
Hey, guys. If you're gonna smoke,
go smoke outside.

146
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,239
What?

147
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,341
You always smoke in here, too!

148
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,911
This into a non-smoking area
starting today.

149
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,512
Hey, now, you're kidding, right?

150
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,850
This ship is my ship... remember?

151
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:52,898
So, what are you gonna do
with this stone?

152
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,568
I... have no idea.

153
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,138
I don't know what my father is thinking.

154
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,474
Oh, hey, wait!

155
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,076
Ein! Wait!

156
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,384
The Luo Pan.

157
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:13,619
What?

158
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,455
That can't be. I took the magnet off.

159
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,393
I see. I get it now.

160
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:23,562
So that's it!

161
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,465
That's it!

162
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:40,613
If I remember correctly,
my father owned a sun stone as well.

163
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,983
I'm sure that
the two stones are resonating

164
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,352
to show me the whereabouts of my father.

165
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:50,055
And that's why
Pao made you look for this stone.

166
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:51,457
But...

167
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,327
I don't know why
my father sent the mail to you, Mr. Jet...

168
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,631
and not to me.

169
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,683
- What do you think?
- They make a good couple.

170
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,219
It's a dangerous combination.

171
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,420
What is?

172
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,256
The more righteous a guy was in his youth,

173
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:27,960
the more likely he's gonna fall
for a young girl later in life.

174
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,295
Is that so?

175
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,131
Really, guys are so clueless.

176
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:34,500
My father...

177
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,105
believed in universal feng shui,
but not other people.

178
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,343
So, my mother left the house,
and took me along.

179
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,545
That was seven years ago.

180
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:54,219
I'm sure my father was able
to find our whereabouts easily.

181
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,323
But he never even tried to look for us.

182
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,492
I'm sure there was a reason behind it.

183
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,629
Why was my father targeted by those men?

184
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,232
Was it because
he was friends with bad people?

185
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:11,070
Please, tell me the truth!

186
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,174
Who my father really was.

187
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:21,580
Pao... was the consultant for a syndicate.

188
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,248
That's the truth.

189
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,218
{\an8}Pao had leaked information to me

190
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:28,554
{\an8}about the syndicate,
back when I was a detective.

191
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:32,424
{\an8}Pao already wanted out
of the syndicate back then.

192
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:37,029
{\an8}However, it's impossible
for someone who knows

193
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,598
important syndicate secrets
to ever leave the group.

194
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:48,240
I'm sure Pao was afraid that more
bad things would happen to his family.

195
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:53,312
Well, I'm sure you can confirm it all
when you see him.

196
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,162
Here!

197
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,230
Around here.

198
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,638
There isn't anything here.

199
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:20,806
How about the radar?

200
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,174
No response.

201
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:25,210
That can't be. I'm sure this is the place.

202
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,547
Wait. Hold on.

203
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:36,455
- Do we have guests?
- They sure are persistent.

204
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:39,825
- Spike, Faye, please take care of them!
- Aren't they your guests?

205
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,364
Help me out
if you don't wanna die with this ship!

206
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,138
What rotten luck of the draw.

207
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,109
Sometimes it's good not to ask
"What's in it for me?"

208
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,678
We're fairies who are going
to grant the princess's wish.

209
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:00,612
<i>We are?</i>

210
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:08,420
Unmanned fighters?

211
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,423
So, these would be the seven dwarves.

212
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,263
Shit! They're trying to scare us!

213
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,565
I got it!

214
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,814
<i>- Spike! Come back here!</i>
- What?!

215
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:39,151
<i>Apparently, if we apply lots of energy
to that stone,</i>

216
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:42,120
<i>we can draw out all the forces
trapped inside it.</i>

217
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,189
And what are we going to do?

218
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,758
This is an all-or-nothing plan, but...

219
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,700
I don't care what it is, just hurry!

220
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:58,604
I put it in!

221
00:18:58,604 --> 00:18:59,638
All right.

222
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,513
<i>Blast this rock with your plasma cannon.</i>

223
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,548
What a great plan this is.

224
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,841
<i>Looks like you made it in time, Jet.</i>

225
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,811
Pao! You're...

226
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,215
<i>Meifa. It's been a while.</i>

227
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,659
Pao, you're in unstable territory.
I can't approach any closer than this.

228
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:32,264
<i>I know. There isn't any oxygen left
in here anyway,</i>

229
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:39,605
<i>I sent you that mail because
I wanted you to bring my daughter here.</i>

230
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:45,844
Then, you willed us to be here like this
using feng shui?

231
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,013
<i>Yeah.</i>

232
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,390
That's not true, Pao.

233
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:00,659
This wasn't your doing.

234
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,328
Meifa is here now...

235
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,898
because she wanted to come here.

236
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,335
<i>You might be right.</i>

237
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,939
<i>Perhaps I was being too hotheaded.</i>

238
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:22,648
<i>Meifa...
it's wonderful to see you one last time.</i>

239
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:27,419
I hated you all this time.

240
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,057
I despised you all this time.

241
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,463
But...

242
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,007
Papa.

243
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:07,392
<i>Now, I don't know if it was a good thing
or a bad thing that we took her along.</i>

244
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,330
<i>In any case,
that's how this strange case ended.</i>

245
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,765
<i>She went back to Mars.</i>

246
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,035
<i>And the smoking ban was lifted
from the living quarters.</i>

247
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:21,473
<i>Once again, unchanging daily life
has returned, just as it was before.</i>

248
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,743
<i>One thing that has changed, though...</i>

249
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:28,747
<i>I no longer read the horoscope pages
in magazines.</i>

250
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:51,503
<i>Too much time has passed by</i>

251
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:55,841
<i>To lament that we were deeply in love</i>

252
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:02,714
<i>The wind keeps blowing, while my heart</i>

253
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:07,819
<i>Cannot heal all the tears in it</i>

254
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:16,928
<i>Someone cry for me with parched eyes.</i>

255
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:23,869
<i>The real folk blues</i>

256
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,805
<i>I only want to know</i>

257
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:32,544
<i>What true sadness is</i>

258
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:35,547
<i>Sitting in muddy water</i>

259
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,784
<i>Isn't such a bad life</i>

260
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:47,025
<i>If it ends</i>

261
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:53,031
<i>After the first time</i>

262
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:11,917
<i>He came with a whistle.</i>

263
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:24,129
<i>A man, Andy, made a sudden
appearance on horseback.</i>

264
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:25,864
<i>Who in the world is he?</i>

265
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:30,135
<i>Is he an ally or a foe?
Or is he a true cowboy?</i>

266
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:34,773
<i>The next episode is a shocking sci-fi
macaroni-western epic saga, "Cowboy Funk."</i>

267
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:37,609
<i>Wait a minute,
isn't this world view a bit different?</i>
