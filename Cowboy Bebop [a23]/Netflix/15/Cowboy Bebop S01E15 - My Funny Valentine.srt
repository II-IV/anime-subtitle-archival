1
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:02,856
Frozen, frozen, hard.

2
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,859
No good after all.

3
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,862
It's full of dioxins.

4
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,898
I had saved this as
evidence a while back.

5
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,571
Don't eat it,
you malnutritioned kid!

6
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,476
Then you want to catch a fraud?
A matrimonial fraud?

7
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,711
Guess I have no choice.

8
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,913
What kind of fraud? Is it big?

9
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,681
Smallest of the small fry.

10
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,783
I don't think Spike
will be up for this.

11
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,920
Ed wants chicken kabobs!

12
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,624
Guess I'll do it alone.

13
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,395
You have got to be kidding!

14
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,805
Give me a break.

15
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,447
{\an8}This stinks!

16
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,252
Really.

17
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,622
Weren't you taught
that you should wipe your own butt?

18
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:16,195
I've been thinking of who
you remind me of.

19
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:19,566
I know now.
That guy with the thin eyebrows.

20
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:22,335
Whitney Hagas Matsumoto.

21
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,606
I wonder why I suddenly
was reminded of him.

22
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,943
Do you want to know something
about my past nobody else knows?

23
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,336
Miss Manley, does she look
resuscitated to you?

24
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,504
Yes, she does, doctor.

25
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:01,741
Miss Manley, does she look
like an old woman to you?

26
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,710
No, she doesn't, doctor.

27
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,713
Do you think she has been
successfully defrosted?

28
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,481
I believe so, doctor.

29
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:11,284
Can you hear me?

30
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,787
I am Dr. Baccus.

31
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:19,592
Baccus, as in the Baccus that
drowned more humans than Neptune.

32
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,760
Do you know about him?

33
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:26,733
But I used to be an alcoholic.
Baccus was drowning thanks to Baccus.

34
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,935
Hey, that was great!

35
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,541
All right, open wide.

36
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:42,949
No problems. You have no wounds left,
and the cells are dividing nicely.

37
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,052
Now you only have
one problem to solve.

38
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,788
Oh, it's just a simple process.

39
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,592
The 30 million for the basic operation,
and 54 years' worth of interest.

40
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,060
Hey, how much is that?

41
00:04:54,627 --> 00:05:01,434
273 million. Add to that the hospital
fees for a total of 300,028,000 woolongs.

42
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:05,438
Yes, if you pay up that much,
you will be free. Do you understand?

43
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:06,472
I don't understand.

44
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,707
Yes, that's it.

45
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,008
What?!

46
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,511
Where is this?

47
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,579
Who am I?

48
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,585
Miss Manley?

49
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,755
She is not acting, doctor.

50
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,096
I am Whitney Hagas Matsumoto,
your lawyer.

51
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,632
Lawyer?

52
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:38,838
At the request of the Totus Insurance
Company, I did some research on your past.

53
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,840
Miss Faye Valentine.

54
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,076
Is that really my name?

55
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,344
It's a lovely name.

56
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,046
It suits you very well.

57
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,082
And?

58
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,851
How much of your memory
do you still have?

59
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,586
This is a TV,

60
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:56,856
this is a hot water pot,
and this is a cellular phone.

61
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,125
I know everything...

62
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,960
except about myself.

63
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,061
I see.

64
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,129
And?

65
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,099
According to the materials
that remain, when you were 20...

66
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,367
Well, you are still 20.

67
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,770
You seem to have been
involved in a serious accident.

68
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,971
Accident?

69
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:15,575
Such that medical technology back
then could not completely cure you.

70
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,710
I'm totally fine, as you can see.

71
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,412
Not a scratch on my body.

72
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:20,980
Wait, what do you mean,
"back then"?

73
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,750
That was 54 years ago.

74
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:30,656
You have been in cold-sleep, or rather
cryogenically preserved, to this day.

75
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:35,695
And you were able to reawaken now that
you could get the treatment you needed.

76
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,699
Just like Sleeping Beauty.

77
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,902
- You're kidding, right?
- I am being serious.

78
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,171
Then this is a dream.

79
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,610
No, it is definitely 2068 now.

80
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,979
And this isn't a TV...

81
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,515
but a washing machine.

82
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,618
And this isn't a hot water pot,
but a face-washing machine.

83
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:01,754
And this is not a telephone,
but a thermometer.

84
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,990
You put this round segment
in your mouth.

85
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,024
Don't mock me!

86
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,994
You just start saying stuff like that,
and you expect me to--

87
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:13,699
<i>Body temperature: 34.5 degrees Celsius.
Pulse: 54. Blood pressure: 40/75.</i>

88
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,668
- Still low.
- Wait a minute!

89
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:19,806
Your memories end back when cellular
telephones still looked like this.

90
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,140
Then tell me!

91
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,176
What kind of accident?
What was I like?

92
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,744
Who am I?

93
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,213
Calm down. If you get excited, you...

94
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,115
What? What is going to happen.

95
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,756
You'll get sleepy.

96
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,568
<i>Would you like one?</i>

97
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:40,920
Hey!

98
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,793
Wait!

99
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,613
Miss Valentine!

100
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,123
Wait!

101
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,891
Don't come near me!

102
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,560
What can you do by running away?

103
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,936
Miss Valentine.

104
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:34,040
I can't pay 300 million.

105
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:39,879
It's unreasonable for them to resuscitate
me and then expect me to pay the debt.

106
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,715
I don't even know
anything about myself.

107
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,751
What should I do?

108
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,727
We can take it slow about the debt.

109
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,129
I will help you.

110
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,700
Your memory might come
back to you someday.

111
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:06,072
If you keep living,
you might meet someone wonderful.

112
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,252
What... is this?

113
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,121
An ID.

114
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,657
This way, if you die,
or if you forget yourself,

115
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,959
they will know who you are
and where you're from.

116
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,098
And I don't have that.

117
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,193
- What?!
- The collection agency!

118
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,163
- The insurance company got impatient!
- What are we going to do?

119
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,012
At this rate, we're both doomed.

120
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,247
- Get out of the car and run.
- What about you?

121
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,817
We'll meet up at the doctor's place.
All right?

122
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,052
Why are you helping me?

123
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,857
The prince must protect
his sleeping beauty.

124
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,276
We just went through the paperwork.

125
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:29,315
He told us to hand you all of his
assets if something happened to him.

126
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:34,286
If you give us a thumbprint here,
everything he owns will be yours.

127
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,021
Whitney.

128
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,791
You really cared for me.

129
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,760
Now, put your thumb here.

130
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,071
Why are the numbers all red?

131
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,907
Well, they say that debt is an asset.

132
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,175
Debt?

133
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,548
You have got to be kidding!

134
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,385
I was stupid back then,
now that I think about it.

135
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:10,256
I mean, he risked
his life to save me.

136
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:14,827
His debt was nothing compared to mine.

137
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,496
It really wasn't that much.

138
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,472
You were there the whole time?

139
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,074
Your story was way too long.

140
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,487
You are a horrible woman.

141
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,557
I'm sure that guy is
weeping in the afterlife

142
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,892
now that you ran away
without paying the debt.

143
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,995
I can't help it.
It's not a sum that I can pay off.

144
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:51,931
Now you're being defiant about it.

145
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:55,234
I've got some nerve, all right.
I'm much older than you are.

146
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:59,371
Your past is all lies.
What was that about Romani?

147
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,440
Did you make this story up, too?

148
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,043
It's neither a lie, nor a fake.

149
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,945
I just don't know the truth.

150
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,980
Like I can help it.

151
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,316
Welcome back!

152
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,989
This guy is known as
the "Madam Killer."

153
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,191
Well, he's just a cheap
matrimonial fraud.

154
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,893
Sure doesn't look like one.

155
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:24,363
Well, I can do a good job
even by myself.

156
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,564
Got that?

157
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,877
Whitney Hagas Matsumoto.

158
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,948
Hey, long time no see.

159
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:47,152
What kind of relationship do they have
that she wants to talk to him alone?

160
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,188
Apparently it's a pretty
deep relationship.

161
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,923
An old guy of hers?

162
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,491
They were made for each other.

163
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,394
You seem very, very well,
Mr. Lawyer.

164
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,330
Is it because I'm fat?
Isn't that a biased opinion?

165
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,099
I demand an explanation.

166
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,269
I got a fat implant
after that accident.

167
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,338
Got a little incision around
the armpit, and had it squeezed in.

168
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:07,406
Not that!

169
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,943
It's been three years.

170
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,412
- You look healthy, I'm glad.
- Yeah, I'm sure you are.

171
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,948
Do you think you reinvented yourself
by doing that?

172
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,617
I wanted to start over.

173
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,252
Start everything over.

174
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,521
And so you went with matrimonial fraud.

175
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:25,658
To think you're a bounty hunter...
This must have been destined.

176
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,559
So, everyone was in on it?

177
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:33,532
Back then, I couldn't do anything else.
Because he sheltered me, the doctor.

178
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,935
Maybe it was better
to have been caught.

179
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:40,306
I couldn't wish for anything more than
you handing me over to the police.

180
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,110
Is it okay to leave them alone?

181
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,979
You worried about her?

182
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,515
I just thought that she might let him go.

183
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,650
Does she have that much
sympathy in her heart?

184
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,286
Women as insistent as her
tend to be the ones

185
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,456
who get emotionally
swayed by their exes.

186
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,024
Is that so?

187
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,527
Women don't work on reason.

188
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,630
Welcome, visitors!

189
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,634
<i>So, are you the ones
that reported to us?</i>

190
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,203
<i>Yeah, I want to claim a bounty.</i>

191
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:12,204
<i>I see.</i>

192
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,239
Miss Manley, prepare to rendezvous.

193
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,207
Yes, inspector.

194
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,112
I'm glad I was able to
meet you one last time.

195
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,148
Take care.

196
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,023
- I won't hand you over to them!
- It's all right.

197
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,359
You really don't have to mind me!

198
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,499
Are they ready to depart already?

199
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,301
Is she gonna let him go?

200
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,602
She might be letting him go.

201
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,671
- You wanna bet?
- We're splitting it 60-40.

202
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,741
Damn it, hurry up, Spike!

203
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:50,309
I'm trying!

204
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:54,780
It's impossible
to get both of us in this!

205
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:58,016
I don't care.
Breathe out some more! Exhale.

206
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,718
Hey, wait!

207
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,254
I'm not letting you have him!

208
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:07,126
- She took the guy and not the money!
- Jet captured him!

209
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,628
I have to repay my debt to him.

210
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:12,631
So, I have the right to do what I want
with him and the bounty!

211
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:15,367
Amazing. She clearly
states a pointless argument.

212
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,736
That's what I told you.
Women don't work on reason.

213
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,538
Get me off of this thing!

214
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,106
Are you gonna let him go?

215
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,207
We'll see!

216
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,756
Visitor, thanks for coming!

217
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,228
Where are you going?

218
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,565
What are you going to do with me?

219
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,501
I want you to tell me the truth.

220
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,404
Why was I there?

221
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,274
Where does the truth end,
and where do the lies start?

222
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:00,479
What are you doing?

223
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,850
If you're not careful, I'll hit the pod.

224
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,754
I'm not going to be easy on you!

225
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,791
That's my line!

226
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,365
You're causing me a lot of trouble.

227
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,641
Who am I?

228
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,248
Do you really want to
know your own past?

229
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,386
Are you prepared for the consequences?

230
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,688
I am.

231
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,157
I see.

232
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,327
Wait a minute.

233
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,829
Well, I don't really know myself.

234
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,297
You're so...

235
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,534
<i>Who you really are, where you are
from, and where you will go.</i>

236
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:32,171
<i>That is a question that every human
asks himself at least once in his life.</i>

237
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:32,905
And who are you?

238
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,542
<i>However, puberty is the only time you
need to worry about things like that.</i>

239
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:39,912
<i>Only bored individuals think such
thoughts after a certain age.</i>

240
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,281
I've heard that voice before.

241
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,384
<i>Can you see me?</i>

242
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,587
Is that the doctor and the nurse?

243
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,188
Seems that way.

244
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:52,424
Didn't you say something
the doctor passed away?

245
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:53,892
No. I didn't mean it that way.

246
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,929
You! How many lies do you have
to tell before you're satisfied?

247
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,700
<i>You were cryogenically
preserved there.</i>

248
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,570
<i>That we are certain of.
I guarantee it.</i>

249
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,539
What about my past?

250
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,774
Who in the world am I?

251
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,376
<i>I gave you the name Valentine.</i>

252
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,912
I named you after my favorite song.

253
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:18,450
As for everything else, all data was
lost back in that Gate accident.

254
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,621
<i>So, I don't know who you are,
or why you were put in cold-sleep.</i>

255
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,723
He wasn't a cop?

256
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,460
<i>The patrol ship over there.
State your department.</i>

257
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,597
<i>I repeat. The patrol ship over there.</i>

258
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:34,266
<i>State your department
and registration number.</i>

259
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:37,469
Doctor, at this rate,
we will be apprehended.

260
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:41,540
It's truly unfortunate, but it's best
that we not meddle in this any longer.

261
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,474
Let's give up.

262
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:45,577
<i>So, farewell, Whitney,
take care of yourself.</i>

263
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,845
<i>We're sorry.</i>

264
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,782
Hey, wait! Uncle! Uncle!

265
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,484
Uncle?

266
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,301
I'll take my bounty here and now!

267
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,470
There you go!

268
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:15,907
Good riddance.

269
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,910
I guess you're being paid back
for all the lies you told.

270
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,881
There is one truth I have spoken.

271
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,653
That I fell in love with
you while you were asleep.

272
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,688
In love with a sleeping beauty.

273
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,493
No, just kidding!

274
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,028
I'm lying! It's a lie!

275
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:45,470
Did you want me to come back that badly?

276
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,838
You sure got a big mouth.

277
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,540
You were jealous.

278
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,410
You really are a heartless woman.

279
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:56,615
I guess I don't know anything
about my past anymore.

280
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:58,617
Isn't that something
that doesn't matter?

281
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,086
You think that way
because you have a past.

282
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,622
No matter the past,
you still have a future.

283
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:05,590
What's this?

284
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:10,362
Your share of the 19,800 on his head.

285
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,763
19,800?

286
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,700
The smallest of the small fry.

287
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:18,403
It wasn't 198,000?

288
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,908
I put an extra digit in there.

289
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:13,185
<i>So, the next episode
of</i> Cowboy Bebop,

290
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:16,521
<i>I admit, is really
heavy and depressing.</i>

291
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:20,192
<i>The only people that show up
are well-aged, musty men.</i>

292
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,828
<i>I hate to say this,
but it is lackluster.</i>

293
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:24,529
<i>Children shouldn't watch it.</i>

294
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:26,464
<i>Ladies should avoid it, too.</i>

295
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:30,235
<i>And to top it off, it's better
for young guys to not watch either.</i>

296
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,071
<i>Next episode: "Black Dog Serenade."</i>

297
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:36,174
<i>Just to all the old guys,
make sure you watch it.</i>
