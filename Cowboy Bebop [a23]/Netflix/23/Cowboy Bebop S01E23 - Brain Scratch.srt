1
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:45,405
<i>What is a physical body?</i>

2
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:49,676
<i>The body is merely an object.</i>

3
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:54,147
<i>It is an existence all too impure</i>

4
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,484
<i>to store the gods within us called souls.</i>

5
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,186
<i>Now, you will remember.</i>

6
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,422
<i>The bloodstained history.</i>

7
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,492
<i>Material desire. Hunger. Sexual drive.</i>

8
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,727
<i>Desire to dominate. Desire for fame.</i>

9
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:12,465
<i>As long as there is a body,
desires will be born.</i>

10
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:16,202
<i>As long as there is desire,
human ego will not disappear.</i>

11
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,272
<i>Humans will continue to fight</i>

12
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:22,375
<i>to fulfill their bodies' desires,
and it will never end.</i>

13
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,678
<i>At this rate, there is no future!</i>

14
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,281
<i>Now, awaken your soul!</i>

15
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:32,285
<i>Now, be rid of that filthy body.</i>

16
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,325
<i>We are SCRATCH,
an electronic transcendence group.</i>

17
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,229
<i>We are disciples of God,
sent here to free your soul from your body</i>

18
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:47,667
<i>and lead you to the infinite sea
of electrons.</i>

19
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,750
<i>Good evening. This is CBC News.</i>

20
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,754
{\an8}<i>First, news about the electronic
transcendence group SCRATCH.</i>

21
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,758
{\an8}<i>Last week, the ISSP and all
Sol Solar System Police Departments</i>

22
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,260
{\an8}<i>received the wanted poster
for the leader, Londes,</i>

23
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,796
{\an8}<i>and began searching the homes
of high-ranking members...</i>

24
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:30,944
{\an8}<i>Here at the scene.</i>

25
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,814
{\an8}<i>Enticing people with "easy entry"
and "salvation of the soul,"</i>

26
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:37,517
<i>SCRATCH has been able
to constantly grow in numbers.</i>

27
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,851
<i>However, another suicide...</i>

28
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:44,357
{\an8}<i>The members of SCRATCH use
the brain-wave control device</i>

29
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,227
{\an8}<i>on this new game console
to scan their own brain waves</i>

30
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,596
{\an8}<i>and use a program
created by their leader, Londes...</i>

31
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:55,802
{\an8}<i>which is said to copy the spirit
from brain waves as digital data</i>

32
00:03:55,802 --> 00:04:00,006
{\an8}<i>and upload that spirit data
into the universal network.</i>

33
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:03,643
{\an8}<i>They believe that doing this will make
them exist as a soul without a body.</i>

34
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,715
{\an8}<i>Now, Professor, they say that Londes,
the leader, was once a doctor.</i>

35
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,917
{\an8}<i>Is such a thing possible?</i>

36
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,487
{\an8}<i>This is ridiculous. Completely
in the realm of science fiction.</i>

37
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:18,925
{\an8}<i>It may be theoretically possible to do so,
but a theory is only a theory, in the end.</i>

38
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,397
{\an8}<i>Yes, and he hasn't returned for two weeks!</i>

39
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:28,501
{\an8}<i>Lady, you have to talk it out
with your husband.</i>

40
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,603
<i>It's about your son.</i>

41
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,840
{\an8}<i>But he isn't the type that
would just run away from home.</i>

42
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,009
{\an8}<i>Could he have been kidnapped?!</i>

43
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,811
{\an8}<i>Lady, are you listening
to what I'm saying?</i>

44
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,714
{\an8}<i>That's gotta be it!
That religion that's popular now,</i>

45
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:44,017
{\an8}<i>-that whatchamacallit--
- We're gonna take a break.</i>

46
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:53,993
{\an8}<i>Hi! Today, I'm introducing Power CDJ,
an item for DJ's who don't exercise much!</i>

47
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,496
<i>You adjust the BPM using this lever</i>

48
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,499
<i>and it allows you to be a DJ
while you exercise!</i>

49
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,536
{\an8}<i>Then, the reason
you decided to join is...?</i>

50
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,840
{\an8}<i>Yes...
I got tired of my debt-filled life...</i>

51
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,543
{\an8}<i>and that was when I found this.</i>

52
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:14,514
{\an8}<i>Yes... if I rid myself of a body,
I'll no longer need money</i>

53
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,986
- Hey, Jet.
- Hold on. It's almost done.

54
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,954
I don't care. Just get over here.

55
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:29,929
{\an8}<i>By releasing the spirit from the body,
we are able to discard all desire.</i>

56
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:34,400
- <i>So, you're going to forget your debt?</i>
- I thought we hadn't seen her in a while.

57
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,802
What kind of joke is this?

58
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,640
<i>Brain Dream!</i>

59
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,745
<i>The new game console, Brain Dream,
can read your mind!</i>

60
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:51,050
<i>Control your games
the way that you want to!</i>

61
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,386
<i>Are you always fighting
with your controls?</i>

62
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,954
<i>Do the cords get tangled?</i>

63
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:58,758
<i>If that's the case,
then let's dream together!</i>

64
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:04,397
<i>And so, at our station, we have
the strictest policies in the world</i>

65
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:05,832
<i>against programs such as this.</i>

66
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,069
Oh, there it is.

67
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,071
I'm gonna eat now!

68
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:16,576
Dr. Londes. Wanted for murder.

69
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,911
The bounty is an amazing 38 million.

70
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:22,081
I see.
That's enough for her to flake out on us.

71
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:27,854
This guy was apparently
a neurobiology researcher 50 years ago.

72
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:32,658
However, one day he suddenly
had a vision from God...

73
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,995
and immersed himself in research
to store the human spirit,

74
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:39,098
the functions of the brain itself,
as digital data.

75
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,668
Since then, he's been missing.

76
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:44,937
Then, two years ago, he reappeared

77
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,707
to form the electronic transcendence group SCRATCH.

78
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,475
What the hell is that?

79
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,544
In other words, a new religious cult.

80
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:55,982
Anyway, according to him,
the human brain function itself

81
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,651
is a weak stream of electronic pulses,

82
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,787
{\an8}so if you are able to copy that as data,

83
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:04,991
{\an8}and replay it over
the universal network as a program,

84
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:08,127
you can exist only as a soul.

85
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,430
Are you listening to me?

86
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,832
Well, it's up to you to believe it or not.

87
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,135
There are already 20,000 believers,

88
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:19,071
of which approximately 100
have committed suicide

89
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,973
or ended up missing.

90
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:25,011
And so, the cops have started
moving their lazy asses.

91
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,779
His face ain't appetizing.

92
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,481
Seconds!

93
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,582
That's all.

94
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,184
We're gonna go after him, too.

95
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,188
<i>We are SCRATCH,
an electronic transcendence group.</i>

96
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:40,860
<i>We are disciples of God,
sent here to free your soul from your body</i>

97
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,464
<i>and lead you
to the infinite sea of electrons.</i>

98
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:50,930
Searching, searching. Where are you?

99
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,739
Oh, so, you want to be a member as well?

100
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,174
Yeah, I guess.

101
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,112
For that,
we need to cleanse your soul first.

102
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,613
As the first step--

103
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:12,218
Before that,
I want to meet this Mr. Londes.

104
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,987
- Do you know where he is?
- Oh, of course.

105
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,255
Really?

106
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:17,957
He's in heaven.

107
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,097
Londes?

108
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,134
Hum, did such a guy exist?

109
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,102
You gotta help me, old man.

110
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:34,140
You're the only colleague of his
that is still alive.

111
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,045
Can't you remember something? Anything?

112
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,049
Maybe he existed, maybe he didn't.

113
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,217
Which is it?

114
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,896
Oh, then you want
to be a member as well?

115
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:57,863
Yeah, I guess.

116
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,900
For that,
we need to cleanse your soul first.

117
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:06,005
- As the first step--
- Oh, can I ask something before that?

118
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,040
I want to see Mr. Londes.

119
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:11,377
Well, his soul or whatever will do, anything.

120
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,245
But how can I meet him?

121
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,849
Do you really want to become a member?

122
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:27,627
<i>And so, Dr. Londes is the center
of everyone's attention.</i>

123
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,096
<i>The first big-name guy in a while!</i>

124
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:33,199
<i>Unfortunately,
we have absolutely no new information!</i>

125
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:34,233
<i>Oh, my.</i>

126
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:38,704
{\an8}<i>Everyone is doing their best to find him,
but there just isn't any information.</i>

127
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:42,708
{\an8}<i>We're seeing his face, virtually,
every day from SCRATCH's TV programs,</i>

128
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,810
{\an8}<i>but we know nothing important about him.</i>

129
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,114
<i>Is he really a soul without a body?</i>

130
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:51,317
<i>Now, I have one other bit
of important news for you.</i>

131
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,085
<i>Oh, what is it?</i>

132
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,222
<i>- Actually--
- Hurry up and tell me!</i>

133
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,058
<i>We've been on the air for a long time now,</i>

134
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,728
<i>and I know it's sudden,
but this is our final episode!</i>

135
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:03,829
<i>You're kidding?!</i>

136
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,066
<i>They're canning us because of low ratings, unfortunately.</i>

137
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,969
<i>Unfortunately?!
How come I didn't hear about this?!</i>

138
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,180
- No good?
- No good.

139
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,082
I got nothing, either.

140
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,419
Nope, nope!

141
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,089
I went after his colleagues
from his research days,

142
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:31,891
but it was all for nothing.

143
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,026
And I got nothing out of the members.

144
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,330
It's Faye-Faye.

145
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:45,104
{\an8}<i>I'm in... a little... trouble.</i>

146
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:46,939
{\an8}<i>Are you listening?</i>

147
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:50,876
{\an8}<i>I think I really can...
get rid of my debt.</i>

148
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,352
Anyway, I'm trusting you with Faye.

149
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:04,290
<i>I'm gonna be having a hard time
if you're gonna be baby-sitting forever.</i>

150
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:06,125
As I said...

151
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:11,263
Brain Dream is pretty rare.
I have to line up here if I want one.

152
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,867
<i>Are you really going
to hack into his home page?</i>

153
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,937
That's the only lead we got left.

154
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:21,140
<i>Beyond that, Faye seems to have
dug something up, so we can use that.</i>

155
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:22,875
It's about that time.

156
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,385
- All right, go for it.
- Okay.

157
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:41,026
<i>Welcome to SCRATCH,
an electronic transcendence group.</i>

158
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,196
<i>Head straight if you wish to join us.</i>

159
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:49,168
<i>Head over that way to request
more detailed information about SCRATCH.</i>

160
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,771
So, I guess I can't copy
my spirit immediately.

161
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,273
Guess I have no choice.

162
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:59,178
<i>Joining us?
Please, input your personal data.</i>

163
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,349
Data, data. Fake data!

164
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,526
<i>Blood, muscle, and bone...</i>

165
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,997
<i>when those are lost, humans face death.</i>

166
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:30,476
<i>What lies beyond that?
Heaven? Hell? Reincarnation?</i>

167
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:34,813
<i>Such things cannot possibly exist.
Those are mere excuses.</i>

168
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,117
What's wrong?

169
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:41,453
What is this?

170
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:52,231
<i>None of the previous paths to salvation
had such a clear vision as this.</i>

171
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,973
<i>Awaken your spirit!</i>

172
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,276
<i>Now, be rid of that filthy body!</i>

173
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:13,352
High frequency?

174
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,921
<i>Yeah. I'm not exactly sure,</i>

175
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:19,291
<i>but it has some contraption
that paralyzes the sympathetic nerves.</i>

176
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:24,363
In seconds, everything before my eyes
went blank and I passed out.

177
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:28,601
If Ein didn't realize it and bite me,
I would have been...

178
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,603
A member of SCRATCH.

179
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:34,540
Anyway, we need to devise
a countermeasure to--

180
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,076
<i>- Well, I'll try becoming a member now.</i>
- Hey, Spike!

181
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,110
<i>Hey!</i>

182
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,452
I'm sure dogs have brain waves, too.

183
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,621
Ed wanna wear it, too!

184
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:52,958
If you become a member,
who's going to look Londes up?

185
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,394
Do it.

186
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:02,067
<i>Welcome to SCRATCH,
an electronic transcendence gr--</i>

187
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,540
Good going, Ed!

188
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,627
This is...

189
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,233
Can this really be?

190
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:43,208
<i>A guy named Londes never existed.</i>

191
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:48,080
<i>His past, all the records,
they were all counterfeit.</i>

192
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:52,484
And all the controls lead back to here...

193
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,020
Alles Valley Hospice.

194
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,459
Ed, help me.

195
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,176
Papa.

196
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,245
- Not yet!
- Papa!

197
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,031
Nobody here would want visitors.

198
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,433
And you need an appointment
to see someone.

199
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,103
Or did you come here for an inheritance?

200
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:45,337
Nothing of the sort!

201
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:49,508
Actually,
this girl's twin brother is here.

202
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:50,743
Papa!

203
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,012
Girl? Is she really a girl?

204
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:55,147
Papa!

205
00:16:56,415 --> 00:17:00,119
Actually... it's a long story.

206
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,324
<i>I'm just having her sleep.</i>

207
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:11,563
<i>Of course, the other bounty hunters
all slept to death.</i>

208
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:20,172
We finally tracked the long-lost brother
to be here.

209
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,574
Papa!

210
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:26,712
It was a shock to my daughter.
She has been insane ever since.

211
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,749
I thought about having
her meet her brother just once.

212
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,819
- You can go.
- I can't thank you enough.

213
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:37,556
Why do you kill off your members?

214
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,358
What's your purpose?

215
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:43,128
<i>I am not forcing anything.</i>

216
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:49,101
<i>They are merely practicing a faith
that they've decided to believe in.</i>

217
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,704
<i>Why do you think people believe in God?</i>

218
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:56,642
<i>It's because they want to.</i>

219
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:01,613
<i>It's not easy living in this rotten world.</i>

220
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:06,285
<i>There is nothing certain
while living on in this world.</i>

221
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,686
<i>Do you get it?</i>

222
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,323
<i>God didn't create humans.</i>

223
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,193
<i>Humans created God.</i>

224
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:24,503
He's it?

225
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,510
<i>I'm sick of this little act.</i>

226
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:36,515
What's wrong? Come on out.
An illusion isn't enough for me.

227
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,384
<i>That is correct.</i>

228
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:43,722
<i>A man named Londes
does not exist in this world.</i>

229
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,892
<i>He is merely an imaginary character
I created.</i>

230
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,896
<i>A mere illusion created by scanning lines.</i>

231
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:55,501
Is this a brain wave controller
like Brain Dream?

232
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,136
Hey, Ed.

233
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:01,139
Can you cut the connection between
the controller and the network?

234
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:02,241
Yeah.

235
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,576
But don't turn off
the life-support system.

236
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:12,885
<i>Do you know what the greatest and worst
invention that humans ever made was?</i>

237
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,256
<i>Television.</i>

238
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,692
<i>Television controls people
using information</i>

239
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,595
<i>and steals their sense of reality.</i>

240
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:28,867
<i>Yes, now television itself is a religion.</i>

241
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,374
<i>TV has created people</i>

242
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:39,478
<i>that are easily fooled
by such an idiotic fantasy.</i>

243
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:57,496
Just like a little kid.

244
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:58,864
<i>What?</i>

245
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:05,771
You are the one who can't tell...
fantasy from reality, Londes.

246
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:10,309
If you want to dream, dream alone.

247
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,979
<i>W--? What do you know?!</i>

248
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,849
<i>What do you think you know about me?</i>

249
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,553
<i>What--? What are you doing?!</i>

250
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,288
<i>Stop!</i>

251
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:24,790
<i>Help! You can't do that!</i>

252
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:27,993
<i>Stop! Shit.</i>

253
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,528
<i>Stop it!</i>

254
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:31,597
<i>Stop it!!</i>

255
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:33,232
<i>Don't turn it off!</i>

256
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,767
<i>What--? What did I do?!</i>

257
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,638
<i>No. This is unfair.</i>

258
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,574
<i>Why am I the only one?</i>

259
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:44,910
<i>Shit.</i>

260
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,312
<i>Everyone... should have had...</i>

261
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:51,717
<i>the same... body... as me.</i>

262
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,320
<i>No. I...</i>

263
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:57,656
<i>I don't want to disappear!</i>

264
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,492
<i>I don't want to disappear.</i>

265
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,567
Ronny Spangen. Previously a hacker.

266
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:15,374
A boy who became a vegetable two years ago
from a medical accident.

267
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:23,849
No, you are no longer a boy.
You're a damn good con-artist.

268
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,493
Oh, long time no see.

269
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,595
Where am I?

270
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,970
It was all a kid's dream.

271
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:49,641
Yeah, all he could do was dream.

272
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,551
This time, have sweet dreams.

273
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:11,596
<i>Our souls that God has given us,
our spirit.</i>

274
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:16,902
<i>Is not our body an existence
all too small and weak for our spirits...</i>

275
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:22,641
<i>which found a way to swim through
the vast network</i>

276
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:26,078
<i>and live in the infinity of space?</i>

277
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:47,799
<i>Too much time has passed by</i>

278
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:53,004
<i>To lament that we were deeply in love</i>

279
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:59,745
<i>The wind keeps blowing, while my heart</i>

280
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:05,150
<i>Cannot heal all the tears in it</i>

281
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:14,126
<i>Someone cry for me with parched eyes</i>

282
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:20,866
<i>The real folk blues</i>

283
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,869
<i>I only want to know</i>

284
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:29,574
<i>What true sadness is</i>

285
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,577
<i>Sitting in muddy water</i>

286
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,814
<i>Isn't such a bad life</i>

287
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:44,089
<i>If it ends</i>

288
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:50,128
<i>After the first time</i>

289
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,473
<i>Next episode: "Hard Luck Woman."</i>
