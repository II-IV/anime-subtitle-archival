1
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:16,503
And so, the turtle took him to a
place called Ryuuguujou as a reward.

2
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:17,770
Ryuuguujou?

3
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:22,208
Yeah. At that palace,
they held a welcome party for him.

4
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,878
Beautiful women,
and scrumptious feasts.

5
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:27,180
Breams and halibut swam about,

6
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,516
and so he spent his
time as if in a dream.

7
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,284
I see...

8
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,454
I haven't eaten breams or
halibut in quite a while...

9
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:38,358
Days passed before he knew it,
and when he was about to go back

10
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:41,327
he was given the Tamatebako
as a souvenir.

11
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,863
Tamatebako? Is that yummy?

12
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:47,667
It's not food.
It's a chest with treasure inside.

13
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,503
I haven't seen any treasure
in quite a while either...

14
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:55,842
You guys are so tasteless.
This is an old fantasy tale!

15
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,177
The turtle's Tamatebako...

16
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:59,779
What were you listening to?

17
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,194
I should quit the horses now.

18
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,951
Pay up 6300 woolongs.

19
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,919
What, where did that come from?

20
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,388
This was for you.

21
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,324
For... me?

22
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,392
C.O.D. even.

23
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,695
To top it off, no return address.

24
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,764
I had no choice but to accept it...

25
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,267
H--Hey! Wait!!

26
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,406
Hey! What about the 6300 woolongs?!

27
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,408
Busy woman.

28
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,279
Could it be a collection agency
from the life extension firm?

29
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,280
Or...

30
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,681
No, could it be...

31
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,884
I just have too
many things it could be...

32
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,653
So, for now, I'll just run away!

33
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,591
Don't you think it's fishy?

34
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,394
For a woman who always claims
other people's property

35
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,997
as her own to run away
without even touching it?

36
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,666
She seems to have picked up a lot
of grudges from all over, though.

37
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:32,605
I should do an explosives test and
a biochemical test just in case...

38
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:33,606
No!

39
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,742
I should return this to
the courier service

40
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,645
and have them refund
the money I paid for her sake...

41
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:43,650
Hey, Spike!

42
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,630
What the hell is this?

43
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,834
Does it make any ticking noises?

44
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,403
Nope.

45
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,004
I got data!

46
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,373
Data from the courier service!

47
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,008
The sender is...

48
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,644
A nonprofit nunnery in Europa?!

49
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,046
There's more...

50
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:15,982
Pluto Prison?

51
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,984
Asteroid Actors' Studio?

52
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,054
Fourth Uranus Observatory?

53
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,623
Venus News Network?

54
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:26,726
Forwarded, forwarded,
and forwarded some more...

55
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,995
This thing's been passed
around the entire solar system...

56
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,063
Here.

57
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:36,969
{\an8}Due to the explosion of the Lunar Gate,
all data from before 2022 has been lost.

58
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,705
An antique.

59
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:46,012
It seems to be something
called a videotape.

60
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,715
An artifact of the good old days.

61
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,617
She's the one that ran away.

62
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,619
She has no right to complain
even if we sell it off.

63
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,121
You think it will sell?

64
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,957
They say he's a maniac when it
comes to 20th century images...

65
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,927
- I'm sure he'd buy it.
- I just don't think it's worth anything.

66
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,897
The real worth of treasures like this
can't be determined from the outside.

67
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,667
You may be surprised at how
much you can sell it for!

68
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,006
I need to get enough to cover
the C.O.D. charges at least.

69
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,007
Excuse me!

70
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:15,908
<i>So...</i>

71
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:16,876
Quiet!

72
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:22,682
<i>Everything about this city is different
from Minnesota, where we were before.</i>

73
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:27,754
<i>Hey, brother, are you sure
we can get along well here?</i>

74
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:31,157
<i>To tell the truth,
I wasn't so sure that we could.</i>

75
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,825
<i>But, I'm sure we'll be all right.</i>

76
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,129
<i>Because I'm here with my twin sister.</i>

77
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,965
<i>Thanks, brother.</i>

78
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,802
<i>Oh man, I have to work in the morning!</i>

79
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,403
<i>Good night, brother.</i>

80
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:45,638
<i>Good night!</i>

81
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:50,710
God, that's good! Drama series
from the 20th century are so good!

82
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,880
On the other hand...
Drama series as of late are so...

83
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:55,848
I have something you want to watch...

84
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:59,519
Hey, hey, hey, you can't do that!!

85
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:01,554
The cigarette, man, the cigarette!

86
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,490
Don't you know that smoke can totally
screw up electrical appliances?

87
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,460
Sheesh, this is why I hate
people who don't know...

88
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,466
Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot! Sheesh!

89
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,067
What the hell do you guys want?!

90
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,069
What do you have against me?!

91
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,938
No grudges, but no gratitude, either.

92
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,873
I just have something we
want you to buy from us.

93
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,542
Is that a Beta cassette?!

94
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,776
That's amazing!

95
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:27,713
Where did you get ahold of this?
This is a true find, mister!

96
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,783
It's close to a miracle that
this thing exists in one piece!

97
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,151
Beta?

98
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:33,719
You don't know what this is?

99
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,856
Oh, all right, do you
want me to explain?

100
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:42,228
Back in the 20th Century, they didn't
use disks like we do to record movies.

101
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:46,232
They used things called video tapes,
which are in cassettes like this.

102
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,935
It's not digital! It's analog!

103
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,103
And to top it off,
it's magnetic... Yeah, magnetic!

104
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:55,107
They were recording with electromagnetic
signals! Ain't that amazing?

105
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,543
But a disagreement between
the companies who created

106
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,112
this technology resulted
in two standards, Beta and VHS.

107
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:03,115
Beta had a small cassette
for their day

108
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,718
and the playback decks were
compact and didn't take much space.

109
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,854
You didn't get that much
noise when using the special

110
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,822
replay features like
still frame and slow motion.

111
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,258
And, because Beta had
high quality images,

112
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:16,496
users who were into good graphics
supported it really heavily.

113
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,699
But, there begins the unfortunate
history of the Beta tape.

114
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,033
You don't need to tell me.

115
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,603
This is just the introduction!

116
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,805
I told you what we wanted.

117
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,640
So, how is it? Are you gonna buy it?

118
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,950
Well, that depends on what's on it...

119
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:03,843
Hey, what's wrong?

120
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:07,847
It's so hard to adjust the tracking
for these early Beta tapes...

121
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,248
This way?

122
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,183
Or this way?

123
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,766
It's eating the tape!!

124
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,638
It's not getting any better...

125
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:43,616
It's coming...

126
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,584
It is... It is...

127
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:46,319
I got it!

128
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,356
Dogs are better than horses after all!

129
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,927
Most things get better if I kick them.

130
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,000
You just don't know when to quit.

131
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,704
{\an8}<i>Damn it, repay me for breaking my deck!</i>

132
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,138
You again...

133
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:10,009
<i>You broke someone else's property and
you're not going to take responsibility?!</i>

134
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,112
And how are you going to take
responsibility for our valuable tape?

135
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,715
<i>Early Beta decks often eat tapes!</i>

136
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,850
<i>In any case, I'll have you
pay for the repair costs!</i>

137
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,652
We'll call it even with
the cost of the tape!

138
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,053
{\an8}<i>What?! Be...</i>

139
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:23,723
Sheesh...

140
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,992
Hello, Beta deck!

141
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,260
There's just one of those.

142
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,329
Where is this?

143
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:35,167
The Underground City
Electrical Museum in old Asia?

144
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:39,739
I'm going to figure out what's
on that tape at any cost!

145
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,874
Is it really something
worth all the trouble?

146
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,311
It's coming...
It's... It's... It's...

147
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,680
Yeah! I got it!!

148
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:53,252
Really, I wonder if those guys were
sucking up all my luck all this time.

149
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,381
<i>Hello.</i>

150
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,016
Hello?

151
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,887
Hey, hello...

152
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,856
<i>It's... Faye... Yoohoo...</i>

153
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,858
Wait... Hello?

154
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,260
What is this, where are you guys?

155
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:36,896
<i>Earth...</i>

156
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,031
<i>Earth!</i>

157
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,266
Earth?!

158
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:43,836
Wait a minute, you guys left me
behind to go that far away...

159
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:46,305
<i>Spike... and Jet...</i>

160
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,299
All right, just a little longer.

161
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,068
Is there really one left
in a place like this?

162
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:19,105
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

163
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,954
28th underground floor.

164
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,324
It's not moving?

165
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,900
The cable broke, so it's stuck.

166
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,019
Why are we going through all of this?

167
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,522
It just means that
treasure-hunting isn't easy.

168
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,091
Treasure?

169
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,059
What was the treasure we were after?

170
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,628
The Tamatebako, was it?

171
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,596
I kind of see why the
man turned into

172
00:14:57,896 --> 00:15:00,666
an old geezer after
opening the Tamatebako now.

173
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,669
Even if we head back now,
we're not gonna be any younger.

174
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,044
This is some Ryuuguujou...

175
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,680
Where did that broad go
in the first place?!

176
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,952
It's coming... It's, it's...

177
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,698
Oh well, nothing I could've done.

178
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,267
Races are all luck anyway.

179
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,614
- Is it here?
- It's here.

180
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,949
All right.

181
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,033
Is this it?

182
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,501
Yeah, that's gotta be it.

183
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:10,969
And?

184
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:13,038
Which one are we taking back?

185
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,441
Let's see...

186
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,344
Well, bigger is always
better, they say.

187
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,427
What's wrong?

188
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:36,729
The size...

189
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,530
- Isn't it all right?
- It's not going in.

190
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,431
Force it in.

191
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,432
But...

192
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,634
That's not it!

193
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,571
That's VHS, so...

194
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,307
you can't see the tape!

195
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,168
Oh, hello, it's me.

196
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,278
<i>Ein, who are you talking to?</i>

197
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:28,714
<i>Oh, it's Faye!</i>

198
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:32,317
I'm glad there's an organism
there that I can talk to.

199
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,786
<i>What is it?</i>

200
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,422
Was there anyone who went
there to visit me?

201
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,057
<i>Visitors?</i>

202
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,292
Like scary middle-aged guys.

203
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:41,727
You know, guys that
scream stuff like,

204
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,062
"give me back my money!"
or "You're under arrest!"?

205
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:45,464
<i>Yeah there was one.</i>

206
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,832
And?

207
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:52,504
<i>Something about repay him, even with
tape munch, munch and grind, bye -bye!</i>

208
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,440
Okay...

209
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,441
Oh, well.

210
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,342
Where's Spike and Jet?

211
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:00,312
<i>Disappointed and zoned out.</i>

212
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,481
I see...

213
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,285
That's how...

214
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,653
Oh, well.

215
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:13,292
If they're so lonely without me,
I guess I have no choice.

216
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,327
I'm coming back!

217
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:22,367
What?!
Another package for that broad?!

218
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,703
I won't accept it!
Take it and go back!!

219
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,251
Shit, why do I have to
pay for her C.O.D.?!

220
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,620
And not once, but twice!

221
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,756
You sure are persistent.

222
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:51,330
A Beta!

223
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,165
We can see the tape with this?

224
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,333
Yeah.

225
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,736
Hey guys, long time no see.

226
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,450
It's done.

227
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,486
Hold up.

228
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,689
If you're going to watch,

229
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:21,627
pay back the C.O.D. charges.
With tax, a total of 31,500 woolongs.

230
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,863
Oh, fine.

231
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,442
We have something!

232
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,279
What's this?

233
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,214
Shut up and watch.

234
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:04,703
<i>Everyone decided to...</i>

235
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:09,608
<i>send a message to themselves
ten years in the future.</i>

236
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,476
<i>Oh, come on, don't laugh!</i>

237
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,390
<i>This makes me blush after all!</i>

238
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,626
<i>Something I want to say?</i>

239
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,631
<i>Good morning...</i>

240
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,499
<i>Oh! Never mind!!</i>

241
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,513
<i>Good morning, me.</i>

242
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,315
<i>Did you sleep well?</i>

243
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,618
<i>And did you wake up well?</i>

244
00:20:53,585 --> 00:21:00,025
<i>Does the light and the wind, the air
and the smell, all feel brand new?</i>

245
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:04,296
<i>Is each and every cell
in your body awake now?</i>

246
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,799
<i>Today, you are who you are today,</i>

247
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,535
<i>You are a newer version of me.</i>

248
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,341
<i>Myself ten years from now...</i>

249
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:20,279
<i>That's so far away for me that
I can't even begin to imagine.</i>

250
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,281
<i>Am I alone?</i>

251
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:26,718
<i>Or is there a wonderful
person next to me?</i>

252
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:32,658
<i>Well, knowing me, I'm sure I am
troubling a lot of different people.</i>

253
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,827
<i>But that's all right.
There's no problem.</i>

254
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:40,532
<i>I will always be cheering you on.</i>

255
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,537
<i>And now for a big cheer...
from the bottom of my heart.</i>

256
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:50,475
<i>Go! Go!</i>

257
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,544
<i>Me, me, me!</i>

258
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:56,481
<i>Do your best, do your best!
Me, me, me!</i>

259
00:21:56,481 --> 00:22:00,419
<i>Don't lose, don't lose!
Me, me, me!</i>

260
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:03,922
<i>I don't know...</i>

261
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,693
<i>I can't remember...</i>

262
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,900
<i>Is this... me?</i>

263
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,471
<i>I am no longer here.</i>

264
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:24,910
<i>But I'm here today, and I'll always
be cheering for you right here.</i>

265
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:28,513
<i>Cheering for you, my only self.</i>

266
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:50,602
<i>Too much time has passed by</i>

267
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:55,507
<i>To lament that we were deeply in love</i>

268
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:02,547
<i>The wind keeps blowing, while my heart</i>

269
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:07,953
<i>Cannot heal all the tears in it</i>

270
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:16,928
<i>Someone cry for me with parched eyes.</i>

271
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,668
<i>The real folk blues</i>

272
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:27,405
<i>I only want to know</i>

273
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:32,177
<i>What true sadness is</i>

274
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:35,180
<i>Sitting in muddy water</i>

275
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,617
<i>Isn't such a bad life</i>

276
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:46,892
<i>If it ends</i>

277
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:52,931
<i>After the first time</i>

278
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:15,453
<i>You know, I'm starting to get tired of
us doing all the previews like this.</i>

279
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,656
<i>Once in a while, can't we
have someone else...</i>

280
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:20,058
<i>Oh? Oh! You're perfect. All right!</i>

281
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:21,993
<i>Here, you try doing it this time.</i>

282
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,701
<i>Oh! So, that's how it is!</i>

283
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,571
<i>Wow, this is going to be
an interesting episode!</i>

284
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,539
<i>Next Episode: Wild Horses.</i>

285
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,074
<i>Hey, it spoke!</i>
