1
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,381
Hello, gentlemen.

2
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,185
I have come to take your lives.

3
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,697
Hello, boy.

4
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:35,094
Your partner sure is unlucky, Jet.

5
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,898
Well, he wasn't all that lucky
to begin with.

6
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,466
This case is especially bad.

7
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,002
It would be better
to not get involved in this.

8
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,837
I don't care. Just answer me. Now.

9
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,074
I'm telling you this for your own sake,

10
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:52,111
and if you get too involved in this,
I'm gonna get in trouble, too.

11
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:57,884
You know, Bob...

12
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:01,420
you're the only person
I can rely on right now.

13
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,557
I'll make sure
it won't be bad for you. So...

14
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,692
Don't you say that every time?

15
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,196
Really... you always have been a guy
that likes to get into trouble.

16
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,967
All right, this is only a rumor, but...

17
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:18,438
Have you heard the name Mad Pierrot?

18
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,923
There he is... the rumored mummy.

19
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,460
So, I heard you got beaten up
by some weird guy?

20
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,031
I recall you sleeping like this
once before.

21
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,733
You really haven't shown any improvement.

22
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,670
Oh, well,
it doesn't have anything to do with me.

23
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,209
Don't you end up in situations
like that because you never behave?

24
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,011
Well, I have nothing to do with it.

25
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,984
So, since I have nothing to do with it,
if you'll excuse me...

26
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,185
Take care.

27
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:12,091
The victim was a high-ranking guy
from the ISSP.

28
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,659
He was the seventh victim.

29
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:15,027
What did you say?

30
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:18,197
Can't blame you. This is top secret.

31
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:23,769
Apparently, those higher-ups don't want
the world to find out about this.

32
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:24,837
Why?

33
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,973
Your partner is in deep trouble.

34
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,177
<i>The guy is a perfect killing machine.</i>

35
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:35,815
<i>They say that nobody who has seen his face
has made it out alive.</i>

36
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,553
<i>Even those lucky enough to escape
will be tracked to the ends of the world.</i>

37
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,022
<i>And they always wind up dead.</i>

38
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:48,761
<i>They say he appears with a smile
and he leaves with a smile.</i>

39
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,252
<i>Yeah, he is the mysterious assassin
known as Mad Pierrot.</i>

40
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,186
Tongpu.

41
00:09:58,698 --> 00:09:59,799
Faye-Faye!

42
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,934
Puff, puff! Faye-Faye!

43
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,737
Puff, puff! Faye-Faye!

44
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:09,275
Hey, you, can you stop saying my name
twice like that?

45
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,111
Faye-Faye, some weird mail came-came.

46
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,346
Hey, hey, hey!

47
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:17,350
And I would've been done
if I had a little more time.

48
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,385
I can't read it.

49
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,957
"Hello, boy.
I'll invite you to a wonderful party..."

50
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,360
Wait, this is...

51
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:31,998
Listen, keep the fact that this mail came
a secret from Spike.

52
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:32,932
Secret?

53
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,835
Why? Why a secret?

54
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,269
If we don't, that idiot--

55
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,238
Will run out to meet him?

56
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,377
It's secret, secret mail.

57
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,780
Space Land?

58
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,050
Pretty considerate of him
to hold the party there.

59
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,785
You're gonna go like that?

60
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,821
Well, it would be perfect
if it was a masquerade.

61
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:02,128
Maybe this one
really will be the end of me.

62
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:07,099
Just kidding.
Would you come rescue me if I said that?

63
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:10,703
Idiot.

64
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,805
Idiot, idiot, idiot!

65
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,751
<i>Hey.</i>

66
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,687
<i>Oh, it's you, Ed. Where's Spike?</i>

67
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,089
<i>He went somewhere.</i>

68
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,290
What?

69
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,960
Not that this is anything new. That idiot.

70
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,462
Idiot, idiot?

71
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,197
<i>Ed, I have a favor to ask.</i>

72
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,865
What, what?

73
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,154
Hello! Welcome!

74
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:09,955
Yo.

75
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,094
Let's party!

76
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,123
<i>You can't enter here.</i>

77
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,526
<i>It's dangerous in here.
Let's play outside.</i>

78
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,329
<i>It's dangerous in here.
Let's play outside.</i>

79
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,297
Shut up.

80
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,599
<i>It's dangerous in here.
Let's play outside.</i>

81
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,100
<i>It's dangerous in here.</i>

82
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,608
<i>It's dangerous in here.
Let's play outside.</i>

83
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,477
Hi!

84
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,123
<i>All right, Ed.</i>

85
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:24,930
<i>First enter the ISSP's main computer
and look for section 13.</i>

86
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,398
Aye, aye.

87
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:32,071
That's the section
that doesn't exist to the general public.

88
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,607
<i>It's a pretty tall order. Can you do it?</i>

89
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:35,941
Yup.

90
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,539
<i>Hello.</i>

91
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:25,424
Found it.

92
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,995
<i>After you open it,
find the file with the code name Tongpu.</i>

93
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,297
Yup.

94
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,110
Peekaboo!

95
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,668
<i>ISSP Assassination Ability,
Improvement Experiment.</i>

96
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,438
<i>Experiment sample chart number 46.</i>

97
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,406
<i>Code name Tongpu.</i>

98
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,445
<i>Confirmed a strong regression
of the mind during the experiment.</i>

99
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,246
<i>Experiment was canceled.</i>

100
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,450
<i>Sample to be permanently kept
in a quarantine facility.</i>

101
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:34,613
<i>In the beginning, he escaped
from the facilities to seek revenge.</i>

102
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:38,283
<i>But now he seems to be enjoying
the actual act of killing.</i>

103
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:42,354
<i>His mind must be continuing to regress.</i>

104
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:47,559
So, he's like a child
with superhuman fighting abilities.

105
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,361
Really.

106
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,664
There is nothing as pure and cruel
as children.

107
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,839
It's showtime!

108
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,449
That was unnecessary.

109
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,209
<i>Hello. Hello.</i>

110
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,611
<i>Hello. Hello.</i>

111
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,380
Hello.

112
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:01,426
That hurts.

113
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,033
It hurts!

114
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,603
It hurts!

115
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:17,442
It hurts!

116
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,377
Hurts!

117
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:23,815
Mommy, it hurts!

118
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,285
Mommy!

119
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:36,595
It hurts! Mommy!

120
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:05,691
<i>Spike. All right,
we figured out what he is. He's--</i>

121
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:08,894
No. I don't need it anymore.

122
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,669
It all ended just now.

123
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:48,734
<i>Too much time has passed by</i>

124
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:53,638
<i>To lament that we were deeply in love</i>

125
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,679
<i>The wind keeps blowing, while my heart</i>

126
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:06,084
<i>Cannot heal all the tears in it</i>

127
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:15,060
<i>Someone cry for me with parched eyes.</i>

128
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:21,800
<i>The real folk blues</i>

129
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:25,537
<i>I only want to know</i>

130
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:30,509
<i>What true sadness is</i>

131
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:33,512
<i>Sitting in muddy water</i>

132
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:36,748
<i>Isn't such a bad life</i>

133
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:45,023
<i>If it ends</i>

134
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:51,062
<i>After the first time</i>

135
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:12,617
I knew there was something fishy
going on lately.

136
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:14,853
{\an8}So, that's what it was.

137
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,856
What are you guys talking about?

138
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:20,525
You really can't judge people
by their looks.

139
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:21,927
Honestly disgusting.

140
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:24,529
Hey, what are you guys talking about?

141
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,232
I never thought
it would be a teenage girl.

142
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:28,733
It makes me despise him.

143
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,669
Who are you talking about?

144
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,004
Next episode: "Boogie Woogie Feng Shui."

145
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,806
I didn't do anything.
