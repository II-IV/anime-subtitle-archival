1
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,152
Hey, did you do that by yourself?

2
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:03,623
Pretty good!

3
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,462
Hey, let's be amiable.

4
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:13,733
We shouldn't waste what our
whimsical God has given us.

5
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,268
God?

6
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,405
Or rather, for these guys,
it would be the devil.

7
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,841
Want some? It's Dom Perignon.

8
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,252
Cheers.

9
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:35,255
To this ship that has
charmed the devil.

10
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:01,381
What in the world is going on
with the showers in this place?

11
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,683
This is the fourth time!
The fourth time!

12
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,319
Even Buddha gets upset
after the third time!

13
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,820
Hey, are you listening?

14
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,823
The shower broke, and only
cold water comes out.

15
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,825
And the faucet fell off.

16
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,495
If you know about it, fix it!

17
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,696
I'm busy right now.

18
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,765
You can do that any time you want--

19
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,770
We're busy!

20
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,440
Don't just hang up!
What if it's an emergency?

21
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:35,748
Oh, all right.
You'll be happy if I fix it, right?

22
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:38,885
Hi, he'll call you back.
What's your name?

23
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,821
Okay, Fad. I'll tell him.

24
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:43,623
Fad?

25
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:45,458
Did you say Fad?

26
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:49,862
It's not hot?

27
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,270
Why don't you fix that?

28
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,972
I told you I'll fix it.

29
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:00,607
No, your arm.

30
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:04,644
I mean, reconstructive surgery
doesn't cost that much nowadays, right?

31
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,413
This ship is my ship.

32
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,549
And this arm is my arm.

33
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,618
Don't tell me what I need to do.

34
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,559
Now, you death row inmates.

35
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:24,264
I'm sorry to say, but the cruise to
the prison on Pluto has been canceled.

36
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,868
This ship will now
enter a mystery tour.

37
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,436
What are you going to do?

38
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,539
Do you think this ship
is enough for you to escape?

39
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,576
I wasn't talking to you.

40
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,513
Stop wasting your time like this.

41
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,348
If you surrender peacefully...

42
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,888
I told you to shut up.

43
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,725
Don't get so hotheaded, Dig.

44
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,863
Oh, man, there goes
our precious hostage.

45
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,965
I'm not letting anyone
tell me what to do.

46
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,634
If you got a problem
with that, step forward!

47
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,877
You.

48
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:19,986
I remember.

49
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:21,921
You're... Yeah...

50
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,891
That assassin for the syndicate...

51
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:25,958
Udai.

52
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,508
Caught you red-handed
tossing a cigarette butt.

53
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,912
That would be a fine
of 20,000 woolongs, Jet.

54
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:52,618
Then I'll need to collect on the loan plus
7 years' interest and then some.

55
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,122
When did you buy me that coffee?

56
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,424
That's long past
the statute of limitations!

57
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,864
So, you still think you're
a gunman with a gun like that?

58
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,433
Sure is a waste of ISSP tax money.

59
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,835
This is?

60
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,838
No, your salary.

61
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,373
Yeah, really.

62
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:16,843
No, I quit.

63
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,544
I see.

64
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:23,483
Tenth day. It's a hard world
to live in for smokers, anyway.

65
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,885
I never thought you would.

66
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,855
And what was it that
you wanted to tell me?

67
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:36,028
There was trouble on the prison
transport ship headed for Pluto.

68
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,130
That was six hours ago.

69
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,133
Apparently there was
an electrical malfunction

70
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,535
the prisoners took advantage
of it, and rioted.

71
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,471
I don't know the details.

72
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:47,140
And?

73
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,841
Udai is on that ship.

74
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,947
We don't know where the ship went
after it left the Ganymede Gate.

75
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,151
The ISSP is frantically searching.

76
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:01,020
Hey, you, don't get any stupid ideas.

77
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,622
It's out of your jurisdiction.

78
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,625
You think it's a stupid idea?

79
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,965
The reason you quit being a cop was
because of when...

80
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,018
Now, that is past
the statute of limitations.

81
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,787
If after all this, he lives on...

82
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,225
wouldn't that left arm
of yours cry, Jet?

83
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:45,665
That story doesn't
interest me anymore.

84
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,563
Jet! I'll go around from this side!

85
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:18,631
Got it!

86
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:32,712
Udai Taxim!

87
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,847
You are under arrest!

88
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:48,728
A trap?

89
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:05,678
What are you gonna do?

90
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,881
The guys from the ISSP are
gonna come any minute!

91
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,284
And the pilot's dead.

92
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,886
We're gonna break through, of course.

93
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,655
Easy for you to say.

94
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,324
We only got enough weapons
for self-defense.

95
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,625
What are you gonna do?

96
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,198
I'm sure they've set up a barricade.

97
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,201
It would be better for us to attack

98
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,604
and break through
where they're thin.

99
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,106
Can you steer this thing?

100
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,776
I was a cop on Venus once.

101
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,845
And now you're imprisoned for life?

102
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,316
Cops are human, too.

103
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,091
You're back?

104
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,760
I'm heading out.

105
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:56,696
It's dangerous, so stand back.

106
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,933
You're going out. Get souvenirs!

107
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,137
Ed.

108
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:09,108
If I don't come back,
water the bonsai for me.

109
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,209
Yup!

110
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,613
Bonsai, wise guy, chicken pot pie.

111
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,682
Lights shine bright in the many towns.

112
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,653
<i>HQ, do you read?</i>

113
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,121
<i>This is Group D-7.</i>

114
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,824
<i>We have spotted
the prison transport ship.</i>

115
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,129
<i>The ship is sending an SOS.</i>

116
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,632
<i>Apparently they ran into
some mechanical trouble.</i>

117
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,706
We are releasing a lifeboat.

118
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,677
On the boat are our officers
and 12 inmates.

119
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,179
We're requesting a pickup.

120
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:26,018
<i>Number 12, Number 13, no response.
We request emergency backup.</i>

121
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,387
<i>Repeat, we request emergency backup.</i>

122
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:32,291
<i>We have lost sight of the transport.
Current location is seven-four-five.</i>

123
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,127
<i>Group D-7, initiate code ten-eight.</i>

124
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,196
<i>Repeat, we request emergency backup.</i>

125
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,165
No good.

126
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,268
Apparently the police don't
know where they went, either.

127
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,336
What do you think their
next move will be?

128
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,939
If they are to hijack another ship,

129
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:50,776
they'll stay close to their original route
and somewhere they can hide.

130
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,112
- I don't think so.
- What?

131
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,346
Europa.

132
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:55,781
Europa?

133
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,183
What makes you think that?

134
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,251
If I was Udai,
I would go back to Europa.

135
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,487
But, Udai is already...

136
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,825
He hasn't contacted the syndicate
in quite a while.

137
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,227
He is old-fashioned.

138
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:12,431
So much that he's not the right kind
of guy to live in this day and age.

139
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,802
He'll go back. I know it.

140
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:22,208
The Black Dog that won't
let go once he bites, huh?

141
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,810
Okay, Europa it is.

142
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,780
If you're wrong,
you're paying for fuel.

143
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,885
Wait! What the...?

144
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,754
What part of this is fixed!

145
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,869
What's this? Jet's gonna have a fit!

146
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,904
He asked me.

147
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,106
He's not coming back!

148
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:58,010
It's okay, just bring
something to wipe this up.

149
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,178
Okay!

150
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:04,250
What's up with him,
leaving his precious bonsai here?

151
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,286
Hey, Jet! What the hell is going on?

152
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:10,956
It's me.

153
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,093
<i>You seem to have done
something outrageous.</i>

154
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,995
We need a new ship.

155
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:21,500
<i>There is no further relationship
between us and Udai Taxim.</i>

156
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,035
Are you betraying me?

157
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,171
<i>If you want to feel that way, go ahead.</i>

158
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,806
I have information.

159
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:30,042
<i>That threat won't work anymore.</i>

160
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:35,014
<i>Times have changed
while you were in prison.</i>

161
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,323
You win. He's there.

162
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,493
We should split up.
I'll come around from the other end.

163
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,427
You're crazy!

164
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,830
That ship doesn't have
any decent weapons!

165
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:56,001
You know how I work better
than anyone else, right?

166
00:13:58,437 --> 00:13:59,538
Hey, Jet.

167
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:03,876
Why don't you quit being a bounty
hunter and pair up with me again?

168
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,981
I'll think about it if we get back.

169
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,124
Heat source detected.

170
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,526
Someone after us?

171
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,129
If it's the ISSP, I doubt
they would come alone.

172
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,498
I found something good
in the cargo bay.

173
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,401
And we have the perfect target.

174
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:34,873
All right, Jet.

175
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:39,912
We'll approach them using this ice
for cover. Stay there until I signal--

176
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,189
Jet!

177
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,162
I don't know who you are,
but we'll give you a warm welcome!

178
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,624
Here you go!

179
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,110
Bingo!

180
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,068
That guy's got guts
to come here alone.

181
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,583
What the hell is he?

182
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,251
Hey, where are you...?

183
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,622
He's my visitor.

184
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:44,203
You've got to be kidding.
I'm not gonna put up with all of this!

185
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,339
You came all the way here to see me?

186
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:56,742
I didn't come here because I wanted to!

187
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:06,085
Don't say that, I came
out here just to greet you.

188
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:16,528
I didn't want to come
but something else wanted to see you.

189
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:17,696
What?

190
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,531
The left arm that I lost!

191
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:29,441
What a happy camper you are.

192
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,844
You never knew anything, did you?

193
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,249
What?

194
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,253
I wasn't the one who shot you back then.

195
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,622
It was your partner.

196
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,163
Jet! I'll go around from this side!

197
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,598
Got it!

198
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,536
<i>It was all planned out
from the beginning.</i>

199
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:05,310
<i>To get rid of you, who was
a threat to the syndicate.</i>

200
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:09,781
Udai Taxim!

201
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,817
You are under arrest!

202
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:24,363
<i>You were long since betrayed.
You were used.</i>

203
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:26,765
A trap?!

204
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,417
Why did you shoot?

205
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,888
Was it because he was
telling the truth?

206
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:54,760
You came here to shut him up for good?

207
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,664
Why aren't you answering me?!

208
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,700
It was your fault, Jet.

209
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,270
It ended up this way because
you went in on your own.

210
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,875
You know what happens to people who
go against the syndicate, right?

211
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:19,217
Either they all quit like you,
or they die.

212
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:22,754
We can't live on
with our pretty little ideals.

213
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,591
That's why you betrayed me...

214
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,726
and kept fooling me?!

215
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,798
I wanted to team up
with you like back then.

216
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,645
Time for farewells, Jet.

217
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,363
Fad!

218
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,573
Jet...

219
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,582
You didn't...

220
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,418
Did you let me shoot on purpose?

221
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,389
Can I have... a smoke?

222
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:46,571
I guess... I couldn't quit smoking.

223
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:16,121
<i>This time, the three of us
will try to do the previews!</i>

224
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,722
<i>Do you think we can do it?</i>

225
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:21,493
<i>We only have 30 seconds!
If you're too slow, it'll all be over!</i>

226
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:22,794
<i>You sure are restless.</i>

227
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,564
<i>Anyway, what kind of story
is it next time?</i>

228
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:26,798
<i>I can't remember.</i>

229
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,467
<i>What are you doing?!
We're already running out of time!</i>

230
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,970
<i>Come on, at least tell them the title!</i>

231
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,806
<i>Next episode... Wait, what was it?</i>

232
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,541
<i>We couldn't do it after all!</i>
