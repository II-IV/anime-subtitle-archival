1
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:20,420
It was raining that day as well...

2
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,357
You didn’t come because of the rain?

3
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:29,029
I was supposed to kill you...

4
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:33,333
That day...

5
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,136
if I had killed you...

6
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:38,571
I would have been free.

7
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,210
So, why didn’t you?

8
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,581
Why did you choose to be pursued?

9
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:50,784
Why...

10
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:53,186
did you... love me?

11
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:05,131
Let’s just run away somewhere.

12
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,104
Truly escape from this world...

13
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,572
and go where no one else is...

14
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,143
Just the two of us...

15
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,300
What about him?

16
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,170
He got away.

17
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,509
All our men were defeated,
we ran out of weapons...

18
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,643
and lost all means to--

19
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:52,579
Why did you come back?

20
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,815
Where is Julia?

21
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,451
I don’t know...

22
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,495
Shin.

23
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,698
Don’t follow in Lin’s footsteps.

24
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,610
Keep going, and pass the place.

25
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,518
What?

26
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,520
Someone might have gotten here already.

27
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:35,855
Wait here.

28
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:44,430
Annie?

29
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,839
I told them that you weren’t here.

30
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,475
That you were already dead.

31
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,177
I told them...

32
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,512
Don’t talk.

33
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:01,648
Vicious...

34
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:05,518
killed off the elders, they said.

35
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:12,458
Everyone has lost sense
of where they want to be...

36
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,428
Just like kites with no strings.

37
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,335
I see... you were able to meet Julia...

38
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,803
I’m glad...

39
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,839
Annie!

40
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:33,279
It’s... rather chilly... today...

41
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,478
You don’t need weapons like that
just to run away.

42
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:10,650
You’re going to go.

43
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:17,590
I’ll go with you.

44
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,861
Until the very end, I’ll be with you.

45
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:29,936
I’m sorry.

46
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,604
I’m gonna make a bit of a scene.

47
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,823
You sure are a lucky woman.

48
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,425
Really.

49
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:56,429
I came back just at the right time,
and got involved in just the right way.

50
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:57,830
I really am lucky.

51
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,533
The Red-Tail won’t be
mobile for a while.

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,969
You’re doing pretty well yourself...

53
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,705
Getting the short end
of the stick and all.

54
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,409
He’s probably not coming back,
you know that?

55
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,544
He might have been
offed somewhere already.

56
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:12,912
Maybe so.

57
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:14,714
But, so what?

58
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,683
Do you want me to go looking for him?

59
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:17,984
You’ve got to be kidding!

60
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,453
He went off to do away with his past!

61
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:23,923
You made him go.

62
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,460
My leg was shot, my ship is busted!

63
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,662
Hell, yeah! He was nothing but trouble!

64
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,330
Like I care!

65
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:41,574
So, what kind of a woman was Julia?

66
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,510
A normal woman...

67
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:49,415
A beautiful, dangerous but normal
woman that you can’t leave alone...

68
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:51,517
I see.

69
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,020
Like a devilish angel...

70
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,489
or maybe an angelic devil.

71
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,154
This way!

72
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,391
Get down!

73
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,576
Julia!

74
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:26,712
Hey!

75
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,189
Where is Spike now?

76
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,526
All organisms...

77
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,528
All beings with life...

78
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,865
all have their own stars.

79
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:23,669
The moment a new life is born...

80
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:28,140
a new star is born,
and becomes the guardian star.

81
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,677
This star we stand on
is someone’s guardian star as well.

82
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:36,148
That red star, that blue star...

83
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:41,854
When a life ends,
the star falls and disappears.

84
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:43,856
Please don’t say that.

85
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,658
“Running Rock.”

86
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,927
Don’t call me by such a name!

87
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,963
His star is about to fall.

88
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,067
This is stupid. I can’t believe it.

89
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,736
Do not fear death.

90
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,739
Death is always at your side.

91
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,912
When you show fear,
it will spring at you faster than light.

92
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:12,084
If you do not show fear,
it will only gently look over you...

93
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,297
Sir Vicious, I found this.

94
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,600
The woman’s passport
is inside it as well.

95
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,269
Surely she cannot escape
from this planet easily.

96
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,073
A beast that has lost a place to go...

97
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:38,110
He has nowhere to return to now.

98
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,846
He will come.

99
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,333
Spike, you...

100
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,069
Do you have anything to eat?

101
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,072
I’m starving.

102
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,951
The food you cook
tastes horrible, as usual.

103
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,954
For that, you sure are eating a lot.

104
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:25,024
Hunger is the best spice, they say.

105
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,398
Do you know a story
that goes like this?

106
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,935
There once was a tiger-striped cat.

107
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:40,906
This cat died a million deaths
and was reborn a million times...

108
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:44,777
and was owned by various
people who he didn’t care for.

109
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,180
The cat wasn’t afraid to die...

110
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:55,321
One day, the cat was
a free cat, a stray cat.

111
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:01,661
He met a white female cat, and the two
cats spent their days happily together.

112
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:08,367
Years passed, and the
white cat died of old age.

113
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:13,372
The tiger-striped cat cried
a million times, and then died.

114
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,375
It never came back to life...

115
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,780
That’s a good story...

116
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,182
I hate that story.

117
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,252
I hate cats.

118
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:28,854
That’s what I thought.

119
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:43,169
Spike.

120
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,739
Can I ask you one thing?

121
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,140
What?

122
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,708
Is it for the woman?

123
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:56,248
There is nothing I can do
for a dead woman.

124
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,360
Where are you going?

125
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,832
Why are you going?

126
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:21,474
You told me once...
that the past didn’t matter...

127
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,245
You’re the one who’s
tied to their past!

128
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,217
Look at these eyes.

129
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,388
One of them is a fake,
because I lost it in an accident.

130
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:44,964
Since then, I have been seeing the past
in one eye and the present in the other.

131
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:50,369
I had believed that what I saw
was not all of reality.

132
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,172
Don’t tell me things like that...

133
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:56,308
You never told me
anything about yourself!

134
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,344
Don’t tell me stuff like that now!

135
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:01,847
I thought I was watching a dream
that I would never awaken from.

136
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,786
Before I knew it,
the dream was all over.

137
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,359
My... memory came back.

138
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:19,131
But... nothing good came out of it.

139
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,469
There was no place
for me to return to...

140
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,107
This was the only place
I could go back to!

141
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,143
But now...

142
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,512
Where are you going?!

143
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,514
Why do you have to go?!

144
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,285
Are you telling me you’re going
to just throw your life away?!

145
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,889
I’m not going there to die.

146
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:50,029
I’m going there to see
if I really am alive.

147
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,160
Shin!

148
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:04,997
Where’s Vicious?

149
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:07,032
On the top floor. This way.

150
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,049
Shin!

151
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,357
Shin!

152
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,727
Please defeat... Vicious...

153
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,530
Actually...

154
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,133
I wanted you to come back...

155
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,632
So, you are finally awake.

156
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,668
I told you before, Spike...

157
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,305
that I am the only one
who can kill you.

158
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,542
I’ll return those words
back to you, Vicious.

159
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:27,046
Either way, we were destined
to end up like this.

160
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,544
Julia passed away.

161
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:02,481
Let’s end it all.

162
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,216
If that’s your wish.

163
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,278
This is...

164
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,581
a dream...

165
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,150
Yeah...

166
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,153
Just a bad dream...

167
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:08,380
Bang...
