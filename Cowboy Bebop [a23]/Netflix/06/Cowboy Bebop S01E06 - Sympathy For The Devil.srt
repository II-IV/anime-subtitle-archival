1
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,518
Those who don't work, don't eat.

2
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,521
Go find your own food.

3
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:13,226
Me? I'm okay. Women are grand by birth.

4
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,405
"Three million."

5
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,608
Well, I'll have the guys earn it for me.

6
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,515
Damn, blues harp music is good.
It's just as good as I thought.

7
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,884
I thought you were a fan of jazz music?

8
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,485
Don't be stupid.

9
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:44,257
I even warbled
when I was sucking on my mother's milk.

10
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,459
You were a pretty thoughtful kid.

11
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,764
No mistake... that's Giraffe.

12
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:56,236
All right, I'm going from the right.
You go from the left.

13
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,371
There's a fatso in the way.

14
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,609
That's... Fatty.

15
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,011
The ball's in your court.

16
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:08,781
Hey, Fatty!

17
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,851
Fatty River! Long time no see!

18
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:15,622
Oh, who'd have thought? It's Jet Black!

19
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,757
When the hell did you get here?

20
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,326
How about you? You look so easygoing!

21
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,562
Did you catch a big one?

22
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,468
I didn't know you were a fan
of blues music.

23
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,902
Are you kidding me?

24
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,907
I've lived only for the blues
since I was in my dad's sack!

25
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,118
Give him back!

26
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:54,987
Zebra!

27
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,494
Hey, you. Don't die. Hey.

28
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,030
Shit, are you going to wipe out my bounty?

29
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:42,668
D-- Don't be fooled by his appearance.

30
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,737
You idiot. Don't speak.

31
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:50,510
Him... Help... him.

32
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,447
This stone.

33
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,054
Hey!

34
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,585
I can't say for sure until I analyze it,
but it might be worth a hefty sum.

35
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,954
So, what are you gonna do?

36
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,189
Like I know.

37
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,659
He's the one who gave it to me
and he's the one who died.

38
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,661
I see no harm in keeping it.

39
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,962
There is no harm.

40
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,065
After all, it's not your duty
to help the kid.

41
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:51,504
This is gonna pay for our food.
There's none for you.

42
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,474
You have such a poor heart.

43
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,542
I'm not like that.

44
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,244
Here, have a gift.

45
00:07:58,511 --> 00:07:59,946
Oh, what's this?

46
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,984
An invoice? What for?

47
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:08,588
All the expenses that you've racked up
on our ship.

48
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,223
Thanks for your business.

49
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,091
You're welcome.

50
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,896
So, why are you asking about
the dead bounty?

51
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:17,864
Well...

52
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,134
So, you were after Giraffe, too.

53
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,737
You got a good deal.

54
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,075
Go ahead, eat.

55
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:32,211
Oh, well, there's no bounty in it anyway.

56
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,014
Yeah. No gain at all.

57
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,284
No, no. There really is nothing.

58
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,921
Oh, well, you'll owe me one for today.

59
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:45,691
You know that kid on the blues harp
the other day?

60
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,161
Giraffe was after
that kid, Wenn's, father.

61
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,897
His old acquaintance, Zebra.

62
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,098
Acquaintance?

63
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,000
You didn't know that?

64
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,137
That they were the top
of the Volunteer Self Defense Squad

65
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,072
until ten years ago?

66
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:06,045
<i>But... why is he after an old comrade?</i>

67
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:14,587
<i>Ten years ago, Zebra and Giraffe attempted
to reclaim a certain facility.</i>

68
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:18,591
<i>But, a few days later,
Zebra ends up missing</i>

69
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:23,796
<i>and Giraffe finds himself blindfolded
in a weird place he'd never seen before.</i>

70
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,803
<i>Giraffe was going after the top spot
in the group, but he was betrayed.</i>

71
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:35,207
<i>But... Zebra was still alive.</i>

72
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:50,122
So, in the end, Giraffe was killed
by some form of betrayal?

73
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:54,593
Women easily betray others,
but men live for duty.

74
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,095
Duty, huh?

75
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,831
That's what I'd like to believe.

76
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,095
Who are you?

77
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,398
Someone suspicious.

78
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,767
What do you want?

79
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:38,971
Giraffe asked me to help you.

80
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,177
But Zebra shot Giraffe.

81
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:46,712
Yeah.

82
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,384
Then why did Giraffe tell him
to help the kid?

83
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,754
This kid's showing up here, too.

84
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,922
He must be pretty famous.

85
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,892
Yeah, the kid's a genius.

86
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,399
- This guy isn't Zebra!
- What?!

87
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,968
Look... the date.

88
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:10,836
What the--?

89
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:15,107
Why the hell is this kid in an article
from 30 years ago, with the same face?!

90
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,744
Come on. There's nothing to fear.

91
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:20,780
Come over here.

92
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,818
Little twerps should stay out of this.

93
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:31,457
If you stick your neck in too far,
you'll get burnt.

94
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,129
Don't give me that conceited crap, kid.

95
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,431
I ain't a kid.

96
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,399
All kids say that.

97
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:46,972
I may look like this,
but I've been alive since the days

98
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:49,341
when humans only crawled
on the face of the Earth.

99
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:40,052
<i>It started on the day
of the accidental explosion</i>

100
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,554
<i>of the hyperspace gate.</i>

101
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:45,024
My body has ceased to age.

102
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,826
I can't die.

103
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:51,530
The guys that took interest in me,
and experimented on me,

104
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,098
all died before me.

105
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,869
The end for this guy started
when he snuck into the lab.

106
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:01,974
I needed... a parent to use as a cover.

107
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:07,346
<i>D-- Don't be fooled by his appearance.</i>

108
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:09,915
<i>Him...</i>

109
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,320
<i>Help... him.</i>

110
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,359
I think this was the third guy.

111
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,928
Now, give me the ring.

112
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,631
Ring? What ring?

113
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,134
That's fine.

114
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,172
Even if you had it,
it's a pearl before swine.

115
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,315
Give me a break, you big klutz.

116
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,351
You're lucky you got away
with so little...

117
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,321
since we don't have the money
for a funeral.

118
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,222
Sorry.

119
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:03,729
Knock it off, Ein.

120
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:05,431
Shut up.

121
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,714
Jet, the alpha-catch.

122
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,324
Shit. This piece of junk.

123
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:34,293
All right.

124
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,262
Now, what are you seeing?

125
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,267
The hotel.

126
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:45,471
He's remembering the moment
that Giraffe died.

127
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,507
<i>Give him back! Zebra!</i>

128
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,342
<i>Come over here!</i>

129
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,278
Shit. And then what?

130
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,180
What did Giraffe say?

131
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,153
<i>I have it now. I can do you in with this.</i>

132
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,189
<i>This is a stone
that will return time to you!</i>

133
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,193
<i>Now, hand Zebra over to me!</i>

134
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,063
<i>Zebra!</i>

135
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:42,394
<i>When the Gate exploded,
a vast amount of energy...</i>

136
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,197
and an imaginary coordinate system
were created

137
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,433
from the resulting twists in hyperspace,

138
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,335
and got enclosed in the gem in this ring.

139
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:56,575
And that same energy
broke Wenn's circadian rhythm.

140
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,546
His pineal gland continually produces
a substance

141
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,148
similar to melatonin that inhibits aging.

142
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:07,553
That's how the theory goes, in a nutshell.

143
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,556
- You understand?
- Like I do.

144
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:12,491
I don't either.

145
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:16,128
So, in other words,
there's no way to do it for sure...

146
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,098
other than to stick that gem into Wenn.

147
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,137
I don't know what will happen.

148
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,573
It might explode
the moment you shoot it in.

149
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,175
This makes me excited.

150
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,486
What?

151
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,355
I thought this might be
the last time I see you,

152
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,890
so I thought I'd see you off.

153
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:49,661
- So, you're finally gonna leave us?
- No. You aren't coming back.

154
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:00,472
I don't like it.

155
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:02,474
I don't like it one bit.

156
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,585
Men are such idiots.

157
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,063
I see.

158
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,766
I can finally die now.

159
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,337
I feel so heavy.

160
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,709
But... I feel so at ease now.

161
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,312
Do you know?

162
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:59,818
Do you understand? Do you?

163
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:16,668
Like I do.

164
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:21,793
<i>- Hey, do you know what heavy metal is?!
- What? I didn't catch that!</i>

165
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,663
<i>- Heavy metal! I said, heavy metal!
- What did you say?</i>

166
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:27,098
<i>Hey, can you do something
about this racket?!</i>

167
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:29,668
<i>This is in the background
during the entire next episode!</i>

168
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:32,938
<i>- Maybe I shouldn't appear then!
- I can't hear a thing you're saying!</i>

169
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,940
<i>Next episode: "Heavy Metal Queen!"</i>

170
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,042
<i>Are you sure they can really hear us?!</i>
