1
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,323
<i>The elders are going to be on the move.</i>

2
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:06,559
<i>It is dangerous over there as well.
Please hurry.</i>

3
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,221
What a foolish act you have done.

4
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,458
The fortuneteller told us thus.

5
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:19,432
On the red moon, the snake will slither
quickly to make use of its venomous fangs.

6
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,235
You look so pitiful, Vicious.

7
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:28,207
We have informed you of our decision
that you cannot be our successor.

8
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:33,379
The syndicate does not need
corpses who cannot even fight.

9
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:39,219
That arrogance of yours will
ruin everything in the end.

10
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:43,590
Take him to the punishment chamber.

11
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:50,463
Kill me.

12
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:51,631
Right now.

13
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:55,368
You cannot choose how you will die.

14
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,638
After we let you have a good
taste of humiliation,

15
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:01,574
we will send you
into the underworld.

16
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,776
Don't forget...

17
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:10,917
a snake's venom poisons
slowly after the bite.

18
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:29,469
Sheesh, that was the first
time we screwed up so badly.

19
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,537
We never had anything
like that before,

20
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,973
when we were all alone.

21
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:38,511
All told, they screwed up
our plans right to the end.

22
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:42,282
They really were like
troublesome babies.

23
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:46,919
I completely understand why
you hate women and kids now.

24
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:15,982
Too much vermouth.

25
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,057
Who are they?

26
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,398
Lin?!

27
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:35,868
I'm Shin, his younger brother.

28
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:38,671
Shin...

29
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,973
That's right, you two were...

30
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,413
If you change sides, you won't be
able to return to the syndicate.

31
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,816
What happened?

32
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,752
Vicious is to be executed.

33
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:57,123
He failed to pull off the coup, and has
been put under restraints by the elders.

34
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,758
You are in danger as well.

35
00:05:59,092 --> 00:05:59,959
And Miss Julia...

36
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:02,562
Julia is?

37
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:06,933
They're in the city of Tharsis.

38
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,501
I'll hold them off here.

39
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,569
Please, go!

40
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,771
I'll owe you one, Shin!

41
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,894
I don't know what
happened to Red Dragon,

42
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,764
but it's not really
your problem now, right?

43
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,436
Vicious, Julia...

44
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,939
To me, both those names
sound nothing but ominous.

45
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,043
Just like a magic spell that opens
a door that shouldn't be opened.

46
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,082
You're...

47
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,451
Hold still.

48
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,562
You are no longer a member
of the syndicate...

49
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:11,798
I know.

50
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,568
You, too...

51
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,971
Forget everything, including
the fact that we came here.

52
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,573
What are you talking about?

53
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:24,577
I'm just treating stray cats
that wandered into the office.

54
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,813
Stray cats that I can't
ever get rid of...

55
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,733
When this is over,
I'm leaving the syndicate.

56
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,105
You'll be killed.

57
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,976
I'll let them say I'm dead.

58
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,918
I'll be waiting at the graveyard.
Of course, I will be alive.

59
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,856
I... can't come with you.

60
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,524
Come with me.

61
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,096
We'll leave here...
We'll escape from this world.

62
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,167
And then what are we going to do?

63
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,669
We'll just live a life
of freedom somewhere.

64
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,239
Just like watching a dream...

65
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,055
<i>Are you going to betray me?</i>

66
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,562
Are you going to leave this world?

67
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,130
Vicious.

68
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:55,268
Even if it's a dream,
that's an impossibility.

69
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,207
Are you going to kill him?

70
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:02,775
Yeah...

71
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,077
with your hands.

72
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,014
You stay alive...

73
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:09,916
or you both die.

74
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,285
You can choose.

75
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:52,692
So, there is no place for me after all.

76
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:57,663
I won't go no matter who
comes to pick me up. Never.

77
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,833
I don't want to live a life
where I'm always in someone's way.

78
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,236
Mom! I've been looking for you!

79
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,839
A--Alfred...

80
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,610
I told you to wait in front
of the curry restaurant!

81
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,011
Sorry.

82
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,113
It's all right. I'm glad you came.

83
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,285
It sounds too good to be true
that you can take care of me now.

84
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,289
Mom, I want to live with you.

85
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,627
You found a job?

86
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:29,829
Don't worry about that.

87
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,397
What about your female co-host?

88
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,834
I heard she's getting married.

89
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,837
Something about this...

90
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,354
<i>Where are you now?</i>

91
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,324
What is it?

92
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,327
<i>I'm heading out to the city of Tharsis.</i>

93
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,895
<i>You should head that way, too.</i>

94
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:03,829
Why?

95
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,665
<i>It's hard for Jet to
get around on his own.</i>

96
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:08,167
<i>Especially after getting
shot in the leg.</i>

97
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,337
<i>I'm telling you to stop wandering
around so much, and just come back.</i>

98
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,339
Don't just assume that I'm coming back!

99
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,207
You've got to be kidding!

100
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:17,343
I have a place to go back to!

101
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,880
What's with that attitude?
Like he's all high-and-mighty.

102
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,815
What does he mean, Jet's by himself?

103
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,951
He's there... Ed and Ein, too...

104
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,084
You saved me.

105
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,752
Same here.

106
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,222
You're a good shot.

107
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,390
I was getting bounties with it.

108
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:40,993
A bounty hunter?

109
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,428
Although now...

110
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:46,031
I'm kind of on a break 'cause
there's something going on.

111
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,367
You look like you have
something going on, too.

112
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:53,339
It might be good to pair up
with another woman.

113
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,941
How about it?
Wanna be my partner?

114
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,944
I have... something to do.

115
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,146
Oh.

116
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:02,515
Too bad.

117
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:06,152
Do you know any bounty hunter hangouts?

118
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:09,555
I can help if you want
to put a bounty on someone.

119
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,491
I'm looking for a bounty hunter.

120
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,863
I'll drive you back.

121
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,337
What's your name?

122
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,239
Faye...

123
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,175
Faye?!

124
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,143
Faye Valentine.

125
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,811
A common name.

126
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:34,313
What's yours?

127
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,283
Julia.

128
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,384
Julia?!

129
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,186
It's a common name.

130
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:51,830
I'm glad I met you.

131
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,865
Me, too.

132
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,603
Have I seen you somewhere?

133
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:02,408
If... you see Spike again...

134
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:05,511
Tell him that I will be waiting there.

135
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,279
He'll know what I mean.

136
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,984
Tell him that I'll keep waiting...

137
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:14,520
Why?

138
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,623
Goodbye, Faye Valentine.

139
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,593
Why?

140
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,397
Why do you know?!

141
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,294
Does it still hurt?

142
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,298
Do you know a story
that goes like this?

143
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,304
A man injured his leg during a hunt.

144
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,340
In the middle of the savanna...

145
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:12,478
with no means to treat the wound,
the leg rots, and death approaches.

146
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:18,017
The man got onto the airplane
that finally arrived,

147
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,020
and there he sees a land
of pure white below him.

148
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:26,358
The place glistening in the light was
the summit of a snow-covered mountain.

149
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:29,028
The name of the mountain
was Kilimanjaro.

150
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,363
The man thinks...

151
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:34,466
that was where he was headed...

152
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,469
And?

153
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:41,006
I hate this story.

154
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:44,009
Men only think about the past...

155
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,411
right before their death,

156
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:49,081
as if they were searching frantically
for proof that they were alive.

157
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,352
Turn back.

158
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:59,358
You told me when we first met...

159
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,027
that you were a man
who had already died once.

160
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,029
Just forget the past, okay?

161
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,035
There was a woman.

162
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,971
For the first time in my life,

163
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,373
I saw a woman that was truly alive.

164
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,041
That's what I believed.

165
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:23,148
She was a piece of me I had lost.

166
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,585
She is my other half
that I had longed for.

167
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,226
- She's back.
- Who?

168
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,232
Oh, man...

169
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,235
We're not a repair shop.

170
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:46,038
Don't come back just when
you broke something...

171
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,139
Where is he?

172
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,507
He?

173
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:49,775
The one with the fluffy hair.

174
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,047
What, can't you just say
you're looking for Spike?

175
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,081
Where is he?

176
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,150
He's in the workshop.

177
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,620
What are you trying to hide?

178
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,089
You came back here just to see Spike?

179
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,592
I was asked to relay a message...

180
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:07,793
from Julia.

181
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,129
Hey, wait!!

182
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,134
<i>Jet, it's me.</i>

183
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:19,104
What, I don't have any information
now. We're not really able to...

184
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,572
<i>I'm glad you're all right.</i>

185
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:24,109
<i>I was worried. It's getting
to be pretty bad, you know...</i>

186
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,310
About Red Dragon?

187
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,378
<i>Yeah...</i>

188
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,514
<i>There was apparently a coup
two days ago,</i>

189
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:31,183
<i>concerning who was going to be
the syndicate's successor.</i>

190
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,319
<i>In the end the elders won,
and they're now out</i>

191
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,523
<i>to annihilate anyone who
was involved in the coup.</i>

192
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,558
<i>Your partner will also...</i>

193
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,326
Been there.

194
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:44,296
But why are they trying to get rid of
those that already left the syndicate?

195
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:47,066
<i>Anything against them will be annihilated,
down to the very last seed.</i>

196
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,767
<i>That's how they do it.</i>

197
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,470
That's the worst logic I've ever heard.

198
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,740
<i>Just run.
The police can't handle all of it.</i>

199
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,842
<i>Leave Mars.</i>

200
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:00,279
Too late for that.

201
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,101
You have something?

202
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,539
You look like you
have some information.

203
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,677
How much will you pay for it?

204
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,412
I don't have any money.

205
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:45,224
You sure came back at the worst time...

206
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,159
Weren't you the one who called me here?

207
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,695
Or... maybe they followed you here?

208
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:54,299
Oh, well. It was gonna
happen sooner or later.

209
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,302
Wait!

210
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:06,545
Wait a minute!

211
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:07,613
I don't have any money.

212
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,848
She said she'll be waiting there.

213
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,419
She said you'd understand.

214
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,821
I don't get it.

215
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:18,824
It was from a woman named Julia.

216
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,163
Someone was after her...

217
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,198
They were chasing her...

218
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,767
Jet, I can go at any time.

219
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,443
You who caused a disturbance
in our clan's affairs.

220
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:41,813
By the will of the clan,
you shall be executed.

221
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:55,894
- Let me out, too!
- Wait!

222
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:57,963
Your right thruster isn't working yet!

223
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,599
The end is the same if
we go down ship and all!

224
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,534
Will you leave words?

225
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,337
Or leave something material?

226
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:07,706
Nothing.

227
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,769
You shall shed red tears.

228
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,319
<i>Spike, can you still fly?</i>

229
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,721
Don't worry about us. Just go!

230
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,359
Go grasp that thing you had lost.

231
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:37,729
<i>Go!</i>

232
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,676
As of now, the leadership
has changed hands.

233
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,814
From now on, I will dictate all authority
and symbolism of this syndicate.

234
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:51,436
<i>Too much time has passed by</i>

235
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:56,141
<i>To lament that we were deeply in love</i>

236
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:03,381
<i>The wind keeps blowing, while my heart</i>

237
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:08,787
<i>Cannot heal all the tears in it</i>

238
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:17,763
<i>Someone cry for me with parched eyes.</i>

239
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:24,503
<i>The real folk blues</i>

240
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:28,039
<i>I only want to know</i>

241
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,011
<i>What true sadness is</i>

242
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:36,014
<i>Sitting in muddy water</i>

243
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,451
<i>Isn't such a bad life</i>

244
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:47,726
<i>If it ends</i>

245
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:53,765
<i>After the first time</i>

246
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,517
<i>A lot of things have happened,
but the next episode is the last.</i>

247
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:13,952
<i>It sure was long.</i>

248
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,687
<i>- The past is the past
- No use doing this...</i>

249
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:17,589
<i>- and the future is the future.
- So how was it, Jet?</i>

250
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:21,459
<i>- A man is a man, and a woman is a woman.
- Because of you, I ended up raising Ein.</i>

251
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:24,129
<i>- I am who I am, and you are who you are.
- Dogs are really cute after all...</i>

252
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,898
<i>- Like it really matters any...
- Hey, Jet. Come on, you aren't</i>

253
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:30,068
<i>- I wonder why we gave him away...
- listening to what I'm saying at all!</i>

254
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,571
<i>- Oh... What was it?
- Never mind.</i>

255
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:35,807
<i>Anyway... Next episode:
The Real Folk Blues Part 2.</i>

256
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,008
<i>We'll see you again, somewhere.</i>

257
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:38,243
<i>What? This is the end?</i>
