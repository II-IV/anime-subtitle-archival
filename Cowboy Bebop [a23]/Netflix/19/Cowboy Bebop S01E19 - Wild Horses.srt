1
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,521
Really, this just doesn't suit my style...

2
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,290
to just sit and wait like this.

3
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:07,494
We pick our spot, then wait patiently.

4
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,662
That is the secret behind fishing.

5
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,832
<i>Did you ever consider
that maybe this was the wrong spot?</i>

6
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,570
- The bait has no right to complain.
- What are you fishing for?

7
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:21,875
Starship Pirates.
A group that calls themselves pirates.

8
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,443
Pirates?

9
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:27,347
{\an8}People who like to attack a ship
and rob anything and everything from them.

10
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,316
Like to rob, rob, drunken slob.

11
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,456
<i>Besides, where the hell did Spike go?</i>

12
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,825
<i>He left to overhaul his ship
and still hasn't--</i>

13
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,463
Thanks.

14
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,366
But, Spike, man...

15
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,936
What's he doing now,
without giving us a heads-up?

16
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,324
You're late, Doohan.

17
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,260
Yeah! Go, go, go!

18
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,262
Hey.

19
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:18,698
Hey!

20
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,334
<i>Strike three! Batter out!</i>

21
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,370
<i>He just let that one slide by.
And that's the game.</i>

22
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:29,208
Man, why didn't they just send in
a pinch hitter?

23
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,811
Come on, Eightwood is getting old.

24
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,413
Don't you think?

25
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,350
Where's Doohan?

26
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,788
The old man's kind of busy. I'm Miles,
his assistant. Nice to meet you.

27
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:54,267
Man, they were really great
when they won the pennant 14 years ago.

28
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,537
They just kept hitting the ball
and turned losing games around.

29
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:02,308
Especially when Randy,
Blanket and Hills hit consecutive homers.

30
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,477
I really wish you could've seen it.

31
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,012
And you know...

32
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:11,618
Hey, do people often say
you're the silent type?

33
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,688
And people often say
you talk too much, right?

34
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:17,390
Kind of.

35
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:19,559
The... Swordfish, right?

36
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:21,394
The machine back there.

37
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,029
Yeah.

38
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:26,366
That's the amazing MONO racer
that the old man built, right?

39
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,969
It's just an old machine.
I don't want it, but it's a part of me.

40
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,571
I hear you.

41
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,874
Us Blue Sox fans feel
like we fell for some wicked broad.

42
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:38,277
I can't remember how many times
I've thought about giving up on them.

43
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,931
Jesus, not again.

44
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,368
Yo, old man!

45
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,779
- Yo. Long time no see.
- Yeah.

46
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,048
Miles, where's the checklist?

47
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,316
It's out there.

48
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,650
I put it on the ship's body.

49
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,789
He's been fixing that ancient thing?

50
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,424
I think it's useless.

51
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,927
The computer isn't compatible
with the MONO system.

52
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:32,098
Miles! Give me the EV transmitter,
the absorber for the main gear

53
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:35,368
and the 3-8 pneumatic tube.

54
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,037
A 3-8?
I don't have something that special.

55
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:41,607
Order one from Reggie. His place has them.

56
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:45,645
Yeah, yeah.
You really are some slave driver.

57
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,349
Some hobby.

58
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,693
- Did we catch it?
- It wasn't me. Where is it?

59
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:04,030
- It's close. Shit, I used bad bait.
- Hey!

60
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,804
This is a good machine.

61
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:15,675
Attacking blessed people like them
and giving to the poor

62
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:19,445
<i>is human equality, don't you think so?</i>

63
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,049
I get it.
This is what you call social reform.

64
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:27,487
<i>Yeah. It's only right for us,
the poor, to take from them.</i>

65
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,390
- Something's coming.
- Cops?

66
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,528
Hi. That's enough.

67
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,864
Bounty hunter?

68
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:41,033
- Harman.
- Be a good girl and come here.

69
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,671
Faye, above you!

70
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,945
What the...? Is this a joke?

71
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:58,651
It's not me!

72
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,821
Ruth! One more behind us.

73
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,190
<i>- And it's huge.</i>
- I know.

74
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,959
What a tattered old ship.

75
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,161
Leave me alone.

76
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,751
<i>Abnormality found in the MONO system.
Booting the emergency pilot program.</i>

77
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,124
Hey, stop this thing!

78
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,193
Like I know how.

79
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,674
Looks like he's taken you
on quite a few spins.

80
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:30,510
Cut it.

81
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,618
The accelerator pump is all worn down.

82
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:39,752
I know.

83
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:43,055
And the fuel injector
doesn't have a silencer on it.

84
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,690
Don't need one.

85
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,926
But it's noisy and it trembles...

86
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,629
If you put one in,
I can't hear what it's telling me.

87
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,199
Just hurry up and connect the injector.

88
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,570
First of all, a 3-8 isn't popular anymore.

89
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,940
Why don't you switch to the new 5-0?

90
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,941
Miles.

91
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:05,711
If you change the navigation to auto,
you glide along without manual steering.

92
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,784
Do you want to use a machine,
or do you want the machine to use you?

93
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:12,718
Which is it?

94
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,688
- I wasn't exactly--
- Just go.

95
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,628
You haven't changed a bit.

96
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:26,065
At this rate,
another assistant is gonna leave you.

97
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:33,039
And you.
The Swordfish wants to run away from you.

98
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,207
I haven't heard that before.

99
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:39,745
If you keep being reckless with her,
she'll really throw you off someday.

100
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:43,616
Unfortunately,
I'm not one for delicate controls.

101
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,090
Sorry to keep you waiting.

102
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,593
I got something you don't see often...
A 3-8 pneumatic tube.

103
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,335
Yes, hello?

104
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,972
Oh, it's you, Missing Man.
Where are you right now?

105
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,941
I'm still with Doohan. How's Jet?

106
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,776
<i>He seems rather busy right now.</i>

107
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:15,181
- Saying something about some bacteria.
- Bacteria?

108
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:18,384
A virus. We got a computer virus.

109
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,653
Same difference.

110
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:25,057
Starting with the MONO system,
orbit calculator,

111
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:28,728
flight-path selector, engine regulator,
communications circuit...

112
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:30,329
<i>they're all shot.</i>

113
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,232
I don't get it.
Give me a simple explanation.

114
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:37,803
The computer broke,
and we're just drifting along.

115
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,840
Well, I understood that.

116
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,775
How about it? It's the newest one.

117
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,810
You haven't seen one anywhere else, right?

118
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,812
A MONO computer?

119
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,915
How about it? 150K... No, 100K.

120
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,284
A bargain, huh?

121
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:54,887
When it's that cheap,
you lose money even on salvage.

122
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:55,955
So, who did it?

123
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:57,757
Where did you get this?

124
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,859
A truck? Any features?

125
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,260
- A penguin...
- ...logo on...

126
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,661
...the delivery truck?

127
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,309
Are you sure about the info?

128
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,379
Yeah. They apparently were dealing
at the Orbit Drive-in.

129
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:25,217
I see. Nobody would be suspicious
of a delivery truck wandering about.

130
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,221
And how are we going
to counter the hacks?

131
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,223
Don't get harpooned.

132
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,830
- And?
- That's it?

133
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,167
They laughed this ship off as "tattered."

134
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,370
And they made that mess
out of my Hammer Head.

135
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,240
Unlike someone I know,
I always pay back what I owe.

136
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,110
What a wonderful principle.

137
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,479
I'm really not up for this.

138
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,716
I have an invoice from Doohan here.

139
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:07,293
Because they're physically
sending the virus,

140
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,462
they haven't developed a vaccine for it.

141
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:13,132
That is where this secret weapon
of ours comes in.

142
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,836
What? That's just our normal communicator.

143
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:20,906
If you get infected by the virus,
cut off the entire MONO system.

144
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,476
All navigation
and communication will go down.

145
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,912
As I said, I will navigate you with this.

146
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:30,850
Because this is set to the frequency
for an old communications satellite,

147
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,985
it has nothing to do
with the MONO system.

148
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:40,292
<i>Oh, another run scored
against the Blue Sox.</i>

149
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:42,995
That's some secret weapon.

150
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,493
It was a penguin, right?

151
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:17,263
Yeah. A purple penguin.

152
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,538
There are two of them?

153
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:29,074
Wait a minute.
It might be a real courier service.

154
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,443
It's a matter of how to figure out
if they're legit.

155
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,245
That's easy.

156
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,848
We fire a shot.
The one that runs is the one we want.

157
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,250
This is the first time I agree with you.

158
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,452
You guys.

159
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,825
What are you gonna do
if they're both real?

160
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:53,399
<i>They both ran?</i>

161
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,101
<i>We didn't consider that option.</i>

162
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:02,074
- I'm trusting you with that one.
- I have to pay them back for yesterday.

163
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:21,560
Forgive us.

164
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:24,463
We'll pay the parking fee.

165
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,202
This way?

166
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,072
<i>Spike. Draw them out.</i>

167
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,075
<i>It'll be a mess
if they let the virus go in there.</i>

168
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,009
<i>I know.</i>

169
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,416
So, let's see what you got.

170
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,321
He's here.

171
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:50,589
Waste of time.

172
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,502
He's after the arm.

173
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,504
He's not taking us seriously. Ruth.

174
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,106
Ready to go anytime.

175
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,209
Take that!

176
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,445
Welcome.

177
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:18,050
Excellent.

178
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:22,688
Bingo!

179
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,059
He's holding up pretty well.

180
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,603
- Cut off the MONO system!
- I'm doing it!

181
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,978
That idiot cut off his MONO system.

182
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,179
Hey, George.

183
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,481
And he's in Earth's gravitational field.

184
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,023
Old man! Here, here!

185
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:00,959
- This is pretty bad!
<i>- Align the D7. You did it before, right?</i>

186
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,194
<i>Like I remember.</i>

187
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,363
No good. There's nothing we can do.

188
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,502
You idiot.
Hurry up and do something about this.

189
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:13,305
Damn it. Move! Move!

190
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,641
Falling! We're falling!

191
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,213
Spike, I'll be right there.

192
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,716
<i>I'm calculating an interception course.</i>

193
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,418
<i>Until then, somehow keep control manually.</i>

194
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:30,222
<i>Even if everything was normal,
it'd be tough to get out of here.</i>

195
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,158
I can see that.

196
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,998
And I just had it overhauled.

197
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,305
Oh, well. Whatever happens happens.

198
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:57,383
<i>Spike, above you.</i>

199
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,320
Your tattered ship looks like a goddess.

200
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,101
Shit, the virus.

201
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,240
- Spike!
<i>- I'm still alive.</i>

202
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,041
<i>We have to start over.</i>

203
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,551
No way. Old man, you gotta be kidding.

204
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,421
Are you really gonna move
this ancient piece of...?

205
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,589
Do you think I'd do this as a joke?

206
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:46,065
Don't just stand there.
Hurry up and get me some fuel.

207
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:47,332
All right.

208
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:51,270
Spike, can you hear me?
I got a calculation.

209
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,339
It'll take another seven hours
for us to rendezvous.

210
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,708
Come on, you're joking, right?

211
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:00,846
<i>We're too close to Earth.
The orbital paths I can take are limited.</i>

212
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,182
Isn't there a way for you
to just swing on by?

213
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,084
<i>If I plunge in at this angle,</i>

214
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,653
<i>both The Bebop and the Swordfish
will burn to nothing.</i>

215
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:25,737
Jet.

216
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,775
<i>I have some booze hidden
behind the fridge.</i>

217
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:31,643
<i>Feel free to drink some.</i>

218
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:33,545
Something wrong?

219
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,549
I'm out of gas. Nothing I can do now.

220
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:42,321
<i>How about I go there and tow you back,
in exchange for that booze?</i>

221
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:47,226
I heard the conversation.
Give me the Swordfish's coordinates.

222
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,395
Doohan? How the hell do you...?

223
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:16,522
<i>Spike, I don't care how you do it,
but slow down using an air brake.</i>

224
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:17,456
Slow down?

225
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:20,259
If you slow down
within Earth's atmosphere,

226
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,794
the gravitational pull
will accelerate you instead,

227
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,597
<i>which will give you enough speed
to escape.</i>

228
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:28,400
<i>However, you have to maintain the ship
at a certain angle.</i>

229
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,870
<i>Too far either way, and you'll be thrown
to the other end of the universe.</i>

230
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,406
Unfortunately,
I'm not one for delicate controls.

231
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,441
<i>Spike...</i>

232
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,244
I know you can do it.

233
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,381
I didn't give you the Swordfish
for nothing.

234
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,753
Don't you start crashing, either.

235
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,404
Maximum propulsion.

236
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,974
You didn't have to force yourself
to come with me.

237
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,544
You know how Blue Sox fans
love to party.

238
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,382
- Let's go.
- All right.

239
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:41,673
We're flying.

240
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,244
We're really flying.

241
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,389
<i>Lower the nose by 0.6 degrees.</i>

242
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:06,965
<i>You're in too deep.</i>

243
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,567
<i>Spike, you'll burn to a crisp.</i>

244
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:15,941
<i>This is the last chance.</i>

245
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,764
It went in. It went in! That was perfect!

246
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,401
Doohan, you saved me.

247
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,568
<i>Not quite.</i>

248
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:46,004
Most of the heat-resistant tiles
have peeled off.

249
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:47,539
The temperature is rising.

250
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,975
<i>The landing gear isn't coming down.</i>

251
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,877
<i>Oh yeah, and the 2 nozzle won't work.</i>

252
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,913
<i>What?! Is that for real?!
What are we gonna do?!</i>

253
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:59,084
<i>- We can't land without them!</i>
- Oh, well. Whatever happens happens.

254
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:02,754
<i>I knew I shouldn't have come up here!
I'm still too young to die!</i>

255
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:39,057
<i>Too much time has passed by</i>

256
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:43,962
<i>To lament that we were deeply in love</i>

257
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:51,002
<i>The wind keeps blowing, while my heart</i>

258
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:56,608
<i>Cannot heal all the tears in it</i>

259
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:05,584
<i>Someone cry for me with parched eyes.</i>

260
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,124
<i>The real folk blues</i>

261
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,861
<i>I only want to know</i>

262
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:20,832
<i>What true sadness is</i>

263
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,835
<i>Sitting in muddy water</i>

264
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,072
<i>Isn't such a bad life</i>

265
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:35,547
<i>If it ends</i>

266
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:41,586
<i>After the first time</i>

267
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,864
<i>Next episode: "Pierrot le Fou."</i>
