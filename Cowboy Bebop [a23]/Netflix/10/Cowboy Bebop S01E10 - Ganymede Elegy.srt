1
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,472
Shut up!

2
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:22,308
What...?

3
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,317
Hey, Jet.

4
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,787
I'm asking you,
how much longer before we land?

5
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,459
How long you been standing there?

6
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,961
I've been here for a while.

7
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,462
I see.

8
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:17,897
What are you spacing out about?

9
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,733
Where's my bounty?

10
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:24,437
Can't you land quickly, so I can
hand over that musty-looking fugitive?

11
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,474
What, you haven't
even gotten permission to land yet?

12
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,878
I know. You guys are so obnoxious.

13
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:36,649
Don't rush so much.
And take care of the airport end for me.

14
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,255
I thought Ganymede was your homeland.

15
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:46,659
Were you perhaps thinking about some
woman in the past that cried over you?

16
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,867
Or perhaps a woman that made you cry.

17
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:55,802
Didn't you hear me

18
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,870
- when I said you're being obnoxious?
- <i>Yes.</i>

19
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,974
<i>This is Ganymede police.</i>

20
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,477
Donelly?

21
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,779
<i>Oh, Jet! Jet, it's you!</i>

22
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,315
<i>There is no mistake.</i>

23
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,484
<i>The top of your head's
gotten rather lonely,</i>

24
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:12,852
<i>but it's still Jet, all right.</i>

25
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,788
Long time no see, Donelly.

26
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:19,525
<i>I'm surprised that you're
working around here. Has it been...</i>

27
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,961
<i>Seven years? Eight?</i>

28
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,931
<i>What the hell's up with you
to come back so suddenly?</i>

29
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,500
I wanna hand over a bounty.

30
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,671
Wanted ad number EX41285.
Baker Panchorero.

31
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,742
<i>To think you're a bounty hunter...</i>

32
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,646
<i>You, who was called the Black Dog,</i>

33
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,415
<i>a mad dog that never let go
of things bitten into?</i>

34
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,752
I thought you had already retired.

35
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:49,022
<i>Hey, I'm still an active officer!</i>

36
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,592
<i>Don't judge things on your time scale,
you Rip Van Winkle you.</i>

37
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:56,929
- He used to be a cop? That explains...
- That example is completely reversed!

38
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,798
- What?
- <i>I'm glad you're still kicking.</i>

39
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,401
- Why I don't get along with him.
- Yeah, you, too.

40
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,903
<i>Oh, yeah... what was her name...?</i>

41
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,072
<i>You know...</i>

42
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:08,041
<i>I know! Alisa!</i>

43
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:20,720
<i>She's got a little joint
in the port of Marvis.</i>

44
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,790
<i>A small bar called La Fin.</i>

45
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,995
<i>But in this recession,
I hear she's got a lot of debts to pay.</i>

46
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:35,034
<i>I'm sure there are a lot of problems
for a woman trying to live alone.</i>

47
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,119
Sense of justice and duty, huh?

48
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,522
First time in a while he's home,
of course he's gonna go visit.

49
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:34,127
You're totally wrong if you think
your old woman still thinks about you.

50
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:39,999
You're totally wrong yourself if you
think every other woman thinks like you.

51
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,702
Justice and duty, duty, three o'clock tea!

52
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,672
Really, men...

53
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,914
are hopeless romantics.

54
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,686
Hey, why are you rubbing that stuff on?

55
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:06,826
Beautiful skin is maintained
by continued effort that seems futile.

56
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,094
Do you understand?

57
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,000
I know! Futile! Useless!

58
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:32,752
This is...

59
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,021
La Fin, right?

60
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,624
Yeah... and you are?

61
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:41,994
An old friend.

62
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,964
I was in the area
for the first time in a while.

63
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,134
Alisa... isn't here.

64
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:50,736
Jet?

65
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,507
That can't be...

66
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:55,875
Are you really Jet?

67
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:01,981
Rhint, he is my guest.

68
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:03,649
It's all right.

69
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:10,623
You don't mind?

70
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:11,991
I don't.

71
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:16,262
Anyway... How about it?
You want a glass, right?

72
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,037
You're my last customer.

73
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:27,773
I'm closing shop.

74
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,711
The number of ships decreased,
and this area has gotten desolate.

75
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:34,146
I'm thinking of moving to a new town.

76
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,149
Are you all right?

77
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,986
On the new island cities,

78
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:44,023
a mortgage is expensive.
Are you able to manage all that?

79
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,630
That's so like you
to worry about such things.

80
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:54,133
I'm planning to change myself
in the new town.

81
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,135
Don't worry.

82
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:57,837
Rhint is here with me.

83
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,076
- That guy that was just here?
- Something on your mind?

84
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:06,779
Yeah.

85
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,148
To tell the truth,
I already have three kids.

86
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,586
I'm just kidding. It was a joke.

87
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,988
Rhint is just my boyfriend.

88
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,824
How are you doing?

89
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,626
Have you gotten married yet?

90
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,162
I live and wander with a group of weirdos.

91
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,832
And on top of it, I'm a bounty hunter now.

92
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:37,910
Do you remember?

93
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,218
<i>Where's Jet?</i>

94
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,054
Doing personal stuff.

95
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,856
<i>You're his partner, right?</i>

96
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:51,791
Yeah.

97
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,894
<i>I've got news on a bounty,</i>

98
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,297
<i>This hasn't been publicly broadcast yet.</i>

99
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,836
<i>Rhint Celonius.</i>

100
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,772
<i>A thug in the port of Marvis.</i>

101
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,909
<i>Last night he contacted
financial broker Law Rentzuo.</i>

102
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,345
<i>This guy was another tough guy...</i>

103
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:14,880
<i>but he was killed.</i>

104
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:16,749
And so?

105
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,986
<i>Rhint... is Alisa's gigolo.</i>

106
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,823
<i>I thought I'd warn you guys.</i>

107
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,160
And how much is the bounty?

108
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:37,096
Back then...
when I got home from work...

109
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,265
you always waited for me.

110
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,735
That was all I needed.

111
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,207
But that day...

112
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,216
When I came home,
only that watch was left...

113
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:02,388
and a small note with one word:
"Farewell."

114
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:09,128
For some reason, I didn't feel sad.

115
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:13,499
It just lacked reality.

116
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:21,040
And I gradually felt something
inside me go numb.

117
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,779
After six months,
I made a bet with myself.

118
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:32,118
That I would leave this planet
if you didn't return...

119
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:36,021
by the time this clock stopped.

120
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,025
I didn't come here to blame you.

121
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,162
I just wanted to know...

122
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:48,033
why you disappeared back then.

123
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:56,509
You seem to think that time
on Ganymede had stopped.

124
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,081
That's a story from long ago.

125
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,052
I've... forgotten it.

126
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,025
I don't need time that stands still.

127
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,163
Farewell, Jet.

128
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:25,130
A bounty hunter? Then can he be...?

129
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:27,566
Rhint...

130
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,268
He's after me.

131
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,571
I have a bounty on my head.

132
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,508
It's all over!

133
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,046
It's not your fault.

134
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,950
It's because I borrowed money
from a guy like him...

135
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,921
and you protected me.

136
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,323
I can't be saved if I get caught.

137
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:53,459
I...

138
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,495
killed a guy.

139
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,266
Let's get out of here.

140
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,236
Let's get out of here, just the two of us.

141
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,436
This must be because I have good karma.

142
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:43,709
Sorry, but it's business.

143
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,460
Steer for me, please!

144
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,197
<i>Hey, what's wrong?</i>

145
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,632
I'm after a bounty worth 1.8 million.

146
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,502
- <i>What?
- Here, I'll send it to you.</i>

147
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,772
He's a bounty?

148
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,410
<i>Yeah, a secret bit of info from Donelly.
He apparently killed a loan shark.</i>

149
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,147
Damn it!

150
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,055
<i>I'll do this. You can go back.</i>

151
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,326
You're not gonna let him go, are you?

152
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,396
<i>This is the land where I was a cop.</i>

153
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,766
I'm the Black Dog.
Once I bite, I never let go.

154
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,504
I have no regrets about her,

155
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,539
but I'll settle this score
on my home turf.

156
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,576
Sense of justice and duty, huh...

157
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,250
<i>Can you hear me...?</i>

158
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,685
<i>Stop the boat now!</i>

159
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,221
Jet?

160
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:44,249
Stay away!

161
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,887
Please, let us go!

162
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,228
There are other bounties to find.

163
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,197
Even if I let you go...

164
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,434
someone will come for you someday.

165
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,803
If you run,
you will become an accomplice.

166
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:05,938
Stay away!

167
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,207
You still have time.

168
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:10,909
Don't worry about me anymore!

169
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:26,892
You were like this back then, too.

170
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,495
You decided everything.

171
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,831
And you were always right.

172
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,769
When I was with you,
I never had to do anything.

173
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:43,408
All I had to do was hang on to your arm
like a child, with no cares in the world.

174
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,815
I wanted to decide how
to live my life by myself.

175
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,419
Even if that was a mistake.

176
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:15,374
Let go!
I don't wanna go to prison! Let go!

177
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,377
Help! Help me, please!

178
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,618
Be strong...

179
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,322
and protect her.

180
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,006
Self-defense seems to be how they see it.

181
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,513
What are you going to do now?

182
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:56,915
I won't be going anywhere anymore.

183
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,720
I will wait in my store... for Rhint.

184
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:04,690
It won't take long...

185
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,826
because time is flowing along.

186
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,884
<i>An unseen terror assaults the</i> Bebop <i>crew.</i>

187
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:17,556
<i>Caught by the venomous fangs
of the unseen enemy, another victim falls.</i>

188
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:23,094
<i>What is the identity of the fearsome enemy
that refuses to show itself?</i>

189
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:29,067
<i>A symphony of shivers that will send you
into the deepest trenches of terror.</i>

190
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:32,604
<i>Next episode: "Toys in the Attic."</i>

191
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:37,509
<i>Once the channel is set,
you will no longer be able to escape.</i>
