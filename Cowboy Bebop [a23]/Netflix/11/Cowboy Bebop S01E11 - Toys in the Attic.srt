00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:04,757
<i>Space travel log 0968.</i>

2
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:11,231
<i>It sounds good to call the bounty-hunting
job a "freelance" job...</i>

3
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:15,702
<i>but all that means
is that we're self-employed.</i>

4
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:18,571
<i>When we have no jobs,
we have none at all.</i>

5
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,474
<i>Well, that's all a part of our destiny...</i>

6
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,277
<i>but it's troublesome
that we're out of money,</i>

7
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:29,482
{\an8}<i>And so, we get urges
to make quick cash.</i>

8
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,623
Any problem with using these?

9
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,363
Evens!

10
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,166
Evens, is it?

11
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:49,936
No, odds after all!

12
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,675
Odds, is it?

13
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,944
Yeah odds.

14
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,849
Double ace Even.

15
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,468
I can't eat any more

16
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:27,574
Well, it would be easiest for me
if you paid up in cash.

17
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:29,742
So, what'll it be?

18
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,347
A man does not take back his word!

19
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:43,856
That's why I told you not to do it

20
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:18,524
<i>Humans were meant to work
and sweat for their money after all.</i>

21
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,660
<i>Those that try to get rich quick...</i>

22
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:24,497
<i>or live at the expense of others...</i>

23
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:27,500
<i>all get divine retribution
somewhere along the way.</i>

24
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,969
<i>That is the lesson.</i>

25
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,538
<i>But one thing about humans</i>

26
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:35,341
<i>is that they quickly forget
the lessons they just learned.</i>

27
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,379
Damn it.

28
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:46,519
There was a fridge way back here?

29
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,033
<i>"Survival of the fittest"
is the law of the land.</i>

30
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,603
<i>To fool and to be fooled
is the reason we live.</i>

31
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,573
<i>I've never had anything good
happen to me when I trust others.</i>

32
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,575
<i>That's the lesson.</i>

33
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:17,817
How much did you swindle?

34
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,753
Would you stop saying things
that would hurt my reputation?

35
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,088
He lost on his own!

36
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,590
Because he couldn't see
through this cheat?

37
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,696
It's part of one's skill
to see through it.

38
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,698
At least give his clothes back to him.

39
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,066
I'll lend them to him.

40
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:34,701
Greedy, aren't we?

41
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,403
It's rough out there in the real world.

42
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,748
Hey, what's up?

43
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,684
Something bit me.

44
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,352
What do you mean, "something"?

45
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,900
It wasn't a rat!

46
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,036
Look at this! This wound on my neck!

47
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:11,370
Hey!

48
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,906
This is silly. It was a waste
of time running over here.

49
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:17,110
Spike! I was bitten around that fridge!

50
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:18,911
Fridge?

51
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,447
You have a clue?

52
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,618
I'm sure there was something.

53
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:27,887
Nope, can't remember.

54
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,848
You sure this is gonna work?

55
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:58,651
The only thing it doesn't work on
are myopia and cavities.

56
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,887
- Then it works on athlete's foot?
- Of course.

57
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:04,791
Don't you have something more
legit that would get rid of sores?

58
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:05,758
That would be this.

59
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,529
- That gets rid of sores?
- Yeah.

60
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,865
Crush this, and you boil it
in three cups of water until

61
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,201
the liquid simmers down
to 1 cup, and you drink it.

62
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:19,906
Spike, isn't there something
more different?

63
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,207
Oh, I got just the thing.

64
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,608
Yeah, give me that.

65
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,845
Give me what you had before.

66
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,590
Hey I'm feeling a lot sicker now.

67
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,826
Do I look pale?

68
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,094
You're pretty pale to begin with.

69
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,665
What is this awful smell?

70
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,601
- Herbal medicine.
- Herbal medicine? This?

71
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:52,939
It smells like you just left a rag
that cleaned up spilt milk out to dry!

72
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:56,209
I think it's more like rotten soybeans.

73
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,978
Knock it off!
I have to drink this, you know!

74
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,022
Oh, brother.

75
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,725
Hey, now, this goes too far for a joke.

76
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,047
It was a rat, right?

77
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,116
There's nothing to make a fuss about.

78
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:39,752
Am I wrong?

79
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,853
I have no clue.

80
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:44,257
He seems to have gotten some poison
that's not in this database.

81
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,226
Looking at similar poisons.

82
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,228
{\an8}Cryptosporidium.

83
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,230
That's not it.

84
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,900
Cholera?

85
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,902
Nope

86
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,704
Ebola virus?

87
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,640
Nope.

88
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,041
{\an8}Bifidobacterium?

89
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,310
Not even close.

90
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,312
What is it?

91
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,281
Ein, you're being noisy.

92
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,217
I can say for sure
that it wasn't an ordinary rat.

93
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,119
Hey, keep it quiet.

94
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:14,921
So, what is it?

95
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:15,988
Well, it's...

96
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,723
A mysterious space creature!

97
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,994
Spooky! The attack
of a horrible space creature!

98
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,165
Oh, yeah, there's that possibility.

99
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,135
Yeah, right.

100
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:30,636
Then what is it?

101
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,638
It's not in the database.

102
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:35,308
- Yeah.
- These base-pairs are weird, too.

103
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:37,109
You think so?

104
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,612
We've never seen symptoms
like this before either.

105
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,882
Other than a space creature,
what is it? What is it?

106
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:49,155
Well, perhaps something like
a rat went through a mutation...

107
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,857
and evolved into
some mysterious creature

108
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,127
and carried a mysterious poison.

109
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:56,796
What's that about?

110
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,999
That isn't too different from the
"mysterious space creature" theory!

111
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,200
This is too silly.

112
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,204
Aiya, what are we gonna do, Ein?

113
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,073
It's a space creature!

114
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:10,676
It's spooky!

115
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:48,714
All right. This is made
to sense heat sources.

116
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,785
It's usually used
to find bounties that are hiding.

117
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:54,687
Can you see me?

118
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,964
All right, I'm gonna test it,
so move just like I tell you.

119
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,434
Ein! Where are you going?

120
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:09,368
Hey, wait!

121
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:10,436
Hey!

122
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,975
That's weird. Is it broken?

123
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,081
Was that response from you?

124
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,885
That story you were telling, about some
mysterious creature or something.

125
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:28,454
- Oh, yeah.
- What happens if you're bitten?

126
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:33,225
I can't say for sure until we catch
the creature, but I'm going to guess...

127
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,094
death?

128
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,999
No, why did it have to be this way?

129
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,868
I still have a lot to live for.

130
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,773
I haven't committed any crimes.

131
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:51,944
I'm still young and lively.

132
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:53,446
Lively?

133
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,016
Oh, poor little me!

134
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,985
Hey, now, why are you getting into this?

135
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,979
<i>August 6th. Skyday.</i>

136
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:30,950
<i>Today, we will go look for the spooky,
mysterious space creature.</i>

137
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:36,489
<i>Lesson, lesson if you see
a stranger, follow him!</i>

138
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,395
Are you here?

139
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,532
Are you here, Mr. Spooky Creature?

140
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:50,469
Ed! Ein!

141
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,239
Hey! This isn't hide-and-seek!

142
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:01,046
Exploration, experimentation, exclamation.

143
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,383
Lights shine bright in the many towns.

144
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:08,521
I will come back alive.
I trust you, Ed.

145
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:19,999
Ein!

146
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,567
Are you in here?

147
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,068
You're not in here?

148
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:24,570
Answer me!

149
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,138
Really...

150
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,321
Ein, Ed What happened?

151
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,269
Ein!

152
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,539
Hey, hang in there!

153
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,107
Where's Ed?

154
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:06,145
I can't believe it got you this easily.
You're a dog! Where are your instincts?!

155
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,129
No choice. Guess I'm going in!

156
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:15,014
{\an8}<i>Cruising down Route 66.</i>

157
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:18,617
<i>Approximate cruising time left: 82 hours.</i>

158
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,589
<i>From here, we will enter full autopilot.</i>

159
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,294
<i>After passing the gate, this ship
will automatically land on Mars.</i>

160
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,698
<i>The route cannot be changed
after confirmation.</i>

161
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:13,172
Ed! You aren't here, are you? Hey!

162
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,047
Did that thing get her, too?

163
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,582
Don't surprise me!

164
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:07,793
I've been waiting for you!

165
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:17,736
Excellent!

166
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,378
Come on, you slime!

167
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,117
Got him!

168
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:24,770
This thing seems familiar.

169
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,443
I guess I should have eaten that.

170
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,812
Oh, yeah, it should be in the fridge.

171
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,187
<i>That was when I remembered everything.</i>

172
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,756
<i>It was, oh, one year ago.</i>

173
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:49,795
<i>When I'd gotten a hold of a real lobster,
I hid it in the fridge in this stockroom.</i>

174
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:53,599
<i>Just so nobody else would eat it.</i>

175
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:58,303
<i>But I had forgotten about it,
and left it in there for a whole year.</i>

176
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,441
<i>I wonder what it looks like in there now.</i>

177
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:05,604
Shit!

178
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,575
Damn it!

179
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:23,849
<i>You shouldn't leave things in the fridge.</i>

180
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,386
<i>That is the lesson.</i>

181
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,569
Sweet bean roll!

182
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,777
Can't eat anymore.

183
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:13,051
<i>And so they all passed away.</i>

184
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:18,156
<i>Everyone, it was brief,
but thanks for your support.</i>

185
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,559
<i>This was the last episode.</i>

186
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:22,661
<i>I hope they rest in peace.</i>

187
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,095
<i>Amen.</i>

188
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:28,200
<i>And starting next episode,
we bring you "Cowgirl Ed"!</i>

189
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,168
<i>I'm the main character!</i>

190
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:31,169
Hey, wait a minute!

191
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,971
What kind of selfish crap is that?!

192
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,640
<i>Next episode: Jupiter Jazz, part 1.</i>

193
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,108
<i>There really is another episode!</i>
