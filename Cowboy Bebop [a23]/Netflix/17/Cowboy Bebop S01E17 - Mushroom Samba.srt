1
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:49,109
This was the most
special of the special.

2
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,811
It was an emergency ration
for true emergencies.

3
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,314
that was saved for the
last of the last resorts.

4
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:59,786
All I'm asking is who ate this.

5
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,188
Grudges over food sure are scary.

6
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:05,758
Spike, by perchance, was it you?

7
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:08,661
If I was the culprit, I wouldn't leave
the empty box lying around like that.

8
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,597
Ed is hungry.

9
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,565
Maybe you ate it yourself,
but are pretending

10
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:15,235
to be upset because
we found the empty box?

11
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,269
What?!

12
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,607
We haven't had anything to
eat for two whole days!!

13
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,176
{\an8}Don't you call a situation
like this an emergency?!

14
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,378
I wanna eat stuff like
fried beef noodles...

15
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,447
{\an8}We're out of gas!
We can't do anything about it!

16
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,449
If you could hold out
like this a bit longer,

17
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,851
we'll reach Europa soon
thanks to inertia.

18
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,353
Tummy's caving in!

19
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:36,723
If only we could use that
energy to propel ourselves...

20
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:40,393
You keep mouthing off like that and
I'll toss you out into absolute zero.

21
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:42,595
And a stir-fry of liver and
chives would be good, too...

22
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:43,596
Sounds good.

23
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,900
At least it's better than aimlessly
floating around this place.

24
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,193
That was some collision...

25
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,363
Hey! Can you hear me?
Answer me! Hey!!

26
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:30,910
Isn't this...

27
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,246
a hit-and-run?!

28
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:40,286
This is bad! The shock from that
collision changed our trajectory!

29
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:41,321
What did what to who?

30
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,622
What's going on?!

31
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,430
Wow... Where is this place?

32
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,498
This is so uncivilized!

33
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:26,833
I don't think that's our problem...

34
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,469
We have to start by checking the ship.

35
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,004
Can you go get some food?

36
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,807
What?

37
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,777
I suddenly feel... a stabbing pain...

38
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,579
What are you trying to pull?

39
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,720
This expired a year ago...

40
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,889
I'm glad I didn't eat it.

41
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:53,526
Serves you right.
This is divine retribution!

42
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,698
Let's get to it...

43
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,611
Whatcha gonna do?

44
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,713
Ed will help, too!

45
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,354
We're fine here, so go outside
and find us some food.

46
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,922
Okay!

47
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,896
Gotta wear my socks

48
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:33,466
to go out, to go out...

49
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,864
Nothing here...

50
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,674
It's that hit-and-run ship!

51
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:18,077
Wait, wait!!

52
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,815
Wait, wait!!!

53
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,153
Smell...

54
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,156
Smell... food...

55
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,639
Food!

56
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,710
Give me!

57
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,678
1,000 woolongs each, including tax.

58
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:56,983
Cash only. No money cards
or cash cards allowed.

59
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,618
I don't have money.

60
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:01,020
Then hurry home, kid.

61
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:10,963
Can I have one?

62
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:15,735
1,000 woolongs each.
Cash only. Cards are...

63
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,939
Kid, no use staring.

64
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,543
If you want food,
go someplace like the town.

65
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,745
I don't need change.

66
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,079
In exchange...

67
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,082
If you see this man, give me a call.

68
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,717
Thanks!

69
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:17,930
Excuse us.

70
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:20,500
We would like to check your baggage.

71
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,734
Something wrong?

72
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,904
Apparently, a broker on
the wanted list

73
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,039
for illegal mushroom sales
made a getaway to this town.

74
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,674
What a coincidence.

75
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:31,644
I'm after that bounty as well.

76
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,012
A cowboy?

77
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,780
We're gonna check out your trunk.

78
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,582
Go ahead, feel free.

79
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:41,654
Hey!

80
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:42,788
All right! Freeze!

81
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,857
- Now, wait a minute...
- All right, stay still...

82
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,593
- I don't know anything about this!
- Turn around! Hands on the ground!

83
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,695
- What are you doing?!
- Now put your hands on the ground!

84
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,297
- Let go of me!!
- Hurry up!

85
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:55,835
Food, food, do you have any?

86
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:59,872
Oh, you don't? Oh, you do?

87
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,642
Boy, am I hungry...

88
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,055
Meanie!

89
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,256
What?

90
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,157
Give me!

91
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,293
Give me something!

92
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,662
Damn it, stop hanging all over me!

93
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:23,963
Hey!

94
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:28,935
I won't let you tell me you
forgot who I am, Domino!

95
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:29,835
Let's see...

96
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:31,203
Come on! Remember, damn it!

97
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:34,774
I'm the younger of the Shaft brothers
that bought mushrooms from you!

98
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,742
I really can't recall...

99
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:41,914
You do want to know why I drag an
empty coffin around like this, don't you?

100
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:43,916
It's because...

101
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,619
I'm going to go home after
putting your corpse inside--

102
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,258
Pieces... All in pieces!

103
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,693
What was what to who?

104
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:58,264
My big bro ate a mushroom
he bought from you,

105
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,634
and laughed and laughed,
and twisted his intestines to death!

106
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,269
A happy way to die.

107
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,271
Shut up!

108
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,773
Speaking of which,
it's all your fault!

109
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,775
That's what I call
an unjust resentment!

110
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,344
Ed is hungry, too!

111
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,245
Take this!

112
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:18,184
Wait, you bastard! Damn it!

113
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:19,819
Food!

114
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,057
Don't, Ein! We have to share!

115
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,334
Ein?

116
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,109
Bad mushroom?

117
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,831
This for real?

118
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,674
Delicious!

119
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:28,154
This really can't be happening.

120
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,324
Really...

121
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,894
This really has no way of happening.

122
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:14,560
Hey... You know, the world
really is a great place...

123
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,799
Did I just say something?

124
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:28,941
Hey, mister.

125
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:35,314
This is a stairway to heaven.
You know that, right?

126
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,117
An obnoxious little frog...

127
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,290
I don't care anymore.
I warned you!

128
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,921
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

129
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:18,991
I now know the secrets of the universe.

130
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,530
By the way...

131
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,498
who was I?

132
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:31,103
So, these mushrooms are
inedible after all...

133
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,144
<i>So, as you can tell, it's time
for another episode of Big Shot!</i>

134
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:42,448
<i>We'll introduce you to more
and more bounties this week!</i>

135
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,950
{\an8}<i>So, batting first for us today</i>

136
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,619
{\an8}<i>is this man, Domino Walker.</i>

137
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,288
{\an8}<i>He's currently wanted for
selling illegal mushrooms.</i>

138
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,924
{\an8}- That's the guy we just saw!
- <i>The bounty is a conservative 1.2 mil.</i>

139
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,926
That's cowgirl, Ein.

140
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:57,296
We earn money, and buy food!

141
00:14:57,596 --> 00:15:00,165
Ein, you're a cow-woofwoof!

142
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:09,575
Here we go!

143
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,476
One!

144
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,377
Two!

145
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,244
Five!

146
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,245
Four!

147
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,513
Hello!

148
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,990
Hey, don't underestimate the police!

149
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,959
I really don't know anything!

150
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,030
Then why did you have a strange kid
and a dog in the trunk of your car?!

151
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,433
Hello... Yes?

152
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,037
Oh, it's you, Sally.
Really... You're so hopeless...

153
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,006
I told you so many times
not to call me at work...

154
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,646
And? Yeah, yeah, and that's it?

155
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:50,282
I mean, I didn't mean it that
way when I said "that's it?"...

156
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,052
Yeah, yeah, like that.
I love you, Sally.

157
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,221
Got it. Tonight at 7 it is. Bye-bye!

158
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,461
Hey!

159
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,001
What's wrong, young'un?
Lookin' like that...

160
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,403
Did your woman run off without you?

161
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,404
What to say...

162
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:15,174
None of your business, old geezers.

163
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,451
Oh, man... that's for
eating all at once.

164
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:28,053
They say when you're in
a hurry, go around.

165
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:29,288
Is that right?

166
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,663
He's not here...

167
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,704
That hit-and-run ship!

168
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:55,381
I'm sure they never even dreamed
that I was raising these in here.

169
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,650
This one's bad.

170
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:03,222
Well, making an emergency landing here
was the only miscalculation I had.

171
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,289
Were you surprised?

172
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,358
I was.

173
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,227
What the hell are you guys?

174
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,495
Why are you here?

175
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,330
That's my line!

176
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,031
How did you get in here
in the first place?

177
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:14,233
- The door was open.
- Is that so?!

178
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:17,202
Culprit of the hit-and-run,
prepare to get arrested!

179
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,405
Stink bug gas!

180
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,580
Wait, wait, wait!

181
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,533
Don't think that you
can get away from me!

182
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:31,877
Don't get in my way!

183
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,205
Ein! Growl!

184
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,480
C-- Come on! Let go of me!

185
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,671
Boo!

186
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:48,187
Gotcha!

187
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,521
W-- Wait...

188
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,658
T-- These mushrooms are
worth 100,000 each.

189
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,726
Let me go, and I'll give them to you.

190
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,794
Why?

191
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,930
Think about which one is worth more.

192
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,464
I don't know.

193
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:01,333
A-- Are you an idiot?!

194
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,268
Take the mushrooms!

195
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:04,736
Okay!

196
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,676
Thanks.

197
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,544
Oh, it's no problem.

198
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,766
Yahoo! Dinner! Mushroom!

199
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,736
100,000 each? Really?

200
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,372
That sure would make some money.

201
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:41,940
These are real?

202
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,375
Excuse me.

203
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:47,913
I'm with the police.

204
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,483
I want to ask a few questions about
Domino, an illegal mushroom dealer.

205
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,321
Unfortunately, we have no clue.

206
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,557
I'm so sorry we can't be of any help.

207
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,459
Ed knows who that--!

208
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,762
Don't mind her...

209
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,564
In exchange, I got--!

210
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:09,001
- Really...
- She's a troublesome kid...

211
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,642
Excuse me, sir.

212
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:30,455
They're okay.

213
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,493
He must really like shiitake mushrooms.

214
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,029
Well, sorry to bother you.

215
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,601
Here's dinner.

216
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:43,669
What's the menu?

217
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:50,976
Shiitake stir-fry, shiitake stew,
shiitake salad, and a shiitake dessert.

218
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,347
Again? How many days has it been?

219
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,349
No... I can't eat anymore.

220
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,786
Quit complaining, and be
thankful that we can even eat!

221
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:01,920
Thankful!

222
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:27,779
<i>Too much time has passed by</i>

223
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:32,684
<i>To lament that we were deeply in love</i>

224
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:39,725
<i>The wind keeps blowing, while my heart</i>

225
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:45,130
<i>Cannot heal all the tears in it</i>

226
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:54,106
<i>Someone cry for me with parched eyes.</i>

227
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:00,846
<i>The real folk blues</i>

228
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,583
<i>I only want to know</i>

229
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:09,554
<i>What true sadness is</i>

230
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,557
<i>Sitting in muddy water</i>

231
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,794
<i>Isn't such a bad life</i>

232
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:24,069
<i>If it ends</i>

233
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:30,108
<i>After the first time</i>

234
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:51,930
<i>A videotape that was delivered to
the Bebop with no return address.</i>

235
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:56,601
<i>Because we wanted to view the tape,
things took a turn for the unexpected.</i>

236
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:59,638
<i>No, actually it doesn't go anywhere.</i>

237
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,807
<i>At first glance,
the story is pointless,</i>

238
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,509
<i>the actions are on a small scale,</i>

239
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,444
<i>and the ending is forced...</i>

240
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:08,180
<i>but what will you get out of it all?</i>

241
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,850
<i>Next episode: Speak like a Child.</i>

242
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,853
<i>At first glance, it's interesting.</i>
