1
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,528
Such pretty eyes.

2
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,464
You have pretty eyes
and a smile to match.

3
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,402
Looking to score riches?

4
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,373
I welcome all.

5
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:30,717
You know the first rule in combat?

6
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,399
To get the first attack.

7
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,786
What an extended greeting this is.

8
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,500
I didn't know that the
sure-shot and master of poker,

9
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:27,273
the legendary female gambler
Poker Alice was still alive.

10
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,277
If she was still alive,
she'd be 219 years old now.

11
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:35,915
Of course.
You sure don't look over 200.

12
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,622
Besides, Alice never
lost during her lifetime.

13
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,625
She kept winning, without cheating.

14
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,894
You have a way to prove that?

15
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,599
I hear you are carrying a large debt.

16
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:58,238
Which do you prefer,
the police, or my establishment?

17
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,363
A prophecy?

18
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:28,434
Charlie said,
"Only hands can wash hands.

19
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,371
If you want to receive,
you must first give."

20
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:35,975
Hey, doesn't that mean that Charlie
is telling us to just do it?

21
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:37,777
Right?

22
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,447
Do you think Charlie Parker
would quote Goethe?

23
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,916
Oh, come on, it's all part
of the dream I had.

24
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,619
The way things go,
I say even the hard-earned

25
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,721
5000 woolongs
will disappear with your dream.

26
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:50,723
Let me tell you something, Spike.

27
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,725
This is a no smoking area.

28
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:26,426
You shouldn't play.
Your eyes are too good for this.

29
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,995
They'll kick us out
if you win too much.

30
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:31,864
Then don't bring me here.

31
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:53,953
Pray, man.

32
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:05,898
I'll take one.

33
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:22,715
Small jack.

34
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:31,924
I'll play a few.

35
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,564
<i>Must be him.</i>

36
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,714
Nice, Jackie.

37
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:15,868
The target will sit at a blackjack
table, and lose at a certain point.

38
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,971
Of course, you will help him with that.

39
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:25,645
And he will hand you the last
chip he has as a dealer's chip.

40
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:27,547
And what about it?

41
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:33,519
It's something that'll make your debt as
small as one tiny second in this universe.

42
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:53,239
Last game.

43
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:58,778
I'm not lucky, nor am I nimble.

44
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:00,913
Then what are you?

45
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:02,782
Generous.

46
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,625
Blackjack.

47
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,096
You got me. I give up.

48
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,800
I'll take this as a memento.

49
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,035
Wait a minute!

50
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,804
Hold up!

51
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,281
Hey, you!
What part of you is generous?

52
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,982
This wasn't the plan I heard!

53
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,119
I thought you were supposed
to give me the last chip!

54
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:14,687
Why should I?

55
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,089
I played along with you
and your cheats!

56
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,028
Did you hear that?

57
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:23,663
Cheating!

58
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,097
Is that for real?

59
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,633
The dealer has been cheating!

60
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,850
Can you come with me to the office?

61
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,851
Why?

62
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:52,858
What do you want?

63
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,329
You piece of...!

64
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:04,370
Come on.

65
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:08,074
Does this casino
also run a fitness club?

66
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,315
It's showtime.

67
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,102
Pardon me here.

68
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,174
Spike.

69
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,419
All right.

70
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,359
- Jet.
- That's why I told you not to.

71
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,062
That's not it!
But we gotta split!

72
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,798
I haven't cashed these in yet!
Hey!

73
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:42,134
He doesn't have it. The chip is a fake.

74
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:48,841
Neither you nor your boss realize
why we cooked up this whole thing.

75
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,143
If that chip falls into police hands

76
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,245
it's all over!

77
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:57,116
Boss, we still can't find that broad.

78
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,286
Find her!
Put a reward on her if you have to!

79
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:24,276
Why is my reward for bringing you back
being trapped in here?

80
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:33,352
I see. She smells like
money to you, too, huh?

81
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,887
You have got to be kidding.

82
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,356
Jet, how much did you have?

83
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,191
Oh, 200K. Easy.

84
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,193
And who put it all to naught?

85
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,332
What, only 200K?

86
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,801
That's nothing compared to my debt.

87
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,770
Don't you think this is
a bit much for a false accusation?

88
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:55,407
Well, that mono-carrier
should sell for about 400K.

89
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:58,944
If you had just given me that chip,
we wouldn't have had a problem.

90
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,280
- Chip?
- Yeah.

91
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,386
Disgusting.

92
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,323
If you give that to Gordon,
he'll give you as much as you want.

93
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,292
Yeah, let's do that.

94
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,295
I don't know any guy named Gordon

95
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,398
nor do I want to
believe your stories.

96
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:20,900
Wait a minute!

97
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,301
Let's go, Ein.

98
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,104
Are you listening to me? Come on!

99
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,151
- It's a chip.
- Of course it's a chip.

100
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:43,055
I don't mean that kind of chip.
There's a microchip in this thing.

101
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:56,068
<i>Amigo! Leave it to us
for bounty information!</i>

102
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,137
<i>Thanks for waiting!
It's time for</i> Big Shot!

103
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,348
- This is--
<i>- So, first up this week is...?</i>

104
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,151
<i>Shame we have to hand her to police.
Doesn't look it, but</i>

105
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:15,054
{\an8}- Hey, Spike!
- <i>she's a real mean one. Faye Valentine.</i>

106
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,557
<i>The bounty is a whopping
6 million! A real deal!</i>

107
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,426
- Hey, Jet!
- <i>First come, first served.</i>

108
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,394
<i>Good luck, cowboys!</i>

109
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,898
I've been waiting for you.

110
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:29,501
<i>First off, let me tell you
that I didn't intend to run.</i>

111
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,638
I trust you. Where are you?

112
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:35,241
<i>An old fishing ship in the gate.</i>

113
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,042
<i>They have the chip.</i>

114
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,644
<i>So, hurry up and...</i>

115
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:47,186
What?

116
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,257
Well, we thought we
were being immature.

117
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:54,560
To leave a young woman
in a place like this.

118
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,363
You aren't thinking
weird thoughts, are you?

119
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:01,901
No, we thought we'd escort you to a
place more considerate of your situation.

120
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,569
Oh, and where would that be?

121
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,237
The police.

122
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,241
We're sorry that we were so cheap
earlier with the 200K bit,

123
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,643
Faye Valentine.

124
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,345
What, there's a bounty on me?

125
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:14,647
A whopping 6 million.

126
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:18,183
What, only 6 million?

127
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,186
How much are you in debt?

128
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:24,390
Come on, please!
Anywhere but the police!

129
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,992
Only the police would give us money.

130
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:31,196
My mother's last will was for me
to not be in any place for too long!

131
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:32,264
Yeah, yeah.

132
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:37,202
My family have always been Romanis,
wandering about in search of love.

133
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,007
You don't know anything, do you?
That's another term for Gypsies.

134
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:46,445
Everyone else, like you guys, with no
pride in their lives are called Gadjo.

135
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:48,380
I'm fine with being a Gadjo.

136
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:52,351
It's calling me.
The great outdoors is calling out to me.

137
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,387
- You can do all of this with the cops.
- Let's go, Jet.

138
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:59,992
Oh, fine. I won't run.
At least untie one hand!

139
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,627
I can't even go to the bathroom!

140
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,596
Man, we got one yappy woman here.

141
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:13,205
Like taking candy from a baby.

142
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,675
More like a small sacrifice
for a large reward.

143
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:21,213
As Charlie said, "If you want
to receive, you must first give."

144
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:24,983
I guess what I see in dreams is
worth something once in a while.

145
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,393
What do you think you're doing?

146
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,264
<i>I don't know who you are</i>

147
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,700
<i>but I would like the chip back.</i>

148
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:45,471
<i>I don't know who you are,
but I refuse.</i>

149
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,274
It's just a chip
that means nothing to you.

150
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:52,611
<i>Although we can sell what's
in the chip for a pretty penny.</i>

151
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:57,616
There was a decryption program
called Crypt-Breaker

152
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:01,353
that was developed by
SIT three years ago.

153
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,390
Rumors say that after its completion,
the programmer was killed,

154
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,059
and the program
went into the black market.

155
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:11,263
<i>It's a magic key
that can decode and unlock</i>

156
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:14,400
<i>almost every protection code.</i>

157
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,037
<i>But that program itself was encoded.</i>

158
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,607
So, there was a need to find
the key to open the program.

159
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:27,312
I heard rumors that both the cops and the
ISSP were parting hairs to find the key.

160
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,116
I never thought I would see it
in a place like this.

161
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,486
You're pretty good.

162
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,258
I used to work in a shady place
called the ISSP.

163
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,594
<i>I'm sure the casino
was to take attention away</i>

164
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,831
<i>from the large sum of money,
and to fool the cops.</i>

165
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,366
<i>You just chose the wrong day.</i>

166
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:51,136
<i>Of course, this thing is
useless for us as well.</i>

167
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,639
<i>It would only be proper
to give it to the cops.</i>

168
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,140
I'll pay.

169
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:59,244
<i>300 million.
No, too much. How about 30 million?</i>

170
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,481
<i>Not bad for the price
of a magic key, eh?</i>

171
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,851
All right.

172
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:30,209
<i>Okay, 6 million turns into 30 million.</i>

173
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,777
The money just keeps growing.

174
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,278
<i>Don't get caught off-guard.</i>

175
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,780
Okey-dokey.

176
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:26,732
Someone who specifies cash
up front is rare nowadays.

177
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,401
I'm an old-fashioned guy.

178
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,807
<i>All right.</i>

179
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,243
We'll both count to three.

180
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:41,613
At which point, we release
the magnetic field of the suitcase

181
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,282
<i>and send it that way.</i>

182
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:47,286
<i>- You toss the chip our way.</i>
- Okay.

183
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,488
I'm trusting you.

184
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,526
When you confirm that we got
the chip, sink that ship.

185
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,527
Roger.

186
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:56,828
Let's go.

187
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:01,633
One.

188
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:03,835
Two.

189
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,804
Three.

190
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,822
Shutters are meant to be opened!

191
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,233
What?

192
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,747
Hi, Gadjo.

193
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,416
Hey, Romani.

194
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,922
- Bye.
- Don't let her get away! Fire!

195
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,628
Shit!

196
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:10,936
Jet, let's get out of here!

197
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,704
All right!

198
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,743
Get them! Get them!
What the hell are you doing?!

199
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,330
She dropped chaff!

200
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,331
What?

201
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:40,599
Missiles are approaching!

202
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,721
That wench.

203
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,898
It's only proper to use it.

204
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:16,335
Guess we have to build up again
from square one.

205
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,676
That's cheating!

206
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,719
<i>It sucks this world is
such an unruly place.</i>

207
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:17,589
<i>Economic recession everywhere,
making kids lose their minds.</i>

208
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:20,025
<i>Come on, this isn't the time
to be reading the paper.</i>

209
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:22,727
<i>Things aboard the</i> Bebop
<i>are becoming even more unruly.</i>

210
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:24,196
<i>This is nothing.</i>

211
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,665
<i>Look at this, terrorists.</i>

212
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,467
<i>Apparently they want
to blow Ganymede up.</i>

213
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,102
<i>Environmental Protection Society?</i>

214
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:34,539
<i>Perfect. We can have them
take care of this fleabag.</i>

215
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,741
<i>Next episode: "Gateway Shuffle."</i>

216
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:38,510
<i>Man, I'm about to lose it.</i>
