1
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:46,239
Confirmed.

2
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:52,312
To our new relationship,
and our new friendship.

3
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,814
And to prosperity.

4
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:58,318
The view from here makes me sad
that I must leave so soon.

5
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:01,121
It's an amazing sight.

6
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,323
Next time, we should have dinner together.

7
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:07,193
The Cantonese cuisine
that our head chef makes

8
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:10,330
is just about as superb
as this scenery.

9
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,699
That's a wonderful invitation, however...

10
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:17,604
to think that the day that I'd dine with
an executive from the Red Dragon...

11
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:21,741
Rest assured,
the food will not be poisoned.

12
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:34,287
I can finally take a breather.

13
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,622
Thank God.

14
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,441
Doing things like this
won't do you any good.

15
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,778
Times have changed.

16
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:02,382
The syndicate cannot survive
just by fighting alone.

17
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:10,490
Only if Spike returned

18
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,293
someone like you would...

19
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,376
I don't feel up for this.

20
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,212
What?

21
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,615
I said, I don't feel like doing this.

22
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,684
Then there's no choice.

23
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,819
Wait, Spike.

24
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,321
I can't burden you.

25
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,356
Don't say stuff like that.

26
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,525
You know who that is, don't you?

27
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,294
- Superficial stuff, yeah.
- Then...

28
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,464
Good money.
Easy to get info on him.

29
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:52,699
We also have a lead.

30
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,701
What makes you scared?

31
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,972
Spike, you're deliberately
avoiding the subject.

32
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:00,807
Are you hiding something from me?

33
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:03,910
So, what happened
to that arm of yours?

34
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,680
- What does that have to do with anything?
- Nothing.

35
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,350
So, you have no intention of telling me?

36
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:11,818
I could ask you the same.

37
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,826
Why is this door so damn narrow?

38
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,833
- Am I interrupting something?
- None of your business.

39
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,902
We're supposed to be comrades.
That's awfully cold of you.

40
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,604
What do you mean, comrades?

41
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,040
Troublemakers should keep
themselves out of this.

42
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,843
Well, I don't care.

43
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:42,715
- So, who is this? What's he up to?
- Don't look without asking us.

44
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,585
What do you mean?
He's just there on the screen.

45
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:46,953
Spike.

46
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,755
Hey, wait, Spike.

47
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,502
- I'm taking off.
<i>- Spike.</i>

48
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:05,405
<i>- Shit, I won't be responsible for you.</i>
- Roger that.

49
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,447
Damn it. He's such a...

50
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,582
"Mao Yenrai.

51
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:19,585
A bounty of 28 million
for the alleged murder

52
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,888
of an executive from
an opposing syndicate."

53
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,424
Amazing. And you guys are after him?

54
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,827
What, did you have a fight?

55
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,729
Shut up. You're being obnoxious.

56
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,599
- You're such a kid.
- I said, you're being obnoxious!

57
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,436
He can do whatever the hell he pleases.

58
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,839
Oh, God.
He's throwing such a huge fit.

59
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,112
<i>You there, Jet?
I got something big for you.</i>

60
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,081
Something big?

61
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:11,104
Excuse me, madam,
but I need to see your ticket.

62
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,873
Oh, I don't have anything like that.

63
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:17,410
Well, then, I am afraid
that you cannot enter the hall.

64
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,747
But they told me I didn't need one.

65
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,916
You know. The guy in the box seat.

66
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,985
Him.

67
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,553
Mao Yenr--

68
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,524
Can you park my vehicle for me?

69
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,797
If it's not one, it's the other.

70
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,999
Why do they all do everything
as they please?

71
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,604
{\an8}There's a protective encryption
on this thing.

72
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,608
You worried?

73
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:51,711
Just watch.
These are decrypted like this

74
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:56,916
{\an8}See? And then, I input "Mao Yenrai."

75
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,889
The bounty part
sure seems to be true, but...

76
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,901
Is this Sir Mao's seat?

77
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,237
I looked all over for it.
Actually, I...

78
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,539
We were waiting for you.

79
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,780
They are performing,
so please stay quiet.

80
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,234
Hold it right there!

81
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,840
I'm not letting you get away.

82
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,279
What are you doing?!

83
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,652
Give it back.
Shit. Give it back, you dumbass!

84
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,557
Really, kids these days.

85
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,026
I'll hand you over to the cops.

86
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:50,663
You.

87
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,807
Hey, isn't it bad for you
to drink it in one shot, Annie?

88
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:06,579
You coming back to life
is worse on me than this glass.

89
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,581
What terrible treatment.

90
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,584
The words of the dead are meaningless.

91
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:12,952
But I'm alive.

92
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,557
No, you died three years ago.
That's how things work here.

93
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,300
I know.

94
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:32,805
The fact that you came here means you
have something you want to know, right?

95
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,107
If it's not much, I can be of help.

96
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:37,910
Anastasia.

97
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:42,348
Stop it. There are only two people
that can call me by that name.

98
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,786
So, what do you want to know?

99
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,354
Mao Yenrai.

100
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:51,591
What happened to him?

101
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,972
Mao-taijin?
There's a reason for this.

102
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,008
No need to talk, Ms. Valentine.

103
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,745
We have done
a background check already.

104
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,216
Rest assured, it will be held
in a safe location.

105
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,218
Please, to your seat.

106
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,408
You're trembling.

107
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,278
Who are you?

108
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:50,316
Vicious.

109
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,706
You know...

110
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,675
I won't say anything bad to you.

111
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,345
Don't get yourself involved
with Vicious anymore.

112
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,181
But I know saying that is useless.

113
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:23,983
Sorry.

114
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,386
You've never listened
to what others say.

115
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,126
On top of it,
you're a stubborn showoff.

116
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:37,930
It can't hurt you to listen to
your elders once in a while.

117
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,300
About Mao...

118
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:46,806
he had a lot of people looking
for you after you were gone.

119
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,942
He said that you still had to be alive.

120
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:55,314
You're finally back, but Mao is...

121
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,084
Stop it already.

122
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,885
This is for Mao.

123
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,323
I'll take that one for Mao.

124
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,815
What are you up to now
to need something like that?

125
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:31,884
Where's the broad?

126
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:35,287
She lost sanity looking at
the bounty figure and took off.

127
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:38,357
Right now she's probably
somewhere, screwing up.

128
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:39,792
I see.

129
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,863
I'll tell you something.
You won't get the bounty for Mao.

130
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,465
He's already dead. He was killed.

131
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,336
Internal discord.
Do you understand?

132
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,238
This is a trap. I'm sure of it.

133
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,940
Yeah. I know all that.

134
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,009
You know?

135
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,212
Then what, you're Mao's?

136
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,214
I owe him one from before.

137
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:08,187
I'll tell you something, Spike.

138
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,892
This arm. It's the price I paid
for being over-spirited

139
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,361
and running ahead of the game.
You understand?

140
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,296
I don't wanna go, either.

141
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,364
Then...

142
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,534
Let's just say,
duties of the life I live.

143
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,975
<i>I've been caught.</i>

144
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,110
You...

145
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,345
<i>Come to the place we specify.</i>

146
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:37,183
<i>Otherwise, my life is over.
So they say,</i>

147
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,351
<i>Lesse... the time to meet is...</i>

148
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,120
It's because you did as you please.

149
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,056
<i>You're being cold.
We're comrades, remember?</i>

150
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:48,027
You reap what you sow.
Take care of it all yourself.

151
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:48,994
<i>Hey, wait.</i>

152
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:51,363
Where is it?

153
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:53,899
<i>You're really gonna come?</i>

154
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,937
Don't worry.
I'm not going there to save you.

155
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,071
Spike.

156
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:26,025
Angels that are forced from heaven
have to become demons.

157
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,428
Isn't that right, Spike?

158
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,200
I'm only watching a dream
that I never awakened from.

159
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,670
I'll wake you up right now.

160
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,204
Don't be so anxious, Vicious.

161
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,974
It's our first meeting in a while, right?

162
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,175
A plea for your life?

163
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:44,576
Hardly.

164
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:48,180
Something like that doesn't
work on you, remember?

165
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,151
After all, you even kill those
who've saved your life.

166
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:57,289
He was a beast who lost his fangs.
That's why he's dead.

167
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,159
The same goes for you.

168
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,168
Now, we want you to drop your gun.

169
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,076
What's wrong? If you don't hurry...

170
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,099
Are you trying to kill me?

171
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,364
Oh, man, what the hell have I done?

172
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:18,237
Yeah?

173
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,506
<i>Thank God. Jet? Spike is--</i>

174
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,473
Not my problem!

175
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:30,582
Goddamn it.

176
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,140
Spike.

177
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,277
Do you know what your face
looks like right now?

178
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,279
What?

179
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:04,383
The same blood runs in you and me.

180
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:08,387
The blood of a beast who wanders,
desiring the blood of others.

181
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,257
I've bled all of that blood away.

182
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:15,094
Then why are you still alive?!

183
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,338
Just like that,

184
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:40,872
sing for me.

185
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,965
Oh, you're finally up. You've slept
too much. It's been three days.

186
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:14,606
What? I was worried about you.
You have to be thankful to me.

187
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,821
Tone-deaf.

188
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:44,703
Oh, well.

189
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:35,113
<i>- What a tough world we live in nowadays.
- What are you talking about?</i>

190
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:38,183
<i>This guy. They're trying to put
a lid on something that stinks.</i>

191
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,584
<i>Can we let things go on?</i>

192
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,686
<i>I'm asking you,
what are you talking about?</i>

193
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:43,555
<i>World affairs, man. World affairs.</i>

194
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,758
<i>With all these lids about,
the world will be buried in lids.</i>

195
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,993
<i>I don't really get it.</i>

196
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:50,128
<i>With stuff like that,
you can't see the truth.</i>

197
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:51,663
<i>Truth, huh?</i>

198
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:54,065
<i>So, lids like that,
I'll crush them all away.</i>

199
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,135
<i>Next Episode: "Sympathy for the Devil."</i>

200
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:58,670
<i>That sounds smelly.</i>
