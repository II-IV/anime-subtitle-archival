1
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,379
The star fell, Bull.

2
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,749
That is no ordinary star.

3
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,119
That is the tear of a warrior.

4
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,254
What is a warrior?

5
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,558
One who has finished his battle
somewhere on this planet...

6
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,465
A pitiful soul that could not
believe in the Great Spirit.

7
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:49,569
The report from Callisto
went directly to Sir Vicious.

8
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,171
He is requesting a deal for Red-Eye.

9
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,775
30,000 Woolongs per gram.
A total of 7500 grams.

10
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,679
Why did he specify you as the dealer?

11
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:04,417
He is a Titan veteran.
We were in the same unit.

12
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:07,320
Why does he rely on you now?

13
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,923
Callisto is undergoing
a depression right now.

14
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,559
If he can't see the future,
he is sure to worry.

15
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:16,396
All the more reason to keep
our hands out of that moon.

16
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:19,966
Vicious, are you not
the one that is worrying?

17
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:24,871
You have no permission
to make your own decisions.

18
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:30,310
Regardless of who it is, those who go
against the Van's will are punished.

19
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,646
You believe that I would
betray my own mentor?

20
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,515
Mao's case was merely bad luck.

21
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:42,422
Lin... You shall go with Vicious.

22
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:43,923
Yes.

23
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:44,857
Wang Long!

24
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:46,993
Callisto is a frigid planet.

25
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,964
Take plenty of winter clothes.

26
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:54,534
To me, no cold climate is
worth taking precautions for.

27
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:58,871
It is true that the planet
is warmer than your heart.

28
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:02,308
Your heart is colder than a snake's skin.

29
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,984
Vicious.

30
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,656
A snake cannot eat a dragon.

31
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,303
I will be fine by myself.

32
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,537
I'll go with you.

33
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:32,772
Remember this.

34
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:37,377
If you want to survive,
you must betray me at times.

35
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:38,544
No, never.

36
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,980
That would go against the Van's will.

37
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,916
Such old-fashioned thinking
makes me nauseous.

38
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,319
Those damn corpses!

39
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,555
I will protect you,
for the honor of the Red Dragon.

40
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,758
Honor, huh?

41
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,627
Then, it's up to me
to slaughter them all!

42
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,049
It's hot.

43
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,356
Where are the others?

44
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,594
What a depressing bunch.

45
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,071
What's with this humidity?

46
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,773
It's so muggy that I can't sleep!

47
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:43,342
Oh, it's just a breakdown.

48
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,882
It'd be hard for me to do
if I saw your faces.

49
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,519
So I'm leaving without seeing you
one last time. Don't look for me.

50
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,721
That wench.

51
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:58,624
She sucked out all the antifreeze
from the radiator.

52
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,493
It'll be out for at least half a day.

53
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,863
Even if she didn't pull this stunt
we wouldn't look for her. Right?

54
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,465
She emptied out the safe.

55
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:15,041
Seven, 8, 9... hello!

56
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,143
Are you really looking for Faye?

57
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,781
1, 0, 1, 1, goodbye!

58
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,051
- Are you just wasting time?
- Is there anything else to do right now?

59
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,419
- Boom!
- You found her?!

60
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,155
I wonder who this is.

61
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,925
Lesse... code name... Julia!

62
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,064
Where is that coming from?!

63
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,065
Lesse...

64
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,400
Pretty close.

65
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:45,104
- Looks like Blue Crow on Callisto.
- Where's it going to?

66
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:47,707
It got disconnected.

67
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,711
- Hey!
- But...

68
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,946
Actually, there are no girls in Blue Crow.

69
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:54,881
Honestly.

70
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:56,749
Hey, Spike

71
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,551
Is that it?

72
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,831
Hey!

73
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:12,965
Hey, wait, Spike!

74
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,202
That's a common woman's name!

75
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,671
What about Faye?

76
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,039
Leave her.

77
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,808
This is a lawless area.

78
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,544
A woman surely can't survive
wandering about all alone!

79
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:25,945
Feeling sympathetic?

80
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,715
Plenty... for the money she ran away with!

81
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,819
Spike!

82
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,192
- I'm gonna go look.
- What?

83
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,494
I'm gonna look for my woman.

84
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,163
You can look for that other woman.

85
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,200
You're gonna have nothing
to do with this?

86
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:53,606
That's right. We only go so far.

87
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,743
Even if you come back,
there won't be a place for you here.

88
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,479
Can't do anything about it.

89
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,749
I'm sure you're not as lonely now
that you have more strange roommates.

90
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,518
Me?

91
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,520
You stayed here just for that reason?

92
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,255
You're being stupid!

93
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,491
It's been three years
since I teamed up with you.

94
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:15,828
But I never knew you looked
at me that way!

95
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:20,266
I was under the impression
that you were the lonely one!

96
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,668
We got rid of that misunderstanding.

97
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,738
Good riddance!
Now we'll have more money for food!

98
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,076
I never did understand you,
even to the very end!

99
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,078
I don't understand, either.

100
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,081
So long!

101
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:59,131
I don't know any woman.

102
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,633
Like I would know!

103
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,034
Not even a rumor?

104
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,370
I have no luck with them!

105
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,039
I'd rather be with an armadillo!

106
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,209
Have you heard of the name Julia?

107
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,144
You should've said so earlier!

108
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,881
There's one in front of Tony's place
every night!

109
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,823
Excuse me! I'm not Julia.

110
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,392
Julius! I'm Julius!

111
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,394
Oh, I see.

112
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,763
Hey, you're my type.

113
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,398
Wanna hang out with me tonight?

114
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,367
I'm sorry, I already have plans.

115
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:38,137
Oh, yeah. Gren might know something.

116
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,007
I've seen him with a woman before.

117
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,308
Gren?

118
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:43,943
It's cold.

119
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,745
Looks like this is it for tonight.

120
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:46,946
Oh, a customer?

121
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,348
Not even. Can't you tell he's straight?

122
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,851
Come on, let's switch locations.

123
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,020
Hey, who and where is Gren?

124
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,056
So you wanna hang out with me tonight?

125
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,661
He's a sax player in Blue Crow.

126
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:16,942
Take care.

127
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:22,748
That was close.

128
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,854
When someone sneezes and isn't told
to take care, that person becomes a fairy.

129
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,723
That's what they say around here.

130
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,092
Then it's okay.

131
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,895
I'm already a fairy.

132
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,105
I'm not as easy as I appear to be.

133
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,841
Unfortunately,
I am not interested in women.

134
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,743
Oh, that's a shame.

135
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:54,013
But the others seem
to be highly interested.

136
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,250
You didn't know that there
were no women in this town?

137
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,155
So, I'll be very popular.

138
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,224
You should watch out.

139
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,863
Thanks for the warning.

140
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,213
I'm searching for something.

141
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,820
There's nothing here.

142
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:39,024
The only things are stale bread,
a broken-down car, and rancid booze.

143
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,328
- I'm looking for a guy named Gren.
- No idea.

144
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,330
I see.

145
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,326
Hey, you need something?

146
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,997
You're Vicious, right?

147
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,231
Me?!

148
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,432
Where's the money?

149
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:23,035
If you don't put out,
it won't do you any good!

150
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:26,872
This is annoying.

151
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,508
So annoying it's repulsive!

152
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,104
What the hell do you mean?!

153
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,275
Why the hell am I Vicious?

154
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:08,581
There was info that there was gonna
be some deal for Red-Eye.

155
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:10,849
From Gren to Vicious.

156
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,418
I thought of taking that cash.

157
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,989
You think I look like I got money?

158
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,458
Foreigners are all rich.

159
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,228
And the code name was Julia?

160
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,498
Sure sounds like some easy wench's name!

161
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,033
Yeah... really.

162
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,343
Give me a Cowboy.

163
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,645
There are no bounties around here.

164
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,047
Bourbon with milk.

165
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:47,453
Oh, that Cowboy. I knew that.
You can't possibly be a bounty-hunter.

166
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,924
<i>So, who's our customer today?</i>

167
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,227
<i>Grencia Mars Elijah Guo Eckener.</i>

168
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:56,629
<i>That's a long name!</i>

169
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:01,000
<i>He escaped from military prison years ago
and the statute of limitations is up.</i>

170
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,167
<i>And that means?</i>

171
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:06,071
<i>The bounty is double!</i>

172
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,173
<i>This is a chance you can't miss!</i>

173
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,011
<i>But I kind of feel
like we can let him go...</i>

174
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,113
<i>Judy, what are you saying?</i>

175
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,681
<i>He's an escaped convict!</i>

176
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,916
<i>But Punch...</i>

177
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,552
<i>He's very handsome!</i>

178
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,588
{\an8}<i>Just look at his picture!</i>

179
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:24,590
{\an8}<i>Lesse... Oh, come on...</i>

180
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,492
<i>I'm much more handsome than he is.</i>

181
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:29,228
<i>Punch, I just can't laugh at that joke.</i>

182
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,563
Hey, can you turn that thing off?!

183
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,299
Well, calm down.

184
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,533
I'm sorry, man.

185
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:39,171
Don't worry. That guy passed out
over there is a cop.

186
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:41,573
What do you wanna say?

187
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,510
Actually, there's a bounty
on my head, too.

188
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,313
This place is a hideout
for people like that.

189
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:50,115
- I see.
- So, you can rest assured.

190
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,518
Me?

191
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:03,996
What's with this?

192
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:07,466
I wanted to get rid of all this
frustration, and nobody's coming?

193
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,436
You're all here.

194
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,040
Miss, your appearance
is rather harmful to the eyes.

195
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,675
Or are you enticing us?

196
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,677
Yeah, I am.

197
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,679
Hold on a minute.

198
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,483
If I don't do this, I'll chip a nail.

199
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,219
Okay, any time now!

200
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:28,620
You wench!

201
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,061
Hurry!

202
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,029
Why did you bring me here?

203
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,364
Because you said you're a fairy.

204
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,167
Why did you come with me?

205
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,236
'Cause I got no place to stay.

206
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,371
You can trust me that easily?

207
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,107
You said you weren't interested in women.

208
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,309
I might take your money and kill you.

209
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,612
That's fine.

210
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,281
I've lived longer than I seem.

211
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,559
It's broken.

212
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,665
You came to such a slummy
neighborhood all by yourself?

213
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,434
I'm alone.

214
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,235
I don't want comrades.

215
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,304
And it's not worth having any.

216
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,674
I end up worrying about things
I don't have to.

217
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,646
You know, 'cause I'm such a good woman.

218
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,750
All the guys end up fighting for me.

219
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:11,223
They often say that humans
can't live alone.

220
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,394
But you can live pretty long
by yourself.

221
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,767
Instead of feeling alone in a group...

222
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:25,537
it's better to be alone in your solitude.

223
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:30,142
When I'm dealing with them,
it's nothing but trouble.

224
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,446
And I don't get squat out of it.

225
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,516
So, it doesn't matter if I'm there or not.

226
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,321
You just got scared of losing them.

227
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,560
So, you distanced yourself from them.

228
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,164
You're weird.

229
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:53,532
Think so?

230
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,702
I don't know why I'm talking
to you about this.

231
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,207
I feel like I'm in a confessional.

232
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,576
Have you ever had
experience as a minister?

233
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:06,311
No.

234
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:21,793
Take care.

235
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,430
- You want to take a shower?
- No, thanks.

236
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,333
I don't know where
peeping toms might be.

237
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,337
You shouldn't peek, either.

238
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,606
I can't guarantee that.

239
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:25,924
<i>Gren... You're not there?</i>

240
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:28,427
Vicious?!

241
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:30,662
<i>I'm out with "honroutou."</i>

242
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,799
<i>With the "mangan" and the "ura-dora,"
it's 32000.</i>

243
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,400
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

244
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,843
Are you dating Julia behind my back?

245
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:47,813
Sir Spike!

246
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,549
Hey, Lin. You've gotten pretty big.

247
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:54,987
He used to work under you,
but things are different now.

248
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:59,658
I feel sorry for her. Having her name
used for some crooked deal like this.

249
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,828
You were always the one
leaving others out of the loop.

250
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:08,000
We still haven't settled
the score from earlier.

251
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:10,936
Any time.

252
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:12,971
Lin!

253
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,686
Get out of the way, Lin!

254
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,590
Julia was here, in this town.

255
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,860
Hey, out of the way, Lin!

256
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:38,930
Lin.

257
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:48,707
A woman?

258
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,343
Which are you?

259
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,885
I am both, but I am neither.

260
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,617
<i>How are men and women different?</i>

261
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:17,088
<i>I think women are hiding
more vital things than men are.</i>

262
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:20,559
<i>Yeah... but there are women
that aren't feminine.</i>

263
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,494
<i>And there are men
that aren't masculine.</i>

264
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,462
<i>What about those that aren't feminine,</i>

265
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,865
<i>but show that side
on some chance circumstance?</i>

266
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,133
<i>I like that.</i>

267
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,169
<i>- I'm not talking about you.
- Then who?</i>

268
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:33,071
<i>Maybe it's Ed!</i>

269
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:36,007
<i>Next episode: Jupiter Jazz, part 2.</i>

270
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:37,008
<i>Maybe it's me.</i>
