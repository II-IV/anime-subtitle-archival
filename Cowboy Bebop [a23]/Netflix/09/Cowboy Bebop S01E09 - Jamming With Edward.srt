1
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:34,794
<i>Here, nobody, here.</i>

2
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,597
<i>Always alone.</i>

3
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,770
<i>38th District is sunny.</i>

4
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,206
<i>Slight rock showers.</i>

5
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:25,411
<i>Chance of rock showers today
is 20 percent.</i>

6
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:29,182
<i>39th District is cloudy.</i>

7
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:32,585
<i>Chance of rock showers
this afternoon is 10 percent.</i>

8
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:52,605
Bebop, here, here! Welcome!

9
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:10,623
<i>Chance of rock showers today
is 90 percent.</i>

10
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,965
<i>Now it's time for today's news topics.</i>

11
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,569
<i>Today we'll discuss
the mysterious land paintings</i>

12
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,438
<i>that suddenly appeared
in what was South America.</i>

13
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,975
{\an8}<i>As usual, we have commentaries by
a researcher of supernatural phenomena...</i>

14
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,244
{\an8}<i>Me, Yuuri Kellerman.</i>

15
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,814
{\an8}<i>Yuuri, about these land paintings...</i>

16
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:41,621
{\an8}<i>Yes, yes. Well, I believe that
it was some sort of a message.</i>

17
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,791
<i>Who would it be from? Can it be...?</i>

18
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:48,428
<i>Aliens. It has to be from aliens.</i>

19
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:54,934
<i>However, the land paintings were drawn
by lasers coming from satellites...</i>

20
00:03:55,535 --> 00:04:00,273
<i>The police think it was a prank pulled
by a hacker who got into the satellite.</i>

21
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:05,278
<i>They already have a bounty
of 8 million woolongs on the culprit...</i>

22
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:09,249
<i>Listen carefully. The bounty of 8 million
is a conspiracy of the government.</i>

23
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,385
<i>Even if it was drawn by a laser,
there is the possibility</i>

24
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:17,890
<i>that aliens put a message
into the brain of that hacker.</i>

25
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,593
{\an8}<i>Once again, the government is
hiding something from us.</i>

26
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,996
{\an8}<i>I see. A secret cult.</i>

27
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:27,834
<i>Yes. And that is the mystery that
I have been searching for all this time.</i>

28
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,472
<i>I'll pass on this one after all.</i>

29
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,741
You're leaving me alone with her?

30
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,044
Nothing wrong with it.
She's gung-ho about it.

31
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,347
I'm not the type
to be led around by women.

32
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:42,815
Then lead her around.

33
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,817
I'm even less the type to do that.

34
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,052
It's easier to...

35
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:50,423
divide 8 million between two than three.

36
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,724
Here we go.

37
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,962
I'm appalled. You're afraid of hackers?

38
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,332
I just hate tedious work like that.

39
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:04,737
Guys cheap enough to hack into things
are depressed pale fatsos with glasses.

40
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:07,774
And I'm sure he's
a demented nerd with smelly feet.

41
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,042
Piece of cake.

42
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:12,712
Do you have something
against someone like that?

43
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,616
I mean, they might've all been
like that when you were young...

44
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:20,053
You're saying I look older than you?

45
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,855
You can't tell a woman's age
just by looking at her.

46
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,525
Exactly.

47
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:29,896
You can't tell just by looking
that I can do things like this...

48
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,664
That's all I know of you.

49
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,899
You guys make a good team.

50
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:34,734
Hurry up.

51
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,870
I'll be waiting for a souvenir from Earth.

52
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,106
There's nothing made on Earth that's good.

53
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,977
{\an8}<i>Well... about this incident...</i>

54
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:49,048
{\an8}<i>Apparently, an old artificial intelligence
satellite has been hacked into.</i>

55
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:52,485
{\an8}<i>The investigation is taking
longer than expected because</i>

56
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:55,421
{\an8}<i>the access code
to that satellite has been long lost.</i>

57
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,724
{\an8}<i>Now a commentary from Mr. Amjad.</i>

58
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:58,658
{\an8}<i>Yes, yes.</i>

59
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:01,494
{\an8}<i>About the relationship between
Earth and the hacker...</i>

60
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:05,531
{\an8}<i>Yes. Since the Gate accident 50 years ago,</i>

61
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,568
{\an8}<i>the people of Earth have
migrated underground as a result</i>

62
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:12,972
{\an8}<i>of the change in climate, namely,
moon rocks falling onto the planet.</i>

63
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,842
{\an8}<i>To them, the "space network"
created by computers is</i>

64
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:20,713
{\an8}<i>necessary for them to stay in contact
with those living in space.</i>

65
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:22,115
{\an8}<i>I see.</i>

66
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:26,586
{\an8}<i>That's becoming a foundation
to create outstanding hackers.</i>

67
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:03,055
Radical Edward!

68
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,124
It's the police! Come out!

69
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:06,893
Yeah!

70
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,028
What? What's wrong?

71
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,062
I saw it.

72
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,442
Why?!

73
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,443
There's nobody in there!

74
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,025
Mistake, mistake.

75
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,170
Okay.

76
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,640
This is where the satellite was
when it was hacked.

77
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,543
This is where it could be accessed from.

78
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,915
I'll look at all the antennae that
can transmit light signals one by one.

79
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:06,152
I'll ask around for info
on any prominent hackers in the area.

80
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:33,679
Bebop's looking
for land picture criminal...

81
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,515
All right!

82
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,852
Satellite of long, long ago...

83
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,822
Where in the world is your access code?

84
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:54,901
Okay. Let's start with all the antennae
that are currently communicating...

85
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,616
That's probably Ed, man.

86
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:13,019
I hear he's a huge guy, two meters tall.

87
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:16,022
Supposedly he used
to be a basketball player.

88
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,825
Yeah, I know Ed.

89
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,327
Radical Edward.

90
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,330
I hear she's a very beautiful,
yet whimsical hacker.

91
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,802
No, no, that hacker is a child.

92
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:33,172
A brat that loves horrible pranks, I hear.

93
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:41,814
Oh, what I heard from the lady next door
is that that hacker is gay.

94
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,651
Hacker? You mean Ed?

95
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,153
He's an alien.

96
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,088
That's what everyone says.

97
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:54,961
Hey, man.

98
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,131
Can you buy some of this
as the price for the info?

99
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,366
What is that?

100
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,134
You don't know?

101
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,904
It's "Piyoko,"
a well-known specialty of Earth.

102
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,877
The stolen satellites...

103
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,814
Where are you?

104
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,990
What? What's this?

105
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,959
The information isn't connected to Earth.

106
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,762
It's connected only between satellites.

107
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,331
And nobody hacked into it.

108
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,801
<i>Here, nobody, here.</i>

109
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,371
<i>Always alone.</i>

110
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:44,410
A voice... inside... head...

111
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:56,789
Who are you?

112
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,093
What? What did you just say?

113
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:06,899
<i>Who, you? Here, always.</i>

114
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:10,670
Edward. A 'net diver from Earth.

115
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,004
<i>Earth?</i>

116
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,740
Yup. Hey, what's your name?

117
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:22,014
<i>I am the satellite control program
on the D-135 artificial satellite.</i>

118
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,184
What's that? Don't you have a nickname?

119
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,720
Then Ed will give you one.

120
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,090
I know!

121
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,026
Because you're a computer,
you can be MPU.

122
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,696
MPU! Cool name!

123
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:43,135
Ed is Edward Wong Hau
Pepelu Tivrusky the Fourth.

124
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:44,737
Ed for short.

125
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,739
Nice to meet you.

126
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,075
Here. A souvenir from Earth.

127
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,478
Is this food?

128
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,047
It makes me doubt
that they have any sense.

129
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:59,785
Unlike you, I learned some information.

130
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:04,323
They said that an unknown hacker named
Radical Edward is the suspicious one.

131
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,759
It doesn't mean anything if he's unknown.

132
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:08,994
I know, more or less.

133
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,332
- It seems okay.
- What kind of thing is it?

134
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:19,105
Two meters tall. Ex-basketball player.
Beautiful kid.

135
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,241
And on top of it, a gay alien.

136
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,447
Why did you doodle on Earth?

137
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:33,919
<i>Long, long ago,
long before the Gate accident...</i>

138
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:39,125
<i>Earth was a beautiful planet
where many people lived.</i>

139
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:43,496
<i>And back then on Earth,
there were many pictures like this,</i>

140
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:46,265
<i>and I always looked at them.</i>

141
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,235
<i>I remembered those times,</i>

142
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:53,005
<i>and I tried
to recreate at least the pictures.</i>

143
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:58,244
I see, doodles like this were
on Earth long ago, too.

144
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,881
<i>Yes. I recreated them
with a 2-percent margin of error.</i>

145
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:06,352
MPU is good at drawing.
Can Ed draw something, too?

146
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,954
What? What's wrong?

147
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:10,923
<i>This is...</i>

148
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,292
<i>The police are putting out
a jamming signal.</i>

149
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:17,363
Hey! MPU! Hey!

150
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:22,301
Looks like the cops touched base
with Radical Edward, as well.

151
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,409
<i>Listen! I found your bounty.</i>

152
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:31,477
What the...?

153
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:33,445
<i>Bebop!</i>

154
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:38,517
<i>The real culprit
in the satellite-jacking wasn't a hacker.</i>

155
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,453
Since when do we have
an interactive channel?

156
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:42,821
No, that's not it.

157
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,957
This is a real-time hack job.

158
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,525
Who is this kid?

159
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,061
<i>I'll send you MPU's data now.</i>

160
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,263
Wait a minute, what is MPU?

161
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:52,932
<i>A friend of Ed's.</i>

162
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,134
Hey, do you know Ed?

163
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,870
<i>Yeah, because Ed is Ed.</i>

164
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:02,174
I don't care about that. Who did it?

165
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,911
<i>I could tell you.</i>

166
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,180
<i>But I have a favor to ask in return.</i>

167
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,548
A favor?

168
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:12,851
Yeah, yeah.
Your big sister will listen to you later.

169
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:13,919
Come on, hurry it up.

170
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:21,293
I see. The AI from the abandoned satellite
is doodling of its own will.

171
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,329
What? What's up?

172
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,999
And on top of that,
it was supposedly listed as

173
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,468
a weather satellite,
so nobody suspected anything.

174
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,271
Then this satellite is our bounty?

175
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,242
<i>Since the access code
to MPU can't be used anymore,</i>

176
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,544
<i>you need to go directly to the satellite.</i>

177
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,379
And what do we do?

178
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:44,083
<i>Break the antennae that it uses
to communicate with the other satellites.</i>

179
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:49,088
<i>Then make a direct connection
to the satellite and download MPU.</i>

180
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:53,359
<i>And when you do, don't use
computer support for firing or flying.</i>

181
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:56,095
What? All manual?

182
00:14:56,295 --> 00:15:00,499
<i>Yup. If it notices you,
all the attack satellites connected to MPU</i>

183
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,601
<i>will automatically fire back.</i>

184
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,403
<i>Is this hard?</i>

185
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:08,674
It's not just hard,
it's downright impossible.

186
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,277
It's like playing baseball with no bat.

187
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,245
Hey, Spike.

188
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,482
That's the kind of stuff I like.

189
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:27,092
Hey. Wait, you.
How do you know about us?

190
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,427
<i>I know everything.</i>

191
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:33,265
Last week, you let Ajiz, a bounty on Mars
worth 1.5 million, get away.

192
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:37,670
And in Pyortle before that,
the police got to them first.

193
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:41,674
Are you really that hacker,
Radical Edward?!

194
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,243
Yeah. You've heard?

195
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,149
<i>Connect D-7 to 2. That way,</i>

196
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,118
<i>the main cannon will fire
without a computer.</i>

197
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,253
I'm trusting you, man.

198
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:58,590
<i>Now listen. Avoid using the missile
if you can help it. It's expensive.</i>

199
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,658
Roger.

200
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:02,094
<i>1200 to target.</i>

201
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,730
It's almost time
to cut off computer controls.

202
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,699
Now, the only chance...

203
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,300
Once is enough.

204
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:18,077
{\an8}<i>Anyway, you can prove
that the satellite itself,</i>

205
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,212
{\an8}<i>and not a hacker, is the bounty, right?</i>

206
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,081
Ed can do that.

207
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,050
Anyway, please, listen to my favor.

208
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,319
Then I'll give you all the bounty, too.

209
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,522
Oh, you're a surprisingly good kid.

210
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,164
That's it?

211
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:55,547
<i>Someone...</i>

212
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,061
How was it?

213
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,029
Did you get it?

214
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:14,400
No, I missed. The satellite
in front of it shielded the blast.

215
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,609
Then you have
to shoot down all the satellites.

216
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,810
All of them?

217
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,212
If you don't, they'll shoot us down.

218
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,652
ECM, eh?

219
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,221
Cheap ones are no good after all.

220
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,634
This is getting pointless.

221
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,404
<i>Approach to within 20 meters of MPU.</i>

222
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,374
<i>That way,
the other satellites can't attack.</i>

223
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:56,608
However...

224
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,811
<i>Until then, Faye will act as a decoy.</i>

225
00:17:59,078 --> 00:17:59,778
Me?

226
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:00,712
Yeah, thanks.

227
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,346
Come on, hurry up.

228
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,516
All right, it's all yours.

229
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,385
MPU!

230
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,624
MPU? MPU?!

231
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,459
<i>Oh, Ed.</i>

232
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,195
<i>Ed, we meet again.</i>

233
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,731
They have a bounty on you, MPU.

234
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:53,866
<i>Bounty?</i>

235
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:57,636
Yup, but if we copy you
and let them catch that,

236
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,171
you'll be all right.

237
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,405
<i>All right?</i>

238
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,342
And you must be lonely there alone, MPU.

239
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,345
If you come over here,
there are lots of friends.

240
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,679
<i>Friends?</i>

241
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:09,882
Here. It's not scary.

242
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:23,362
{\an8}<i>And so, the strange end to this case.</i>

243
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,264
{\an8}<i>The captured criminal...</i>

244
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:30,903
<i>was the AI program for a spy satellite
launched before the Earth was ruined.</i>

245
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,641
<i>According to government sources
from back then, it supposedly would</i>

246
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:39,178
<i>continue activity on its own
even without commands from Earth.</i>

247
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:45,350
Well, it was the perfect excuse
for the cops to go on a hacker hunt.

248
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:52,257
But anyway, why did it start doodling
on the Earth with a laser all of a sudden?

249
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:53,458
I'm sure...

250
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,195
that was because it got lonely.

251
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,499
Yoo-hoo, Bebop!

252
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,635
Hey, over here! Hurry!

253
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,571
<i>Promise, promise.</i>

254
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,839
Well, let's get going now.

255
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:10,642
But the kid is saying
something about a promise.

256
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:13,345
Promises are made to be broken.

257
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,781
Anyway, let's get going. Liftoff!

258
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,425
Not coming, not coming.

259
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,413
What is this?! What's going on?!

260
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,816
What did you promise?

261
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:59,891
It's a promise...
to be a member of the Bebop.

262
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,835
<i>Amigos, all you bounty hunters.</i>

263
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,471
<i>It's finally time for</i> Big Shot<i>!</i>

264
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,640
<i>Now today's hot news.</i>

265
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,776
<i>You heard about the doodling satellite
that got caught?</i>

266
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,879
<i>Of course. It had a big bounty on it.</i>

267
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:24,016
<i>Just a few moments ago,
the Earth police made an official report.</i>

268
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,317
<i>What was it?</i>

269
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:30,789
<i>"This bounty is only for when humans
or other life forms are the targets.</i>

270
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:36,361
<i>It is difficult to determine whether
or not a computer program is a life form.</i>

271
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:39,364
<i>To begin with, from the viewpoint
of biological logistics..."</i>

272
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,667
<i>What's that? I don't understand well.</i>

273
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:45,470
<i>In other words,
they can't pay up on non-living things.</i>

274
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,672
<i>Oh, my!</i>

275
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,874
<i>To those who caught it,
I feel sorry for you.</i>

276
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:57,049
Hey, Jet, did you know
that there are three things that I hate?

277
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:58,617
Whatever.

278
00:21:58,617 --> 00:21:59,618
Rugrats...

279
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:00,819
beasts...

280
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,788
and tomboys.

281
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,626
Don't give me that.

282
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:10,629
Why do we have all three
neatly gathered here?

283
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,798
Ed loves Piyokos.

284
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,400
And once again we didn't get any bounty.

285
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,869
Hey, wait, you're a girl?

286
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:22,407
Really, nothing good comes out of Earth.

287
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:07,179
<i>No regrets about the woman who ran away,</i>

288
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:10,515
<i>but a small thorn still pricks the heart.</i>

289
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,518
<i>Letting one flow along with time itself,</i>

290
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:15,954
<i>living all alone from that day to this.</i>

291
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:18,757
<i>But to the sounds of waves
that come and go,</i>

292
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:21,193
<i>the migrating birds
find their hearts drawn.</i>

293
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,462
<i>Next episode: "Ganymede Elegy."</i>

294
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:29,701
<i>Jet Black will sing it up full of soul.</i>
