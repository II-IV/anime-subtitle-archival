1
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:33,793
I'm gonna go look.

2
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:34,794
What?

3
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,330
I'm gonna look for my woman.

4
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,599
You can look for that other woman.

5
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,439
Are you dating Julia behind my back?

6
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,444
I feel like I'm in a confessional...

7
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,847
Have you had any
experience as a minister?

8
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:56,850
You were always the one
leaving others out of the loop.

9
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,354
We still haven't settled
the score from earlier.

10
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,524
Any time.

11
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,192
Lin!

12
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,764
Hey, out of the way, Lin!

13
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,135
Lin...

14
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,666
<i>I was in the same unit
as Vicious on Titan.</i>

15
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,869
You said that you didn't need comrades...

16
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,640
but I'm attracted to that word.

17
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,409
To the point of tears.

18
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,647
On Titan, we were all comrades.

19
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,433
What song is that?

20
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,905
Julia.

21
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:00,807
That's a good tune.

22
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,614
Would you mind if I played that on
my sax when I go home after all this?

23
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:54,394
<i>After I came home from the war,
I was imprisoned.</i>

24
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,996
They suspected that I was a spy.

25
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,966
I heard that Vicious
testified against me.

26
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,538
In prison, I went insane from insomnia.

27
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,974
As a result, I became a drug addict.

28
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,676
There were side effects.

29
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:13,012
My hormonal balance went out of whack,
and this is what happened.

30
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:18,818
You're the second person to know
Vicious since I arrived here.

31
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,654
And the second I've talked
about this to.

32
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,490
Why are you going to see Vicious?

33
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,427
Didn't you just say that he framed you?

34
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,396
I want to see if he really did.

35
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:31,698
You're going to die.

36
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,599
I'm not afraid to die.

37
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:34,701
You're lying.

38
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,471
Either way, I won't last much longer.

39
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,642
Why did you bring me here?

40
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,448
Perhaps I wanted to be with someone.

41
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,418
You selfishly help people,
and bring them along...

42
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,520
and then you go off to die?

43
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,836
Are you sure it was this woman?

44
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:13,973
Yeah. It's been six months since
I last saw a woman in the flesh,

45
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,076
and two years since I saw
someone that good looking.

46
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,112
Of course I wouldn't make a mistake.

47
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:22,515
I never wanna live in this town.

48
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,585
She sat there, and was talking to Gren.

49
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,988
Julia always sat in that seat, too.

50
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:30,590
Julia?

51
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:35,828
She suddenly wandered in two years ago,
and disappeared before a month passed.

52
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,463
What kind of woman was she?

53
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,767
She was a real babe.

54
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,174
<i>I'm the only one
that can keep you alive.</i>

55
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,011
<i>And I'm the only one
that can kill you.</i>

56
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:55,915
<i>I'm only watching a dream
that I never awakened from.</i>

57
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,818
<i>It's like I am watching a dream...</i>

58
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,621
<i>Be careful when you're with that woman.</i>

59
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,991
<i>Women are all liars.</i>

60
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,996
<i>When this is over,
I'm getting out of all this.</i>

61
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,132
<i>And then, will you come with me?</i>

62
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,005
<i>Are you going to betray me?</i>

63
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,708
<i>They're going to kill you.</i>

64
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,144
<i>Oh, you're finally up.</i>

65
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,447
<i>You've slept too much.
It's been three days.</i>

66
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,652
<i>Your left eye and right eye
are different colors.</i>

67
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,588
<i>My left eye sees the past...</i>

68
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,624
<i>Then what about your right eye?</i>

69
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,209
I'm not dead.

70
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:12,925
Which way is west?

71
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:17,763
Thanks.

72
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,138
Tranquilizer, huh?
They're mocking me.

73
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,569
Sorry, but can I ask you something?

74
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:59,205
Where is a blue apartment
building called Orlando?

75
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,941
Don't ask me! I don't know anything!

76
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:03,776
Come on.

77
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,680
I want nothing to do
with foreigners from now on.

78
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,148
I'm just asking!

79
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,618
I'm gonna go find an honest job.

80
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,892
What the hell?

81
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:28,768
It's here.

82
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:57,863
Hey!

83
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,332
Hey, get it together!

84
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,270
Jet?

85
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:06,305
What the hell are you doing?

86
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:09,942
What's all this about?

87
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,612
He was one of those kinds of guys?

88
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,680
What are you saying?

89
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,783
Gren isn't like that.

90
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,785
Gren?

91
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,993
"Mangan" with "ura-dora."

92
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,029
He's using an ancient code.

93
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,036
Julia was here... in this town.

94
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,675
<i>Yo.</i>

95
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,010
Yeah?

96
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,411
<i>Got anything?</i>

97
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:46,412
None.

98
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,014
<i>I got something good.</i>

99
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,382
Catch them yourself.

100
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,351
I know about the guy
from that code name "Julia."

101
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,353
<i>It's a guy named Gren.</i>

102
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,222
<i>He's an escaped convict</i>

103
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,791
and has a hefty bounty on his head.

104
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,126
If you catch him,

105
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,761
<i>I'll let you back on.</i>

106
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:14,673
Hello?

107
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,375
<i>I'm overhead.</i>

108
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,146
<i>Come to the roof of the building
closest to the sky.</i>

109
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,448
I'll send a woman over.

110
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,183
<i>I don't care.</i>

111
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,386
<i>Although I would have
liked to see you as well.</i>

112
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,392
You broke the Bebop,

113
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:37,696
but kept the Swordfish
and Hammerhead mobile.

114
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,800
Did you leave that message
so that we'd come find you?

115
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,135
You've got to be kidding.

116
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,404
Were you just testing us?

117
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:47,940
Why did you come here?

118
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:49,875
I want my money back.

119
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,377
The safe...

120
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,480
only had 20,000 in it.

121
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,248
Is that so?

122
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:57,783
Dummy.

123
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,754
Hey. Who is Julia?

124
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:06,192
I don't know. But she has
something to do with Spike.

125
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,160
That's all I know.

126
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,455
Souvenir, souvenir, is it here yet?

127
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,269
It has an EX+ ranking. It's real.

128
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:24,436
Hand it over.

129
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,441
This is the Titan Opal
that you requested.

130
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,112
Give Gren my regards.

131
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,416
You saved me from that scorpion back then.

132
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,386
Yet you sold me out.

133
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,607
Gren?

134
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,176
Long time no see.

135
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,078
What are you up to?

136
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:09,181
You gave me that music box
because you...

137
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,351
never thought I'd take
it apart and examine it?

138
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,087
You found the transmitter.

139
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,122
Julia was the one who found it.

140
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,460
She realized as soon as she heard
it was a gift from you.

141
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,562
And what about it?

142
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,066
Are you trying to kill me again?

143
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,536
We fought in the war together.

144
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,038
We were comrades.

145
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:40,412
We fought together
on that desert battlefield.

146
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,183
I looked up to you.

147
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,988
I believed in you.

148
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,194
There is nothing there to believe.

149
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,430
Nor is there a need to believe.

150
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,468
Sir Vicious!

151
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,156
In this world,
there is nothing to believe in.

152
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,532
Vicious!

153
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:40,339
Lin's soul won't be saved since he lost
his life protecting someone like you!

154
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,975
I'm not what he was protecting!

155
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,543
He protected the rules!

156
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,565
You're in the way!

157
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,198
Hey! Come on, get a grip! Hey!

158
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,201
Where is Julia?
Where did she go?

159
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:53,772
Do you know her?

160
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,708
Where is she now?

161
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:04,817
He hit some vital organs.

162
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:09,188
Shit, would an ambulance
come to a place like this?

163
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,429
Can you lift me up into the pod again?

164
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,833
I want to go to Titan.

165
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,368
You can't possibly last
in your condition!

166
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:24,870
It would take too long!

167
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,440
I won't last long anyway.

168
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,443
Dying during the voyage
would be a good way to go.

169
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:36,515
I want to return there...
one more time.

170
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,885
I want to be as close as I can.

171
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:41,787
Please.

172
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,435
I see.

173
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,371
You are Spike.

174
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,808
Julia was always talking about you.

175
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,678
That your two eyes were
of different colors.

176
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:08,714
That's what she said.

177
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:13,752
That you get a strange feeling
when you look into his eyes.

178
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,321
What was she doing?

179
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:20,926
In the corner seat of the bar.

180
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,264
She always sat there
while I wasn't paying attention.

181
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,233
She always requested...

182
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,269
the same song...

183
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,337
...and smiled.

184
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,774
Sadly...

185
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:37,943
smiled.

186
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:48,447
What do you have?

187
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:49,715
<i>Nothing.</i>

188
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,852
<i>Hurry up and get in. We're taking off.</i>

189
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,631
Julia.

190
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,332
What?

191
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:10,802
Nothing. Just an adult's idle muttering.

192
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,338
Where did all of you guys go?

193
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,840
Someplace good.

194
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,009
Ed's the only one left out!

195
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:19,478
I'll tell you someday.

196
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:22,614
Nah, it's okay, really.

197
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,617
You're not being cute.

198
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,969
The star fell, Bull.

199
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,306
That is no ordinary star.

200
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,408
That is the tear of a warrior.

201
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,476
What is a warrior?

202
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:55,714
One who has finished his battle
somewhere on this planet.

203
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:03,322
A pitiful soul that could
not believe in the Great Spirit.

204
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,186
<i>What is going on with this world?</i>

205
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:16,588
<i>In life, darkness looms
one inch away from you.</i>

206
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:19,224
<i>This world is truly full of mistakes.</i>

207
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:24,729
<i>In that case, we'll step
away from the mainstream...</i>

208
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:27,165
<i>and lead the life of a dropout.</i>

209
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:29,868
<i>A psychedelic rhapsody
for someone just like you.</i>

210
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:33,505
<i>Next episode: "Bohemian Rhapsody."</i>

211
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:38,510
<i>Now, won't you waste
away your life with us?</i>
