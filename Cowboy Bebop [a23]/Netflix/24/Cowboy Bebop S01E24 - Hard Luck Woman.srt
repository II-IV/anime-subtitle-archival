1
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,396
Since when were you...?

2
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,799
Water sploosh.

3
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,435
You know this?

4
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,738
I think I know, I don't think I know.

5
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,641
I don't think I know that I know.

6
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,811
I think I know
even though I don't think I know.

7
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,214
Which is it?!

8
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,551
Hey!

9
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,183
Hey, Spike, where the hell are we?!

10
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,586
- Isn't it Earth?
- Earth?

11
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,322
Hey, this ship was headed for Mars!

12
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,758
Why the hell are we on Earth
all of a sudden?!

13
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,761
- I don't know.
- Shit, this isn't funny.

14
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,196
While we're wasting time, our fugitive...

15
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,465
It was the first big one in a while.

16
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,302
- In any case, why the hell are we on--?
- Jet.

17
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:24,671
The women are gone.

18
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,980
<i>Listen, if you lead me
to that "water sploosh" place,</i>

19
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,515
<i>I'll give you something good.</i>

20
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:36,950
<i>Good thing? What?</i>

21
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,286
Something very tremendously
wonderfully good.

22
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:46,392
Something very tremendously
wonderfully good!

23
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:24,330
Hot!

24
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,433
Hot! Hot! Hot!

25
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,614
This!

26
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,618
Water sploosh!

27
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,792
I knew I shouldn't have trusted you.

28
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,400
Hey, I found Ed!

29
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,403
Ed has been found?

30
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,004
What? You know them?

31
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,874
...35 point 38 point 0, 35 point 48
point 1, 35 point 48 point 2...

32
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,410
This! This! This!

33
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,012
- Hey, can I have your nails?
- Nails?

34
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,948
I'm collecting them! Can I, please?
Just the pinky will do!

35
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,817
...35 point 52 point 3, 35 point...

36
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,385
This! This!

37
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,788
- Come on, can I have it? Please?
- What are you guys?!

38
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:22,822
Hey!

39
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,833
Ed?!

40
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,638
Is that really you... Ed?

41
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,385
I'm sorry about that.

42
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:56,355
That's the best way
to make the kids listen.

43
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:57,924
It's all right.

44
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,395
Is Ed from this place?

45
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,965
She wandered in about five years ago.

46
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,136
Before I knew it, she was eating with us
as if it had always been that way.

47
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:14,040
And about three years ago,
she wandered away...

48
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,776
as if she was a cat or something.

49
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,847
I was wondering
how she was doing nowadays.

50
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,716
But I didn't think
she would suddenly appear.

51
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,719
All right, it's time to eat!

52
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,662
Dear Lord, up in the heaven.

53
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:38,865
Never mind the rest. Let's eat!

54
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,067
Let's eat!

55
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,176
I have to get going now.

56
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,578
What, you can stay longer, right?

57
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,782
- I'm actually looking for something.
- Ed knows where it is.

58
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:59,819
We just came here for food.

59
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,421
You...

60
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:05,424
You have to give me something good!

61
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,026
Oh, yeah, Ed.

62
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:11,097
There's something good
in the desk drawer over there.

63
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,533
- Something good?
- Go get it.

64
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,735
Something good!

65
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,570
Inside that drawer.

66
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,109
Not that.

67
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,913
Yeah, that. Open it!

68
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:34,687
Her father.

69
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:36,055
Whose?

70
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:40,493
He came looking for Ed
about two months ago.

71
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,596
He said he forgot
that he had put her in an orphanage,

72
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:48,467
and that he had been looking for 7 years,
hopping around the world.

73
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,838
I hope she will be able to meet him.

74
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:55,208
People have to cherish
what ties they have.

75
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:10,223
Yeah!

76
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,141
Are you Faye?

77
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:32,712
Impossible.

78
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:34,780
Really?

79
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,116
It's me, Sally Yung!

80
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,886
I was in your high school
graduating class!

81
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,226
Are you all right?

82
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,265
I was really surprised.

83
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:56,536
I thought you were a ghost.
You look just like you did back then.

84
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,072
You know, they say ghosts appear
in places where they have regrets.

85
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,909
Oh, yeah, I remember now.

86
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:06,112
You were put in cold sleep
after that accident.

87
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,915
- That's why you still look the same.
- Accident?

88
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,318
Faye... you don't remember?

89
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:15,254
I...

90
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:18,558
Grandma!

91
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,031
Grandma, we gotta go back now.

92
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:26,699
Is it that time already?

93
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,806
Do you know who this is?

94
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:36,809
I bet you don't know.

95
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,912
- Actually, she's--
- A ghost.

96
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,617
Goodbye. Take care.

97
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,888
Hey, you guys! What's with
the course change without asking?!

98
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,058
Our plans have all been screwed
because of it!

99
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,794
I don't appreciate
you doing things on your own!

100
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,380
You want to smell something really good?

101
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,132
What's with them?

102
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,834
What are they being so secretive about?

103
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,902
Leave them alone.

104
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:12,371
Maybe they're too hungry
for their own good.

105
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:16,675
Humans go insane if they don't eat food.

106
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,144
Fifty million?

107
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,414
I see. Pretty big.

108
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:25,251
"Appledelhi Siniz Hesap Lutfen."

109
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,762
Would you like one, Mackenroe?

110
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,197
That's McIntire.

111
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,800
No, thank you, Mr. Appledelhi.

112
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,169
You sure? Eggs are good.

113
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:48,174
As they say, power and charge.
That's what's important, Macintosh.

114
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,875
That's McIntire.

115
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:53,479
Why is it that you can't ever remember
your assistant's name?

116
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,149
Don't worry
about the small things in life.

117
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,257
- Hurry, Macky-Mike!
- That's McIntire!

118
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,313
Watch where you're going!

119
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,152
Hey.

120
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:41,520
Sorry.

121
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:43,489
Sorry?

122
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:46,926
I...

123
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,033
I have to go.

124
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,481
Going out? Where are you going?

125
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,054
I finally remembered where I belong.

126
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:16,422
Where you belong?

127
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:21,427
You have someone waiting for you, too.
You have somewhere you belong.

128
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,429
You should go look for it, too.

129
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:29,335
That's the best thing, you know.

130
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,281
This one is a piece of cake.

131
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,516
Fifty million is right there!

132
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,988
If they can eat sukiyaki filled with meat,
then they--

133
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,222
Faye went out.

134
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,259
Again?
Where the hell did she go this time?

135
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,332
"A woman's heart
and the skies of Ganymede," was it?

136
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,307
You're Appledelhi?

137
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,510
Can you come along with us?

138
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,446
Cooperate with us
if you don't wanna get hurt.

139
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,950
Who are you guys?
Don't interrupt our work!

140
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,018
Work?

141
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:23,455
What does this Earth need
to regain a peaceful peace?

142
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:26,392
This Earth of wild chaos!
Is it the cosmos?

143
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,029
That is a map! A map!

144
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,165
Yes, happiness comes
in the form of a map!

145
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:37,369
We are creating maps to save the Earth!

146
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,705
A map?

147
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:43,542
But meteors fall often
and change the landscape.

148
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:49,181
That's why we're globetrotting.
We're chasing after every meteor.

149
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:52,117
Until every single meteor falls to Earth!

150
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:56,622
Enough with the excuses!

151
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,226
You!

152
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,365
I wasn't expecting someone this adept.

153
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,425
- Is that you, Ed?!
- That's enough! Stop!

154
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,006
Françoise!

155
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,314
How's that? And that, and that?

156
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,457
This is father-person.

157
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,693
Father?

158
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,661
Your father?

159
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,432
She had such a thing?

160
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,602
This is Spike-person and Jet-person.

161
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:17,636
I see.

162
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,176
No, father. Good people.

163
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,611
Oh? I see.

164
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,180
Thank you for taking care of my son.

165
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,649
Or was it daughter?

166
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,185
Oh ,well. It's all right either way.

167
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,754
That's a token of my appreciation.

168
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:40,225
Then, Ed, were you the one
who put the bounty on...?

169
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:46,198
Fifty point zero, zero, zero,
zero, zero, zero?

170
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,268
Only 50 woolongs?

171
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:52,237
So, you wanna come with me?

172
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,783
Hurry, Michael-duck!

173
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,452
That's McIntire!

174
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:07,653
Hey, wait!

175
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:10,656
Father!

176
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,568
He's gone.

177
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,361
Hey, it's dinnertime.

178
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:40,772
Spike, dinner.

179
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,387
You can't come with me, Ein.

180
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,958
Ed is going someplace far, far away.

181
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,861
I might not be coming back.

182
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,399
So, Ein, you should go back home.

183
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,438
Do you want to come with Ed?

184
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,096
Let's go, Ein!

185
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:47,365
<i>Too much time has passed by</i>

186
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:52,370
<i>To lament that we were deeply in love</i>

187
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:58,810
<i>The wind keeps blowing, while my heart</i>

188
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:04,416
<i>Cannot heal all the tears in it</i>

189
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:12,991
<i>Someone cry for me with parched eyes.</i>

190
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:20,098
<i>The real folk blues</i>

191
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:23,034
<i>I only want to know</i>

192
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:28,840
<i>What true sadness is</i>

193
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,810
<i>Sitting in muddy water</i>

194
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:35,147
<i>Isn't such a bad life</i>

195
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:43,455
<i>If it ends</i>

196
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:49,494
<i>After the first time</i>

197
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:09,748
<i>Everything has a beginning and an end.</i>

198
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,817
<i>Life is just a cycle of them.</i>

199
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:17,088
<i>With unwanted endings, becoming an adult</i>

200
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:20,458
<i>is to experience the inevitable finale.</i>

201
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,862
<i>It's been a fast trip for Bebop,
with only two episodes left.</i>

202
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,165
<i>But make sure you pay close attention
to how it ends.</i>

203
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:30,669
<i>Next episode:
"The Real Folk Blues Part 1."</i>
