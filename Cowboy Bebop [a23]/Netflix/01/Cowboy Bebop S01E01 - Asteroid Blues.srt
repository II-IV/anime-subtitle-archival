00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:14,734
Cowboy Bebop Season 1

2
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:21,574
ASTEROID BLUES

3
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,354
Hey, Spike.

4
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,393
- It's ready.
- I'm just about done myself.

5
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,360
What's cooking?

6
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,663
Special beef with bell peppers.

7
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:29,275
Asimov Solensan. This is our next target.

8
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:31,678
Hey, Jet...

9
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:35,515
He's high up in the syndicate
that deals all around the asteroids.

10
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,550
About this beef with bell peppers...

11
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,787
The guy's name is Asimov Solensan.
Weren't you listening to me?

12
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:43,556
You don't call
a meatless beef with bell peppers

13
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,793
"beef with bell peppers," do you?

14
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,495
Yes, you do.

15
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,733
- No, you don't.
- You do when you're broke.

16
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,803
What happened to the million-woolong
bounty from that last guy?

17
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,539
The repair bill
for the plane you wrecked...

18
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,575
and the shop you trashed...

19
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,244
and the medical bill
of the cop you injured

20
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:06,012
killed the dough!

21
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:13,686
Three days ago, there was a shootout
between his group and an enemy syndicate.

22
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,956
He killed his own men and took off.

23
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,860
They say he's hiding
with his woman in Tijuana.

24
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,596
That's a place for nobodies to go.

25
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,733
Despite being a nobody,
he's worth 2.5 million.

26
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,501
Don't feel like it.

27
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:32,705
Tijuana... The beef there is really tasty.

28
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:57,397
<i>Attention, please.
We will soon arrive at the gate.</i>

29
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:02,335
<i>We look forward to serving you again.</i>

30
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:18,851
I'll head over
after hitting up the cops for clues.

31
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,954
Then I'll try seeing old man Bull.

32
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,924
<i>Can you trust that old guy?</i>

33
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,855
Such an easygoing song.

34
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,545
Thief!

35
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,891
This again? Goddamn son of a bitch.

36
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,862
Man, you're totally ripping me off,

37
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,431
but do you realize
the reason you can live here

38
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:42,401
is because I dug that gate
with all my might?

39
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:45,404
This again.
You always say that when you lose.

40
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:48,741
We all dug the gate together, remember?

41
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,545
That we did.
We dug like there was no tomorrow.

42
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,580
Goddamn idiot son of a bitch!

43
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:10,663
Give me a beer.

44
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:13,533
And I'll have a bloody mary.

45
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,906
I got vodka, but unfortunately,
I'm out of tomato juice.

46
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,109
I'm sure there's one can in the back room.

47
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:26,546
I'll take a look.

48
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:41,194
Top-notch Red-Eye.
You'd know, as a buyer, right?

49
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,996
Can it be... Bloody-Eye?

50
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,708
Prove to me that it's the real thing.

51
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,702
Keep those eyes open.

52
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:31,103
This is dandy,
but you got anything to eat?

53
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:36,943
I see.

54
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:44,717
The red-eyed coyote will appear
at the north end of town.

55
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,018
That is what I see.

56
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,754
A red-eyed coyote, huh?

57
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,156
You, Swimming Bird...

58
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,759
You shall meet a woman.

59
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,128
You shall be targeted by that woman.

60
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,031
And then death.

61
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,702
- Again. I see.
- Again?

62
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,870
I've already died once.

63
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:06,872
Got killed by a woman.

64
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,942
You take women too lightly.

65
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:11,611
Catch you later.

66
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,882
May he be blessed by Wakantanka.

67
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,363
Presidente?

68
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,798
I'll have a glass on the house.

69
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,074
Damn. Asimov sure lost his head.

70
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:45,978
No shit. We gotta do something
before the cops start moving.

71
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,247
You wanna leave it up to the cops?

72
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,249
He is using those eye drops.

73
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,084
There's no way we can win.

74
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:56,422
I'm telling you, we got nothing
if we don't get that Bloody-Eye back.

75
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:57,690
But, man...

76
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,358
Hey.

77
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,964
Can you give me the specifics?

78
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,408
Man, I'm hungry.

79
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:19,979
You, too?

80
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,922
It's better to leave the water running.

81
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:07,860
Or it'll clog.

82
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:30,483
Oh, I'm sorry.

83
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,222
Thank you.

84
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,331
I'm sorry.

85
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,135
I don't want that anymore.
You can have it.

86
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:01,480
I'm really sorry, honest.
Felt like my stomach was glued to my back.

87
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,488
Nice fighter.

88
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:12,558
It's an old model.
She's been with me for over ten years.

89
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,327
Looks like you've gotten a lot
of use out of it.

90
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,096
I travel around a lot.

91
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,166
I'm actually a wandering performer.

92
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,371
I can't tell if you're for real
or just joking.

93
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,106
A lot of people say that about me.

94
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,276
- Been to Mars yet?
- I was born on Mars.

95
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,078
They have everything there.

96
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:38,450
Unlike here, Mars has lots of people,
lots of things...

97
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,085
They must live happily there.

98
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,588
Only the rich.

99
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,225
Then I'm sure we'll be happy there.

100
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:58,137
You planning on escaping to Mars?
Running away... But how far can you go?

101
00:13:58,837 --> 00:13:59,505
Who are you?

102
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,274
An old-fashioned cowboy.

103
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,443
A bounty hunter?

104
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,145
Good call.

105
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,480
You're not going to catch us?

106
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,317
Your buddy seems to be pretty ill.

107
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,986
I don't deal with weakened nobodies.

108
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,555
Wise decision.

109
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,593
You are the nobody.

110
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,101
Asimov. That's enough.

111
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,514
Adios, cowboy.

112
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,363
Why did you stop me?

113
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:02,534
I could have killed him in a second.

114
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,271
You're tired. If you do this anymore...

115
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,106
He was young and attractive.

116
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:14,213
I was waiting for so long
for you to come pick me up.

117
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:17,483
I can finally escape
the lowly life I've had here.

118
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,387
I can finally live happily on Mars.

119
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,302
A nap. How peaceful.

120
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,672
- I had a good dream.
- That's great.

121
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,943
You can see the rest of that dream
on the <i>Bebop.</i>

122
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,944
I'm giving up on this one.

123
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:47,980
It's impossible to catch him.

124
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,149
There's no way we can win.

125
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:54,153
When Asimov left his syndicate,
he snuck something out with him.

126
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:59,458
The top-end stuff of all the illegal
eye drops that the syndicate makes.

127
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:04,330
He took off with all of the drops,
so, the group is in a mess.

128
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,232
They wanna catch him,
but all they get back are corpses.

129
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,735
Because Asimov is using it...

130
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:13,138
The eye drops known as Bloody-Eye.

131
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,474
They're planning on going to Mars.

132
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,608
Mars?

133
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,677
But before that, they'll sell this off.

134
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:23,148
- That's...
- I grabbed it from his breast pocket.

135
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,384
You... met him?

136
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,086
A nightmare.

137
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,521
He got you?

138
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:33,425
The red-eyed coyote will supposedly appear
at the north end of town.

139
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:57,016
This again? Goddamn son of a bitch.

140
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:00,686
Man, you're totally ripping me off,

141
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:04,356
but do you realize the reason
you can eat well around here

142
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,326
is because I cultivated the land
with my buddies, you hear?

143
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,328
Yeah, and that's us.

144
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,263
That we did.

145
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,732
We planted seeds
like there was no tomorrow.

146
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:17,069
You were always planting seeds
of a different kind, though.

147
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,383
Do you have bloody marys?

148
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,185
I only got beer.

149
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,354
I've got tomato juice.

150
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:36,789
How much?

151
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,690
Three hundred thousand woolongs.

152
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,658
I got 50 packs.

153
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,127
Fifteen million Woolongs, eh?

154
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:44,730
I'm in a hurry.
I'll find others if you don't want it.

155
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:46,632
Show me.

156
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,237
Looking for this?

157
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:55,841
Hey, do you know what you are worth?

158
00:17:56,675 --> 00:18:00,279
- What?
- Only 2.5 million woolongs.

159
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,281
You're such a cheap guy.

160
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,518
Long time, no see.

161
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,688
Since when are you a buyer?
Did you give up on bounty hunting?

162
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:13,091
No thrill in cheap bounties.

163
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,694
Looks like you do better as a thief.

164
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,463
Give it back.

165
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,331
Sure, I will.

166
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,632
I owe you one--

167
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,650
You trust your eyes too much.

168
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,687
You're not a chameleon.
You can't see everywhere at once.

169
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:04,810
Let's go!

170
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,312
That way!

171
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:10,716
That way!

172
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,618
What the hell are you--?!

173
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,287
Don't move!

174
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,623
All right, stay still.

175
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:28,534
Idiot!

176
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,803
We're doomed if these break.
Be more careful.

177
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,391
Sorry to keep you waiting.

178
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,193
You're late, Jet.

179
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,228
Shit.

180
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:06,605
Asimov.

181
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,934
Stop! Doing any more is insane.
Don't do it.

182
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:37,869
Don't!

183
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,358
We can't run anymore.

184
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,361
There's no way we can get away.

185
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,605
Hey, Spike, it's ready.

186
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,633
- It's ready.
- What's cooking?

187
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,436
Special beef with bell peppers.

188
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:52,137
<i>Too much time has passed by</i>

189
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:57,042
<i>To lament that we were deeply in love</i>

190
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:04,082
<i>The wind keeps blowing, while my heart</i>

191
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:09,688
<i>Cannot heal all the tears in it</i>

192
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:18,663
<i>Someone cry for me with parched eyes.</i>

193
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,403
<i>The real folk blues</i>

194
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,940
<i>I only want to know</i>

195
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:33,912
<i>What true sadness is</i>

196
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,915
<i>Sitting in muddy water</i>

197
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,152
<i>Isn't such a bad life</i>

198
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:48,627
<i>If it ends</i>

199
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,666
<i>After the first time</i>

200
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:11,950
COMING EPISODE

201
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,986
<i>- This program is finally under way.
- What's the meaning of this?</i>

202
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:18,657
<i>Next week we're completely changing gears
to show an anime for all ages.</i>

203
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,625
<i>Cheerful animals wreak havoc all over.</i>

204
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,828
<i>- What?
- But an animal expert isn't coming.</i>

205
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:24,963
<i>From little kids to the elderly,
if you love animals...</i>

206
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,898
<i>Hold on, Spike.</i>

207
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:31,603
<i>- Everyone gather round and watch the show.
- Is it okay to say stuff like that?</i>

208
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:32,771
<i>But I ask one favor.</i>

209
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:36,942
<i>Good kids should sit far from the TV.
Stand back about a kilometer.</i>

210
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:37,876
STRAY DOG STRUT

211
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,911
<i>- Too far.
- Eight hundred meters, then?</i>
