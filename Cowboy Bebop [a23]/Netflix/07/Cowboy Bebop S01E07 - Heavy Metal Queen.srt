1
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:51,604
VT! Your shift's up?

2
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,773
Finally. How about you?

3
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,342
I'm off to Europa now.

4
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,479
- That's got pretty good pay.
- It's nothing compared to yours.

5
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,782
I heard you made a round-trip
from here to Venus in four days?

6
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,952
- Three days.
- See what I mean?

7
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,654
Anyway, take it easy.

8
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:09,289
Thanks.

9
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,557
Oh yeah, I forgot.

10
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:12,892
VT!

11
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,596
You're still not giving up?

12
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:20,400
Of course not!
How much do you think I lent you?

13
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,535
Suit yourself.

14
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:27,874
All right. You only get one shot,
and you get no clues.

15
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:31,511
Yeah! VT, your name is...

16
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,513
Vivian Tillana.

17
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:36,516
Nope!

18
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:37,483
Oh, man...

19
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,452
This is a bad omen.

20
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,521
You be careful now.

21
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,260
{\an8}Yeah, you know that Cock-Eye guy
that was worth 8 million the other day?

22
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,562
{\an8}Believe it or not,
I was the one who caught him!

23
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,733
What do you mean, the other day?
That was 10 years ago, you old geezer!

24
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:59,005
What are you saying, you young'uns!
I was the one that taught Telpsicorei!

25
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:00,940
You mean the legendary bounty hunter?

26
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,511
Every bounty cowered in fear
just at the mention of his name.

27
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,280
Oh, Everyone knows that.

28
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:18,891
Hey, Zeros.

29
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,728
Welcome, VT. The usual?

30
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:22,695
Yeah.

31
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:25,632
What's going on today?
The place is usually empty.

32
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,267
Oh, this?

33
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,471
Apparently a bounty named Decker
is gonna pass by around here.

34
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,439
They're all bounty hunters.

35
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:37,844
No wonder they all look so cheap.

36
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,613
What was that about
"top secret" information?

37
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,016
This place is full of our kind.

38
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,352
And I got a hangover today, too.

39
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,824
Besides, we don't know the face.
The only clue is a dragon-shaped tattoo.

40
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:53,726
Faye?

41
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,562
Like that place is gonna be any better.

42
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:57,497
WOODY'S P

43
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,565
<i>Welcome to Woody's!</i>

44
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,969
<i>Right now, all of our friends who
are celebrating their birthdays</i>

45
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,905
<i>can get their pictures taken
with Mackey and Mannie!</i>

46
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:09,575
<i>Moms and Dads, please tell your server!</i>

47
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,884
Hi.

48
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,854
What do you want? You wanna get some?

49
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:25,458
I'd rather be the one that gives some.

50
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,427
I'm fine with that.

51
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,362
Hands in the air, Decker!

52
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:36,903
- Don't be so difficult!
- Just get the hell over here.

53
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,371
But I have work!

54
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,006
Just make yourself comfortable!

55
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:40,940
Git!

56
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:42,975
Please, stop.

57
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,644
I'll give you a good time.

58
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:46,813
Stop!

59
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,114
Someone!

60
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,683
What the hell are you?

61
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,884
VT!

62
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:58,658
So, it's a bounty hunter's job to chase
a woman's ass instead of a bounty?

63
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,728
Sorry, but this is my job.

64
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,063
- What...
- Don't play dumb with me.

65
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,766
That dragon-shaped tattoo
is unmistakable proof.

66
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,603
You got the wrong man.

67
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,871
Hey, you over there!

68
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,840
Call the police!

69
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,676
Tell them I caught Decker the bounty!

70
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,860
This is?

71
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,028
Yakkun, the eight-eyed eel.

72
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,698
Don't be so mistakable!

73
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,147
Why you!

74
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,767
You!

75
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:16,803
VT!

76
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,773
You're wearing my patience thin.

77
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,978
What the hell are you?

78
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:29,148
Grudges over lost food
aren't a pretty sight!

79
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,085
Shit, let's get this guy too!

80
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,076
Found him!

81
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,925
Shit, I'll get you back for this!

82
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,596
Just kidding.

83
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,998
Forget about us!

84
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,975
My 12 million...

85
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:35,781
Really. Bounty hunters
are all stupid scum.

86
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:38,117
- You think so?
- Yeah!

87
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:42,688
As far as I know, they're all
living their lives by gambling.

88
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,224
Well, maybe so.

89
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,828
Come over here. I'll treat you to a drink.

90
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:57,103
What? Bean sprouts are good for you!

91
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:03,175
Give me a break! That's all we have!

92
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:04,577
Oh! Here it comes!

93
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,113
Oh, it's you, Faye. That was quick.

94
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:09,315
What!?

95
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,019
But that sure is a disgusting drink.

96
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,054
It's a prairie oyster.

97
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,622
It's good for hangovers.

98
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,997
You're the second person I've met
that drinks that stuff.

99
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,599
And the first one?

100
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,035
My husband.

101
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:30,903
VT!

102
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,839
- We'll get it this time.
- The money!

103
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:35,942
Once for the three of you?

104
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,176
Yeah!

105
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:38,277
Suit yourself.

106
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,315
All right! Here we go!

107
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,718
VT, your name is...

108
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,087
I think Adrienne is good.

109
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,757
That doesn't start with a V.

110
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,695
That's why I said we should stick
with Leticia!

111
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:56,762
You think so?

112
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,165
I can have that money
if I guess your name?

113
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:00,833
Yeah.

114
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,302
I don't remember who started it...

115
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,138
but it kept piling up and here we are now.

116
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:07,974
Can I try, too?

117
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,077
<i>Spike! It's me!</i>

118
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:12,912
<i>Faye let Decker get away.</i>

119
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:14,680
<i>Go after him now.</i>

120
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,020
Spike!

121
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,888
Get lost!

122
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:24,991
Idiotic lying scum!

123
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,659
I ain't treating you!

124
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,299
No, Spike!

125
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,771
Oh, my.

126
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:44,310
{\an8}Oh, this, those whatchamacallit brothers
did this before they took off.

127
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,112
And you were watching?

128
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,050
Why didn't you tell me?

129
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,020
What? I just told you right now!

130
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,128
What?

131
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,003
Hey, VT... going home?

132
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,139
Got a problem with that?
Come on, Zeros.

133
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,781
- And what are you doing?
- Hitchhiking.

134
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,784
My machine was vandalized.

135
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,020
You're really a stupid...

136
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,424
Lying, shameless scum
of a bounty hunter?

137
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,159
If you don't stop with all this...

138
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:43,969
Follow me.

139
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,338
Can I bring someone with me?

140
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,282
Man! How many times
do I have to say the same thing?

141
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:59,118
He was short, bald,
wearing glasses and a Sarasvati.

142
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,853
Huh? What?

143
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,088
I just said...

144
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,292
Really! Can you turn
that shit-loud noise off?

145
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,495
They say, "When in Rome,
do as the Romans do."

146
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,332
And it's not shit-loud noise.

147
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,935
It's called heavy metal!

148
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,383
Really, both of you together...

149
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,420
Who do you think is going
to repair these?

150
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:40,159
What the hell am I supposed to do
with that little bit of information?

151
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,762
How many bald people with glasses
do you think there are in this universe?

152
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:46,432
So I said, bald, short, with glasses...

153
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:50,136
and driving a gaudy truck
with Sarasvati painted on it!

154
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,039
Yeah?

155
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,808
<i>That you, VT?</i>

156
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:57,376
Oh, Otto. What's up?

157
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,378
<i>I got into a hit-and-run.</i>

158
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:04,049
<i>The guy cut in line at the gate entrance,
rammed me, and took off!</i>

159
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,820
<i>Shit, I gotta make him pay for repairs!</i>

160
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,822
<i>Tell me if you see him!</i>

161
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:11,190
<i>Anything specific?</i>

162
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,892
Let's see.

163
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:16,195
There was some oriental
goddess drawn on...

164
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,864
<i>Wait a minute! Was it Sarasvati?</i>

165
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,201
Oh yeah, her. How'd you know?

166
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:24,236
Zeros.

167
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,842
<i>Breaker one-nine, Breaker one-nine.</i>

168
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,544
<i>To all truckers in the asteroid belt.</i>

169
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,546
<i>This is Heavy Metal Queen.</i>

170
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:38,350
<i>Ring me up if you see a gaudy truck
with Sarasvati painted on it. Thanks.</i>

171
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,253
{\an8}<i>VT, this is Love Machine.</i>

172
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:42,955
{\an8}<i>What's up with it?</i>

173
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,057
<i>Some guy you were chasing ran away?</i>

174
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,225
<i>Something like that.</i>

175
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,528
I haven't seen the guy,
but I'll be on the lookout.

176
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,030
<i>Thanks. It'll help.</i>

177
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,434
This is Sneaky Snake.
Did you say it was a painting of a clown?

178
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:56,902
<i>Nope.</i>

179
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:59,538
<i>This is Spider Mike,
Black Panther of Jupiter.</i>

180
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:04,276
<i>VT, I've never met you but I hear lots
of rumors about the Heavy Metal Queen.</i>

181
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,612
Thanks for the compliment. So, any info?

182
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:10,516
I passed by someone like the one you're
looking for 10 minutes ago.

183
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,618
It was around the Linus mines.

184
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:14,520
<i>That help?</i>

185
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:17,223
Thanks, I'll owe you one.

186
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,967
I gotta exchange this, too.

187
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,882
There he is!

188
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,126
Trying to throw me off his trail.

189
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,230
Maybe in the next century!

190
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:13,245
Hey, is the stupid, lying, shameless
scum of a bounty hunter around?

191
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,414
What!? The Linus mines!?

192
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,983
- You're being reckless!
<i>- What did you say?</i>

193
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:19,952
Stay away from Decker!

194
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,553
His cargo is dangerous!

195
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,022
Hey!

196
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:30,429
Wait! I called first dibs on Decker!

197
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,607
What is this? Really?
Do I have to put this silly thing on?

198
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:45,010
I would've preferred that it was
your loud mouth that broke.

199
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:46,578
I heard that.

200
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,447
I'm going out, Jet!

201
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,017
Spike, the main gun on that thing
isn't fixed yet!

202
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,354
Nice try, buddy.

203
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,613
What is this? Isn't this a little risky?

204
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,215
This way!

205
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,161
My 12 million...

206
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,368
<i>Hey, are you alive?</i>

207
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,669
<i>If you hear me, answer!</i>

208
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:21,440
<i>I'm fine. It takes more
than that to kill me.</i>

209
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,574
We gotta run. Now!

210
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,210
<i>Decker was a master of explosives.</i>

211
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:28,380
<i>He's currently hauling the solid nitro
he was making deals with.</i>

212
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,685
All of it? That's enough to blow up
this entire asteroid!

213
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,355
<i>On top of it,
this place was an excel mine.</i>

214
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:39,458
<i>The reactors have been randomly
exploding for a while now.</i>

215
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,497
We gotta get this truck out of here.

216
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,121
<i>How much further is the exit?</i>

217
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:10,289
<i>A little further.</i>

218
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,824
<i>Twenty degrees to the left.</i>

219
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,166
There, the exit.

220
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:28,373
No good.

221
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,641
Behind us!

222
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,179
No! In front!

223
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,452
<i>What's with that?
That's nowhere near enough!</i>

224
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:41,753
My main gun is busted!

225
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,188
This is all I got!

226
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,624
<i>And this is all I have!</i>

227
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,460
What are we gonna do?
Isn't there another way?

228
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,195
<i>Yeah, there is.</i>

229
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,699
There's a ton of it in
the truck behind us!

230
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:00,806
<i>I don't like this.</i>

231
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,642
<i>I'm not one for delicate operations
like this!</i>

232
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,644
Quit whining.

233
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,246
Let's hit it big!

234
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,320
<i>Yeah, now grab one.</i>

235
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,289
That's easy for you to say.

236
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,195
<i>Something is leaking.</i>

237
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,630
<i>That's probably the stabilizer.</i>

238
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,697
<i>That means...</i>

239
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,367
<i>- Touch-sensitive.
- Wait a sec!</i>

240
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,240
<i>At worst, you screw up and die.</i>

241
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:44,283
<i>I got one.
What do you want to do with it?</i>

242
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:49,421
<i>This pod will shoot towards the exit
and self-destruct in 40 seconds.</i>

243
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,725
<i>So, get that thing in this pod
within 40 seconds.</i>

244
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,761
What are you going to do?

245
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,429
I'm gonna do... this.

246
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,678
Zeros, we're opening the hatch!

247
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,681
Bingo!

248
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:14,673
It's clear!

249
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,492
This sucks.

250
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:46,638
Really...

251
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:54,846
Thanks for the help, Victoria Telpsicorei.

252
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,482
And give your husband my thanks.

253
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,851
I figured out your name because of this.

254
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,456
Unless you're a hermit,
everyone knows about him.

255
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,827
{\an8}About the legendary bounty hunter, Telpsicorei.

256
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,832
It will be a while.

257
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,869
My husband's working in Heaven right now.

258
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,538
I see.

259
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:23,809
Give the rest to your husband.

260
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,378
I'm sure he's suffering from a hangover.

261
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:30,082
So, I'll treat him to a prairie oyster.

262
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,986
<i>Once in a while,
I'll do the preview by myself.</i>

263
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,589
<i>I'm Jet Black, 36 years old.</i>

264
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,092
<i>I'm often told that I don't look 36...</i>

265
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:24,863
<i>but you shouldn't judge people by
their looks or how much hair they have.</i>

266
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:27,065
<i>Things are never what they seem to be.</i>

267
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:31,837
<i>The next episode is like that, too.
A fairy tale that seems very unlike Bebop.</i>

268
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,806
<i>Next episode: Waltz for Venus.</i>

269
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,242
<i>Stuff like this is good once in a while.</i>
