1
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:21,174
Welcome back. And how was it?

2
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,344
- They were just thugs!
- Nothing to do with the syndicate.

3
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,512
- Just a salaried employee.
- They just wanted money...

4
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,413
They went to the cops penniless!

5
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:30,550
Then, what?

6
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:36,356
All of you caught the criminals, but no
clue about the bounty we're really after?

7
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,746
They still use paper
just for all the complaints.

8
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,648
Damn it, they're just harassing us.

9
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,416
It's a waste
of valuable resources!

10
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,386
The e-mail server is down
from the sheer number of complaints.

11
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:10,256
There is a movement out there
to sue our company for damages.

12
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,393
What the hell
are the bounty hunters doing?

13
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,395
We already have a huge bounty on him!

14
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,529
Yes, however...

15
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,237
<i>Amigo!</i>

16
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,873
<i>All you bounty hunters in the
Sol system, how are y'all doing?</i>

17
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,808
<i>Once again, it's time for</i> Big Shot!

18
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,910
<i>We'll start with today's hot news!</i>

19
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,514
<i>They apprehended the culprit
in the series of recent Gate assaults!</i>

20
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:37,717
<i>Really? The bounty on him
was 12 million Woolongs, right?</i>

21
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,920
<i>But the weird thing is that
20 culprits were apprehended!</i>

22
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,221
<i>What do you mean?</i>

23
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:45,858
<i>Apparently, they were all caught in
the act, but none were the mastermind.</i>

24
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,662
<i>Then you don't get the reward
unless you find that mastermind?</i>

25
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:50,897
<i>But of course!</i>

26
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,400
<i>Oh, my. I feel sorry for all the guys
who caught the culprits!</i>

27
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:01,341
Why the hell do these
thugs that normally

28
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:04,310
just rob convenience stores
attack at the Gates?

29
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,613
Maybe there are fads in crimes?

30
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:11,718
Like, "Hyperspace Gates are the in thing
among today's fashion-conscious kids!"

31
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:15,922
You assault at least
one Gate or something?

32
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,262
Hey, guys.

33
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,865
Why don't we trade the information
that we each have?

34
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,601
And split the bounty three ways.

35
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,769
What do you mean?

36
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,704
You're the one that started all this,

37
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,040
saying we should research
this case on our own.

38
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:38,845
You also said that the occasional rivalry
between comrades would be good for us.

39
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,614
Come on, did the reward amount
make you lose your memory?

40
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:45,918
What? You guys were really
keen on the idea, too!

41
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:50,723
After all, we all wanted
the bounty to ourselves, right?

42
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,752
<i>In this case, all 20 cases
were done the same way,</i>

43
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,758
<i>All of them infiltrated
the tollbooth...</i>

44
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:31,564
<i>deftly attached the hacking unit...</i>

45
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,003
<i>and in the exact moment that passing
ships access the tollbooth</i>

46
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,004
<i>to pay the toll,</i>

47
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,507
<i>they steal the entire
balance from the credit card.</i>

48
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:46,879
<i>Furthermore, the unit automatically
sent the money data that it just stole.</i>

49
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,616
<i>It immediately launders all the funds
in a bank on Europa,</i>

50
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:53,653
<i>making it impossible
to track where it went.</i>

51
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,757
<i>All the culprits that were caught
in the act have nothing in common.</i>

52
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:01,794
<i>Age, gender, nationality,
religion, criminal record...</i>

53
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:06,466
And on top of it, nobody has any
of the money that they supposedly stole.

54
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,469
Well, that's about all I know.

55
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:10,870
How about you?

56
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,672
The guy that I nabbed said

57
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:17,510
that he was just following instructions
from a manual he got through mail-order.

58
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:21,647
Perhaps the other culprits are
reading the same manual that he was.

59
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,116
Manual?

60
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:27,620
This.

61
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,391
"A new criminal support software.

62
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:36,462
Right now, it's a real bargain.
For the low introductory price

63
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:39,098
{\an8}of 30,000 Woolongs,
you too can be rich!"

64
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,434
What the hell?

65
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,503
It's not easy to be a thief nowadays.

66
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:46,806
I'm sure there are people
who want manuals to help them.

67
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,741
And where is this mail-order company?

68
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:52,145
It's a store that's only on the net,
so I don't know where it was.

69
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,580
Besides, the store has already closed.

70
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,950
Spike, how about you?

71
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,953
The hacking unit that was placed
on the Gates was something

72
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:03,890
that couldn't be made unless you knew
the system really well.

73
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,661
The mastermind's likely someone who has
some connection to the Gate Corporation.

74
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,697
That was my hunch,
and I investigated that front.

75
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,699
The programmers would be fishy.

76
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:18,204
But the guys from the Gate Corporation
suddenly became uncooperative.

77
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,808
It was as if they knew something,
but didn't want us to find out.

78
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:32,985
Are you dead?

79
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,036
Where were we?

80
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:56,976
Well, I guess those are the only clues
we have for now.

81
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,011
Give me that.

82
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:00,079
Give me.

83
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:02,849
Yeah.

84
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:11,224
This is a memory cartridge
for playing chess over the net.

85
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,060
This piece has one match in its memory.

86
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,064
And when you push it,
it connects to the net.

87
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,533
See?

88
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:24,837
And this has something
to do with this incident?

89
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,572
Nothing at all.

90
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,977
Maybe all of this is a game.

91
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,280
For now, continue playing
that game with the opponent.

92
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:35,214
Yup.

93
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,283
I'll go talk to the corporation once more.

94
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,818
Lesse.

95
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:43,689
Eenie, meenie, miny, moe.

96
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,727
Play ball!

97
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:09,582
Another bounty hunter?
I don't care, send him back.

98
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:13,619
But he's asking about
a chess-loving programmer.

99
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:14,554
What?

100
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:17,557
Jet!

101
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,162
What, Jonathan,
were you another one

102
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,898
that went through all the trouble
to get nothing?

103
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,903
This thing isn't that easy.

104
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,242
I believe we have given
out all the information.

105
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,745
What more are you saying
you would like to know?

106
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,819
Sorry, but there is no smoking
allowed in this building.

107
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,055
I'm so sorry.

108
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:53,059
Actually I had something
that I wanted you to see.

109
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,160
What is it?

110
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,832
This is a planned game.

111
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,970
You guys at the Gate Corporation
should know what this means.

112
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:10,042
I mean, to put a bounty on a mastermind
that we aren't even sure exists

113
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:15,848
suggests that it's someone you don't
want the police to know about, no?

114
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,887
Bounty hunters should just look
for their bounties.

115
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,691
I don't know who you are,
and whether you used to work for

116
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:28,227
the ISSP, but it's better for you
to not make inquiries.

117
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:30,396
He's going home.

118
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,832
Make sure he is kindly escorted
out of here.

119
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,408
Damn this old piece of shit!

120
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,411
<i>I believe our risk is too great.</i>

121
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,747
<i>If that gets out to
the general public...</i>

122
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,016
<i>I am fully aware of our risk.</i>

123
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,786
<i>If we don't catch him,
the situation will just get worse.</i>

124
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:58,224
<i>But why is a ghost from 50 years ago
coming back now?</i>

125
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,827
<i>To think that he gave
everyone a chess piece...</i>

126
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,897
<i>Chessmaster Hex.</i>

127
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,901
<i>So, it is a game that he set up.</i>

128
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,438
Chessmaster Hex.

129
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:48,340
No good. This doesn't have anything
other than chess data in it.

130
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,943
I wonder what they were going
to do with this.

131
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:56,415
If there is no meaning to the content,
maybe the pieces are the message.

132
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,753
Great, great!

133
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,329
{\an8}<i>Spike, I have a name.
Can you investigate the guy?</i>

134
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,333
<i>He might be the mastermind
behind this whole thing.</i>

135
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,768
Hey, Ed.

136
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,470
Ed's really busy right now.

137
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:27,813
Here, here!

138
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,815
Checkmate!

139
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,018
Or so you thought!

140
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,187
I'll fork the king and the rook!

141
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:46,799
Indeed! This is either
an idiot or a genius!

142
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,467
I like this chap!

143
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,974
Chessmaster Hex.
Estimated to be 98 years old.

144
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,378
A programmer that had been
dubbed a genius from his teens.

145
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:04,783
In the Cosmo-net chess tournaments, he
dominated the champion's seat for decades.

146
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:09,155
He began work on the Hyperspace Gate
control program when he was 30

147
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:13,559
and created the central control
system that all Gates use to this day.

148
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,363
However, that was his fatal error.

149
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,000
He doubted the safety
of the Gates he helped create

150
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,135
and was against putting
them to practical use.

151
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,137
He was banned
from the Gate Corporation.

152
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,473
His whereabouts
have been unknown for 50 years.

153
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,476
So, he's the mastermind behind
our current string of crimes.

154
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,443
What do you mean?

155
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:35,247
I mean, why is he seeking revenge
50 years after the fact?

156
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,050
If we figure out where he is,
we'll know for sure.

157
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,051
Hey, Ed.

158
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,053
Ed's really busy right now.

159
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,556
Hey, you, quit playing games
and help out a little.

160
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,330
Ed, we want to figure out
where a guy named Hex is.

161
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,201
Hex... Hex... The Chessmaster?

162
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,503
That's who I'm playing
chess against right now!

163
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:15,321
We're almost at the location we got from
the trace we did on Ed's chess opponent.

164
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,223
You guys standing by?

165
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,158
I really don't like this.

166
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,027
I mean, he's basically giving
us his exact location.

167
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,530
Can we even trust that trace
in the first place?

168
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:29,034
- You think he'd be in a dump like this?
- No, I think it was... that.

169
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,039
<i>I heard there was a place
where all the scrapped remains of</i>

170
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:39,478
<i>obsolete Gates were gathered along with
scrap metal and abandoned spaceships</i>

171
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:43,048
<i>and that there were people
that started living there.</i>

172
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,051
<i>Why the hell do they want
to live here of all places?</i>

173
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:49,088
<i>That area has no nationality,
nor a government.</i>

174
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,023
<i>You don't have to pay taxes,</i>

175
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,125
<i>and there are no cops.</i>

176
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:57,029
<i>I see. It's the perfect
place to hide yourself.</i>

177
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:12,678
<i>It might be a trap...</i>

178
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,147
<i>This might be the continuation
of the game.</i>

179
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,149
Whatever happens, happens.

180
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,200
Looks like we have air.

181
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:10,969
<i>Then there is someone here.</i>

182
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,974
<i>Yo, Jet.</i>

183
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:17,042
Jonathan!

184
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,978
How the hell did you get here?

185
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,580
<i>Thanks for leading the way.</i>

186
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,350
You were following us
the whole time?

187
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:28,721
<i>Tough luck for you, but I have
important business with that guy.</i>

188
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:39,732
<i>So, I'll be going ahead.</i>

189
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,032
What the...?

190
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:30,516
How the hell...?

191
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:41,760
What is this?

192
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,500
What is this?

193
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,283
Hi!

194
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,685
Peace to the world.

195
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:08,687
And love to my bank account!

196
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:09,688
You want one?

197
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,095
Wow! Amazing!

198
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,108
Chessmaster Hex?

199
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,276
All right, give up!

200
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:33,812
You guys.

201
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,516
Can you be a little quieter?

202
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:40,886
Old man!

203
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,556
Don't joke with me!

204
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,258
Hey, wait a minute.

205
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,560
You won't get away with pretending
to be senile!

206
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,561
Who are you?

207
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,630
If you don't hand over
the money you stole,

208
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,799
you'll get a nice hole in your brain!

209
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,569
That's a big tube you got there.

210
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,838
Hey, what are you doing, Hex?

211
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,909
You gotta hear this. It's my first
formidable opponent in quite a while!

212
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:07,412
Must be some player
if you have trouble winning!

213
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,781
But before that, where's lunch?

214
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,184
What are you saying?
You just ate a while back!

215
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,619
Oh, is that so?

216
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,688
- Really, you've lost so much of your mind
- Who are these guys?

217
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:19,591
- that all you do is play!
- Don't know. But this old fogey...

218
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:24,396
- Have you lost it?
- Like you can speak...

219
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,900
To think my life savings
are never coming back.

220
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,368
Damn... Goddamn it.

221
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:32,704
Anyone and everyone,
you and that guy over there.

222
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,908
The world is all a mistake!

223
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:53,759
What are we gonna do?
This old man doesn't seem

224
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,695
to remember anything about
yesterday, let alone 50 years ago!

225
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:58,530
That's right.

226
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,632
Hex is no longer here.

227
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,270
Here we merely have an old man
that loves games.

228
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,977
Back then, Hex was riled up
for revenge, and planned this all out.

229
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:16,215
He made it so that this incident
would happen 50 years later

230
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,618
during the one moment that the Gate
program gets automatically updated.

231
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,222
Even making those that
physically commit the crime

232
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,657
hold chess pieces to hint
that it was his doing.

233
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,429
However, to that old-timer,
50 years was too long.

234
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,431
He went senile,

235
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:35,767
and completely forgot about
the traps that he himself had set.

236
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:40,772
Well, it works out better
for you this way.

237
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,609
Because now you don't
have to worry about

238
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,278
the fundamental defect
in the Gates leaking out.

239
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:52,517
Although the price you paid was
that we learned about that defect.

240
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:54,953
What do you want? Money?

241
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:59,891
Or are you planning to leak
this information to the press?

242
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:05,597
Just leave that old guy alone.

243
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,766
That's all I want.

244
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,969
It's a good deal, isn't it?

245
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:17,609
Ed would get lonely
if she lost her chess partner.

246
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,717
You're playing that thing again?

247
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:28,720
Not again. Still.

248
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,921
Still?

249
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,524
You've been playing that thing all week?!

250
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:33,525
Yeah.

251
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,027
I see.

252
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,496
Well, good luck.

253
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,769
Yo, newcomer. You seem happy today.

254
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:44,770
Hi!

255
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,306
He's a really easygoing fellow, isn't he?

256
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,674
That he is.

257
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,077
Checkmate.

258
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,553
I lost.

259
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:50,535
<i>Too much time has passed by</i>

260
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:55,440
<i>To lament that we were deeply in love</i>

261
00:22:57,442 --> 00:23:02,481
<i>The wind keeps blowing, while my heart</i>

262
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:07,886
<i>Cannot heal all the tears in it</i>

263
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:16,862
<i>Someone cry for me with parched eyes.</i>

264
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,602
<i>The real folk blues</i>

265
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:27,139
<i>I only want to know</i>

266
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:32,110
<i>What true sadness is</i>

267
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,113
<i>Sitting in muddy water</i>

268
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,550
<i>Isn't such a bad life</i>

269
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:46,825
<i>If it ends</i>

270
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:52,864
<i>After the first time</i>

271
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,884
<i>Love. It is to believe everything.</i>

272
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,152
<i>Hey, now, are you serious?</i>

273
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,454
<i>Love. It is the heart
that provides for all.</i>

274
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:18,490
<i>Come on, was that what
the story was about?</i>

275
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,625
<i>Love. It is the heart
that accepts everything.</i>

276
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:24,663
<i>- You know, this is getting fishy.
- Whitney. You loved me that much.</i>

277
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:27,032
<i>You really can't trust
the previews on this show.</i>

278
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,601
<i>A romantic love story
for all you lovers.</i>

279
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,504
<i>Next episode: "My Funny Valentine."</i>

280
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:33,505
<i>I'm sure it's a lie.</i>

281
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:35,006
<i>Yeah, a lie. A lie.</i>
