1
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:57,584
Someone's here!

2
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:01,855
Hello there! You approaching
this area, can you see me?

3
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,357
I'm a little troubled
because I'm out of gas.

4
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,426
Can you take me to Ganymede?

5
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:16,503
Oh, damn it, why does everyone...?
Why won't they stop?!

6
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,213
This sea rat

7
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,283
used to be raised in the oceans
of Ganymede.

8
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,220
After the gates stabilized,
food was no longer scarce.

9
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,457
And so, now the ones in the wild get eaten
by those who have a fancy for them.

10
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,393
So, is it good?

11
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,662
It's totally disgusting.

12
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,831
It's just expensive because
it's a Ganymede specialty.

13
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:22,702
Then it's no good.
I'll have the lobster miso stew.

14
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,605
<i>Thank you.</i>

15
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,874
That doesn't look good, either.

16
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:30,643
Well, I thought I'd go for something
expensive while I'm at it.

17
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,646
You mean, because we'll soon
have some money?

18
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,659
To think that Gould was a spy...

19
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:51,464
But, Mom, don't worry.
We sunk his ship.

20
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:56,302
It's all right. One vial nowadays
doesn't mean much...

21
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,342
Let's continue the deal
as we initially planned.

22
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:06,546
But... who was in charge
of watching the house, then?

23
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,649
Mom...

24
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:10,950
It was you, Harrison?

25
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:17,624
Mom...

26
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,526
Hey! Where's my sea-rat sautÃ©?!

27
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,770
{\an8}Come on, there, come on!

28
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,539
No doubt. It's Morgan.

29
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,776
Then shall we go before
we get breakfast?

30
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,416
Hey, kid, did you know
that the Ganymede sea rat

31
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,853
is a very intelligent
and kind animal?

32
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,390
- What's that?
- That woman... I think she was...

33
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:54,060
I don't remember ordering a circus!

34
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:15,081
I know I've seen her somewhere...

35
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:30,897
<i>We, the Space Warriors, work night
and day to preserve the environment</i>

36
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:34,634
<i>and protect endangered species
all over the universe.</i>

37
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,744
I remember now!
That lady's worth 25 million!

38
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:49,549
Mom, hurry!

39
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,085
This is the end, mademoiselle.

40
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:53,720
Mom?!

41
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,754
Don't move!

42
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,823
Do you want to see your mom in pain?

43
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:58,491
Who are you?

44
00:05:58,624 --> 00:05:59,726
How's Morgan?

45
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:02,962
He's full of holes.

46
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,399
That's a problem.
He was gonna put food on our table.

47
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,636
But he's worth nothing compared
to the 25 million that you're worth...

48
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,673
- You!
- Let go of Mom!

49
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,576
Stop it. These guys are bounty hunters.

50
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,444
We can't do anything.

51
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:19,746
Mom!

52
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,815
Take care of the home.
I'll be back soon.

53
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:27,453
Come on. If you don't go now,
the cops are gonna arrive!

54
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,721
Mom, sit tight!

55
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:32,058
Harrison, you'll get plenty
of punishment later.

56
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:33,860
Mom?!

57
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,495
- Let's go!
- Mom!

58
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:39,098
Lucky you, Harrison.
Your mom won't be back for a while.

59
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,041
Hey, are you alive?!

60
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:55,615
Please... Take this to the ISSP...

61
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,652
But... don't open it...

62
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:03,623
Hey, wait a minute!

63
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:06,893
What does he want me to do?

64
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,570
{\an8}Universal Environmental
Protection Society?

65
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,773
{\an8}More like environmental terrorists.

66
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,742
They're called the Space Warriors.

67
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,711
They used to be a good group
working on environmental preservation

68
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,814
and the protection
of endangered species.

69
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:31,651
But since their leader changed two years
ago, their focus drastically changed.

70
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,853
There are only a few members,
but now

71
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,690
they're even worse than a lot
of syndicates out there.

72
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,861
They're especially keen on protecting
the Ganymede sea rats.

73
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:48,134
And she's the leader of this terrorist
group: Twinkle Maria Murdock.

74
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,704
Please, don't associate us
with terrorists!

75
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,709
We are warriors of peace,
fighting for the law of nature.

76
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:57,844
Yeah, yeah.

77
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,247
And where can we get
the 25 million in reward?

78
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,517
The Ganymede government.
But we can't cash in.

79
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,688
I'm checking on it.

80
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,090
The government canceled
the reward yesterday.

81
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:12,491
Why?

82
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,904
When you're told not to open it,
the more you want to...

83
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,075
I didn't open it!

84
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,510
This thing opened by itself!

85
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:53,799
<i>So, as you requested,
we have canceled the bounty.</i>

86
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,069
<i>And we are debating
about prohibiting</i>

87
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,138
<i>the fishing of sea rats
on Ganymede as well.</i>

88
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,874
So, where's Mom?

89
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:06,846
<i>As I said, we haven't gotten word
of Twinkle's capture!</i>

90
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,981
<i>If we can find out
who captured them...</i>

91
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,184
If Mom doesn't come back,

92
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:15,721
we'll set that plan into action immediately.

93
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:19,759
<i>Wait! We're not going
against your wishes...</i>

94
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,868
Doesn't look like it
would ease my hunger...

95
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:38,811
Wait a minute, that terrorist act
we saw isn't on the records, either!

96
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,112
What's going on?

97
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,951
See? I told you that you
couldn't do anything.

98
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,720
So, you can just let me go.

99
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,357
I don't get it...
There's something behind all this.

100
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:59,065
<i>Hello there! You approaching
this area, can you see me?</i>

101
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,135
<i>I'm a little troubled
because I'm out of gas...</i>

102
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,037
Hey, she's--!

103
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:08,741
Can you take me to Ganymede?

104
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,179
<i>Please?</i>

105
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,650
<i>Even getting a little propellant
would be wonderful!</i>

106
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:24,991
Hey! Can you hear me or what?!

107
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,208
Then what?

108
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:46,879
You spent all the money you took from us
at the casino?!

109
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,116
As they say, "Money makes
the world go round."

110
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,852
They also say,
"Thieves have no compassion."

111
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:54,954
How is it over there?

112
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:58,090
Yeah, I'm contacting an old friend.

113
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,861
Man, there isn't even
anything worth keeping...

114
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:03,896
Huh? What's this?

115
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,303
Yes... I still don't know
where that virus is.

116
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:13,272
Yes, Mr. President.

117
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,741
We will continue to do our best!

118
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,213
<i>- Chief!</i>
- What?

119
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:24,884
<i>- The one who nabbed Twinkle...</i>
- You found them?!

120
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:29,955
And, that guy told you
to take this to the ISSP?

121
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,992
Yup. Doesn't that look
like it's worth something?

122
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:35,428
So, how about we call it even?

123
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,164
I never trust anything thieves say.

124
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:40,900
What?

125
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,736
What's all this about?! Hey, Bob!!

126
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,404
<i>Nothing is really up.</i>

127
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,773
<i>The bounty has been canceled.</i>

128
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,077
<i>They're saying you should
let her go immediately,</i>

129
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,312
Hey, Bob...

130
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,182
<i>When we worked in
the same department...</i>

131
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:59,318
<i>...a lot of the confiscated
eye drops disappeared, you know?</i>

132
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,887
What do you wanna say?

133
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,390
<i>If you wanna work
until retirement age,</i>

134
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,060
<i>isn't it a better idea for you
to go along with me?</i>

135
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,933
Oh, all right.
I get what you're saying.

136
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,039
Hey, don't break it!

137
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:26,345
<i>The guys are threatening
under the mask of negotiation.</i>

138
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,149
<i>They're holding the 8 million residents
of Ganymede hostage.</i>

139
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:31,417
What do you mean by that?

140
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:35,488
They basically kidnapped
the leader in virus technology

141
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,390
and created a virus to their liking.

142
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,827
{\an8}<i>The virus is called Monkey Business.</i>

143
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,063
{\an8}<i>They say that humans and monkeys</i>

144
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:47,099
<i>only have a 2 percent difference
in DNA structure</i>

145
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:51,804
<i>and apparently this virus
acts on those two percent.</i>

146
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:57,977
<i>So, that virus selectively,
acts only on humans.</i>

147
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:05,184
Why don't you give up?

148
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,424
We lost contact with the ISSP spy
that infiltrated their group.

149
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,393
So, we had no other option.

150
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:17,897
So you're going to agree
to their terms?!

151
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,169
Man, this was a big one
that we caught, too!

152
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:26,238
It's orders from up above!
WE couldn't do anything about it!

153
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,112
We're releasing her.

154
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,909
Us... or them...

155
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,179
Which one of us deserves
punishment from heaven?

156
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:10,115
Soon, the time of judgment
will arrive.

157
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,319
Yes... Soon...

158
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,330
The release procedure
has been completed.

159
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,565
We will continue to monitor
her using our special agents.

160
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,133
How's the satellite?

161
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,868
It will be ready in about an hour.

162
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,270
Get the chemical tech group as well.

163
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,573
Don't do anything until we know
where the virus is.

164
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:37,076
Sir, a communication from Twinkle.

165
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,280
<i>Long time no see, Minister.</i>

166
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,983
<i>About that promise we made...</i>

167
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:47,353
So, about the sea rats,
we will keep a stable population

168
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,656
using limitations
on hunting them.

169
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,892
<i>Didn't I say prohibition of hunting?</i>

170
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,597
Well, we will look at the demands
in a positive light.

171
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,137
<i>Looks like you need some punishment
to understand.</i>

172
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,439
Hey! Wait!

173
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,676
Mom! I don't want to become a monkey!
Mom!

174
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,530
<i>Alpha 1-0-5 to headquarters.</i>

175
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,133
<i>The target has entered
the wasteland area.</i>

176
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,937
Roger. Continue pursuit.

177
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,386
Man, they're too easy-going.

178
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,214
Damn it...

179
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,451
All that and no reward...

180
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,221
<i>Jet, can you hear me?</i>

181
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,156
<i>Turn on channel 72 and watch it!</i>

182
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,394
<i>They're broadcasting
from their own satellite!</i>

183
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,064
<i>This isn't just about the sea rats.</i>

184
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,100
<i>Humans, with their culture</i>

185
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,470
<i>have escaped from
the great system of nature</i>

186
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,540
<i>and are committing crimes
that cannot be amended.</i>

187
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,243
<i>Those that don't realize this</i>

188
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,380
<i>are what you could call "bugs"
in the nature system.</i>

189
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,224
That ship was a decoy.

190
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:06,792
Where are they broadcasting from?

191
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:11,463
It's near here. They're in hyperspace!

192
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:15,567
<i>Monkey Business, our virus,</i>

193
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:20,072
<i>takes such humans
and returns them to nature.</i>

194
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,440
<i>Understand?</i>

195
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,287
<i>Good news, Jet!</i>

196
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,791
<i>The Ganymede government has reestablished
the ransom on Twinkle and company.</i>

197
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,426
What?!

198
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,362
This is our chance!
We're the only ones around here!

199
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,265
<i>But just catching them won't do.</i>

200
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:52,204
<i>If the missile falls, there'll be
nobody here that can pay the bounty</i>

201
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,220
So there's nothing to bitch about
if we get rid of the missile, right?

202
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,123
But they're at the exit to a gate.

203
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:12,424
I know.

204
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,605
- What about the defense system?!
- 4 minutes and 30 seconds to impact!

205
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,273
The system won't make it in time!

206
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,577
This is an emergency!
Get the president!

207
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:37,382
They're here.

208
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,263
It split?! Shit!

209
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,613
Jet! Get the last one!

210
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,648
What?! There aren't any weapons
over here!

211
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,685
If I wait for the next shot to fully
charge, that thing will hit Ganymede!

212
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,888
<i>Oh? Are you in trouble?</i>

213
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:20,292
<i>- How about for 80 percent of the earnings?</i>
- You've got to be kidding!

214
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:24,530
<i>- Okay, bye! Have a nice day.</i>
- All right. 40 percent. No more.

215
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,633
- Okay! I get the 60!
- Fine... We got no choice.

216
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,376
Shit, will she make it in time?

217
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,546
Welcome!

218
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:48,820
What is this?!

219
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,823
Multiple warheads?!
This ain't the military!

220
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,595
Now all of you, become apes!

221
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:00,465
<i>Jet! The guys from the government
are closing down the gate!</i>

222
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,633
What?!

223
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:04,336
<i>They're going to enclose all of it
in hyperspace, missile and all!</i>

224
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,939
- Wait a minute, this isn't a joke!
<i>- Spike!</i>

225
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,243
I hear you!

226
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:29,828
Spike!

227
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:56,655
Why?

228
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:03,028
<i>Didn't you learn in high school?</i>

229
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:08,834
<i>Matter that gets enclosed
in hyperspace can be seen,</i>

230
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,638
but will never interact with matter
in this realm again.

231
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,577
Mom! The gate's closed!

232
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,946
Hey, Mom, what can we do?!

233
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,447
Stop! Stop!

234
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:45,804
So... this and that and no reward.
All that work for nothing.

235
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:50,776
Oh, don't look so down,
we can make money next time.

236
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,845
Well, I'll go take a shower.

237
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:58,684
Next time? Make money?

238
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:02,421
Hey, Jet, what did she just say?

239
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,723
Don't ask me! Just don't!

240
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,559
And she's off to shower
without asking us.

241
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,362
Hey, are we gonna take all of this?

242
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,798
Don't tell me! Just don't!

243
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,002
Fine, I'll go tell her.

244
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,341
Hey, Spike.

245
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:26,978
Should've seen that coming.

246
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,883
<i>The supposedly broken music box
starts to move</i>

247
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:13,952
<i>and a nostalgic tune fills the air.</i>

248
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:15,987
<i>I then happen to wake up
from the dream.</i>

249
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,523
<i>There is no such thing
as a music box,</i>

250
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,726
<i>yet, there is a small music box
nestled in my hand.</i>

251
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:24,830
<i>And I awake from the dream again.</i>

252
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:29,234
<i>As if I was peeling an onion,
it's a dream no matter how far I go.</i>

253
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,469
<i>I can never return to reality.</i>

254
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:34,539
<i>Such a nightmare, this is.</i>

255
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:37,242
<i>Next episode: Ballad of Fallen Angels.</i>
