1
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:06,459
You forgot something.

2
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,865
As you can see,
I'm just some old man.

3
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,300
Unfortunately, I don't have any children.

4
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,136
I never said it was yours.

5
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,305
Oh, was it a customer's?
I will hold it, then.

6
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:23,710
How about it?

7
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,278
Wanna go somewhere?

8
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,514
It's a little too early to go to bed.

9
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:30,216
I'm an early riser. I go to sleep early.

10
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:34,154
If you want a prim and proper life,
I have just the place for you.

11
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,590
A hotel where you get three meals
and a bodyguard, all for free.

12
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,859
I'm sure that's impossible
without a reservation.

13
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,529
I'm talking about Hotel Prison,
Teddy Bommer.

14
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:47,333
I'd rather not, Spike Spiegel.

15
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,335
Oh, you know me?

16
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,905
It's a popular story among criminals

17
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:55,241
that we never want to be caught
by you, or by Andy.

18
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,175
Andy?

19
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,779
I will fulfill my objective!

20
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:13,893
It won't blow up.

21
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,229
I took out the ignition pin.

22
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,311
Three million woolongs,
graciously accepted.

23
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,845
That's not the only bear.

24
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:37,784
You'll die, too.

25
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,652
I love them to death.

26
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,888
Why do you want
to blow stuff up so much?

27
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:45,858
You wanna know? I'm giving a warning.

28
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,829
I am ringing a bell of warning!

29
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,532
All right, be mindful of what I say!

30
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,275
Andy.

31
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:12,652
Andy?

32
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,524
Call me Wyatt Earp.

33
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:22,462
You! Teddy Bommer, serial bomber!

34
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:23,396
Me?!

35
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,032
The fact that you'd plant
a bomb here today

36
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:30,803
was easy for me to figure out
after calculating your criminal cycles.

37
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,505
You don't think it's him?

38
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,709
He's a security guard!

39
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,011
Just look at his face!

40
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,514
In this day and age, a face means nothing.

41
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,883
Then what is the basis of your theory?

42
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:44,951
That is--

43
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,854
My gut instinct. Yes, inspiration!

44
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:51,624
Hey, wait!

45
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,759
Wait!

46
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:07,674
Oh, shit.

47
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:11,411
That's why I said
Teddy Bommer was that guy, you idiot!

48
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,645
Dangerous!

49
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,093
That was a close one.

50
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,614
- A horse?
- Yeah, a horse.

51
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:50,616
A horse, huh?

52
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,887
I thought it was fishy when you said
you'd nab that guy as part of your trip.

53
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,422
What do you mean by that?

54
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:58,725
You used the food money for all of us,
didn't you?

55
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,426
- Come on.
- What did you use it on?

56
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:03,429
If you think I'm lying,
explain this on my back!

57
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:04,497
All right, I hear you.

58
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,933
- The horse I can believe.
- You can?

59
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:10,536
But you have to be more creative
than a cowboy in a cowboy outfit.

60
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,004
Is that the problem?

61
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:16,109
- Now, if he was dressed like a samurai...
- That would be more plausible.

62
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,681
Here he is, little Andy!

63
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:25,885
"Little Andy is a guy in the YMCA."

64
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,886
A Christian?

65
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,590
Nope. Young Men's Cowboy Association!

66
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:32,925
Such a thing exists?

67
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,528
But he got kicked out soon after joining.

68
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:36,829
The reason?

69
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,698
Because he caused others trouble!

70
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:39,665
Of course!

71
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:44,504
"Andy von de Oniyate,
the noble son of Oniyate Ranch."

72
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,506
Hey, he's pretty cute.

73
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,975
"A hundred and twenty-three cases
of property damage.

74
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,911
Eighty-nine cases
of destruction of public property."

75
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,479
Many, many people injured.

76
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,047
A good match for someone we know.

77
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,583
- I told you he existed!
- All right, I hear you.

78
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,827
- Any reactions?
<i>- None yet.</i>

79
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:09,595
However...

80
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:13,166
we can't let it explode
with all these people around.

81
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,568
<i>His only target is the building.</i>

82
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,603
<i>He's not one for murder.</i>

83
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,138
You think we can trust him?

84
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,508
<i>Guys like him are often concerned
with their sense of style.</i>

85
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,913
Well, this is the perfect party
to hide yourself.

86
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,120
Did you know that a serial bomber
is gonna come here?

87
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,922
To tell the truth, I didn't know.

88
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,492
Well, he's coming.

89
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:41,994
Hey!

90
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,566
The world is about love and peace!

91
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:51,103
- Yo.
- How did you know it was me?

92
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,873
This lead the way to its papa.

93
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,209
I think I would've known in either case.

94
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,878
You guys just don't quit, do you?

95
00:07:58,878 --> 00:07:59,846
Speak for yourself.

96
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,848
Why do you want
to blow things up so much?

97
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:03,749
You wanna know?

98
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,785
I am giving out a warning.

99
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:09,255
Listen, in this world,
the root of all evil--

100
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:23,769
A horse.

101
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,707
A cowboy.

102
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,280
- Hey, you! Teddy Bommer!
- Me?!

103
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,116
- See, I told you.
- Or is it you over there?

104
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,051
Do you have no memory?!

105
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,020
We met just yesterday!

106
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,556
I have no recollection.

107
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:44,857
You!

108
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,827
Sir, your horse is an inconvenience.

109
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,229
It proves rather troublesome
for our other customers.

110
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:53,165
Oh, my beloved steed, Onyx,
is no ordinary horse!

111
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,234
At times,
she sets my troubled mind at ease,

112
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:58,170
- at others she is my chess partner.
- Like horses play chess!

113
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,939
It doesn't matter either way.

114
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,742
I detest being ignored!

115
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,791
What happened to his sense of style?!

116
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,761
Calm down! I'm telling you to calm down!

117
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,130
Love and peace, man!

118
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,872
Such a lovely horse.

119
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,640
Do you like her?

120
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,109
Would you like to be my escort?

121
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,245
Now, get behind me.

122
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:20,987
You little--

123
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,240
In my life, I've never seen such a...

124
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,342
tasteless room.

125
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:23,315
Now, I present you with my
special son-of-a-gun stew.

126
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,854
I'm sure you'll find it
extremely delicious.

127
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,199
So, why are you a bounty hunter?

128
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:44,336
If you're so rich-- I mean,
if you have so much comfort in your life.

129
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:47,106
Why? Let's see.

130
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,309
Because it suits me.

131
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,047
That feeling a cowboy gets
when he corners a bull.

132
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:03,222
But you don't have to go after
such a dangerous bounty, do you?

133
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,927
I know why nobody wants
to go after Teddy Bommer.

134
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,331
Nobody wants
to get a piece of the explosion.

135
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,066
You think we can worry about that?

136
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,203
Yes! I don't worry about things like that!

137
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:20,873
Once I set my mind on something,
I can see nothing else!

138
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,245
I think I've seen this personality
somewhere before.

139
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:28,981
Oh, nothing.

140
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:30,816
Now!

141
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,185
Here's looking at...

142
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,754
my reflection, kid.

143
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,324
Cheers.

144
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,434
Hi, I got a souvenir.

145
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,940
A souvenir! A souvenir!

146
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,243
I ain't gonna eat that!

147
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,345
Guess this is for dinner.

148
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:00,779
I will not eat that.

149
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,317
Your stomach will suffer.

150
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:10,489
But what about him makes you so hotheaded?

151
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,191
They're too similar.

152
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,994
You know how
similar people hate each other.

153
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,164
What part of me is similar
to that shit-headed idiot?!

154
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,566
The part that makes you damn troublesome.

155
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:26,038
Oh, big shot has already started.

156
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:31,110
{\an8}<i>Well, the last thing we have to tell you
is info about T.B., Teddy Bommer.</i>

157
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,144
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

158
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,580
<i>We got a message from him,
just for this show!</i>

159
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,482
<i>What? Is that for real?</i>

160
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,384
<i>Let's see.</i>

161
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:43,122
<i>"Warning: This is for those
that have made fun of me.</i>

162
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,558
<i>My next job is your last chance.</i>

163
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:49,195
<i>This time, I'll blow you up as well,
like fireworks."</i>

164
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,397
<i>My, my, he doesn't sound calm.</i>

165
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,867
<i>"That is,
if you know where I will set up next.</i>

166
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:59,104
<i>And lastly,
I will tell you my true intent--"</i>

167
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:03,475
<i>Whoops, looks like time is up for us.
That's all for today.</i>

168
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,045
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't read all of it, T.B.</i>

169
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,947
<i>Well, until next time.</i>

170
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,081
<i>Good luck!</i>

171
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,989
The next one's in city hall.

172
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,257
You figured it out already?

173
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,594
T.B. is blowing up tall buildings
starting with the tallest one.

174
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,029
The reason was that simple?

175
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,899
What are you gonna do?
I'm getting out of this one.

176
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,034
I'm gonna pass, too.

177
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,070
Spike, what are you going to do?

178
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:33,472
<i>Like you have to ask?!</i>

179
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,280
Late!

180
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:45,885
Damn it! If they think they can get away
with this, they are sorely mistaken!

181
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:52,358
- You alone?
- How dare you take so long to get here?

182
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,459
Wait!

183
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:56,996
Wrong guy.

184
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,433
I never intended for humans to be targets!

185
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,535
But you guys are different!

186
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,105
Guys like you deserve--

187
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:17,416
He's here.

188
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,022
You! It was you!

189
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,556
So, you finally remember me.

190
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:29,228
- You always--
- You always butt in and get in my way!

191
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,197
You're the one that's in the way!

192
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,234
Now that I have both of you here,
I will tell you.

193
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:38,370
The reason why I continue
to blow buildings up is because--

194
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,006
Today we settle the score
once and for all.

195
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,008
What?! That's my line!

196
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:44,576
Listen to what I have to say!

197
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,011
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

198
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,947
And you are? Who are you?!

199
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,219
Can't you guys put some effort
into your work?!

200
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,193
- We have to catch him first!
- Wait!

201
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,341
<i>You guys take me too lightly.</i>

202
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:19,078
<i>That elevator door will never open again.</i>

203
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,314
<i>And once it starts moving, that's the end.
It will never stop.</i>

204
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:28,454
At the top floor,
my cute little bears will greet you.

205
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,423
So, the moment that the elevator
reaches the top floor...

206
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,058
boom!

207
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:41,400
<i>Well, live what little you have
of your life left without regret!</i>

208
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:44,570
<i>Farewell, and good luck.</i>

209
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,513
Rest assured. I understand.
I know how he does things.

210
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,550
Don't worry. I know how he does--

211
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:02,154
This afternoon,
I reverted the secret emergency code

212
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:05,190
that had been changed. Yeah.

213
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,493
I reverted it this afternoon!

214
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,398
Change after change...

215
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:15,334
means it's back to where it started!

216
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,605
Stop, you idiot!

217
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:22,775
What do we do?! What do we do?! Oh, no!

218
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,489
Stop. Shit. It's too tight!

219
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:40,325
- You are in the way!
- What? Get out of the way, damn it!

220
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,119
Farewell.

221
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:10,589
Come to think of it,
they were brave young men.

222
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,688
They're climbing, those two monkeys.

223
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,257
They like high places.

224
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,159
So, they are similar.

225
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,827
Let's just go back.

226
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:52,331
Then I'll go turn him in.

227
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:04,243
You don't even deserve
to be called a cowboy.

228
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,479
I will never forgive you.

229
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:29,494
I lose.

230
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:31,530
That was some punch.

231
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,368
You are a true cowboy.

232
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,408
As of today, I will no longer be a cowboy.

233
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,278
This really is a hats-off!

234
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,283
So... what are you gonna do now?

235
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:55,520
I will no doubt find a new way of life.

236
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,491
See you, Space Cowboy.

237
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,473
Well, it was only a rich boy's hobby.

238
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:18,377
His level, no, rank,
was really no match for me.

239
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:20,579
Hey, are you listening?

240
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:21,580
Yeah, yeah.

241
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,616
So, he just wasn't any enemy of mine.

242
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,319
Of course,
I never had him in my line of sight.

243
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,292
- Hey, are you listening?
- Yeah, yeah.

244
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:39,931
But, anyway, why did you want
to blow stuff up so much?

245
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,835
I wanted to give a warning...

246
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:49,041
about all the unnecessary waste
created by capitalism lacking philosophy.

247
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,077
Planets that needlessly gets colonized.

248
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,579
Media that needlessly gets circulated.

249
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,449
And buildings that are needlessly tall
to symbolize it all!

250
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,918
And by destroying them, I wanted to raise

251
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:03,822
the question
of how a true pioneer should be.

252
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,424
Wait, wait, wait!

253
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,994
Andy!

254
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,996
Call me Musashi!

255
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,566
Go, Jiroumaru!

256
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:17,703
But...

257
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,772
it was all a waste, wasn't it?

258
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:50,702
<i>Too much time has passed by</i>

259
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:55,841
<i>To lament that we were deeply in love</i>

260
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:02,614
<i>The wind keeps blowing, while my heart</i>

261
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:07,853
<i>Cannot heal all the tears in it</i>

262
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:16,928
<i>Someone cry for me with parched eyes.</i>

263
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:23,802
<i>The real folk blues</i>

264
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:26,671
<i>I only want to know</i>

265
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:32,177
<i>What true sadness is</i>

266
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:35,447
<i>Sitting in muddy water</i>

267
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,784
<i>Isn't such a bad life</i>

268
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:47,159
<i>If it ends</i>

269
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:52,998
<i>After the first time</i>

270
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,619
<i>Did you pay close attention to me
and my wonderful role?</i>

271
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,854
<i>Hey, wait a minute.</i>

272
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:19,191
<i>- Now, the next episode, the next story--
- Why are you doing the preview?</i>

273
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:22,460
<i>Once again, it's time for me, Andy,
to have an active role in the story!</i>

274
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,196
<i>Your turn on the stage is already over!</i>

275
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:25,730
<i>Now that I'm a space samurai,</i>

276
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,033
<i>watch me completely crush cowboys
left and right!</i>

277
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,768
<i>You're not in the show anymore!</i>

278
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:32,204
<i>Next episode of Cowboy Bebop,
"Andy Strikes Back!"</i>

279
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,073
<i>- The title is nothing like that!
- Please look forward to it.</i>
