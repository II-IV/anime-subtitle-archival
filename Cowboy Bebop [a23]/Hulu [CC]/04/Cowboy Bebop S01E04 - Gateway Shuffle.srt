00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,382
- MISSILES AND ALL!
- THIS IS NO JOKE!

344
00:20:26,382 --> 00:20:28,848
SPIKE!

345
00:20:28,848 --> 00:20:31,782
GRR! I HEAR YOU!

346
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,515
GO, SPIKE!

347
00:20:52,848 --> 00:20:55,515
UNH!

348
00:21:10,848 --> 00:21:13,615
WHEW.

349
00:21:13,615 --> 00:21:14,815
HMM? HUH?

350
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,482
WHAT'S THAT?

351
00:21:16,482 --> 00:21:19,648
- AAH!
- OHH!

352
00:21:19,648 --> 00:21:20,882
UNH...

353
00:21:20,882 --> 00:21:22,648
DIDN'T YOU PAY ATTENTION IN
YOUR HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICS CLASS?

354
00:21:24,024 --> 00:21:26,084
MATTER THAT GETS
ENCLOSED IN HYPERSPACE

355
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:29,017
CAN BE VIEWED
NORMALLY BY THE NAKED EYE.

356
00:21:29,017 --> 00:21:31,050
BUT OF COURSE,
IT CAN NEVER INTERACT

357
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,284
WITH THE MATTER ON
THIS PLANE OF REALITY.

358
00:21:37,217 --> 00:21:39,184
MOM! THE GATE'S CLOSED!

359
00:21:39,184 --> 00:21:44,284
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO, MAMA?
STOP! STOP!

360
00:21:45,117 --> 00:21:48,150
UNH!

361
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,850
UGH... UGH...

362
00:21:55,217 --> 00:21:58,050
AH...

363
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,317
OH!

364
00:22:02,184 --> 00:22:04,717
YEAH, YEAH, ALL THAT
WORK AND NO REWARD.

365
00:22:04,717 --> 00:22:07,817
FOR TOUGH GUYS,
YOU SURE COMPLAIN A LOT.

366
00:22:07,817 --> 00:22:09,984
NOW, DON'T TAKE IT
SO HARD, BOYS.

367
00:22:09,984 --> 00:22:11,984
WE'LL MAKE SOME BIG
BUCKS ON THE NEXT ONE.

368
00:22:11,984 --> 00:22:15,850
WELL, I THINK I'LL GO
TAKE A SHOWER NOW.

369
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:16,617
[HUMMING]

370
00:22:16,617 --> 00:22:19,850
NEXT TIME?
"WE'LL" MAKE MONEY?

371
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,950
JET, IS SHE SAYING
WHAT I THINK SHE'S SAYING?

372
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,817
'CAUSE IF SHE IS--

373
00:22:22,817 --> 00:22:25,384
I DON'T KNOW, AND
I HAVE NO OPINION.

374
00:22:25,384 --> 00:22:29,850
MAN... SHE'S TAKING
A SHOWER IN OUR SHOWER.

375
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,484
THAT'S NOT OK, RIGHT?

376
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:34,450
DON'T KNOW.
HAVE NO OPINION.

377
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:39,184
FINE. I'LL GO
TELL HER MYSELF.

378
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:43,417
HMM.
HUH-- WAIT, SPIKE!

379
00:22:43,417 --> 00:22:46,217
[BANG BANG]

380
00:22:46,817 --> 00:22:49,284
BAD MOVE, SPIKEO.

381
00:24:29,818 --> 00:24:32,479
THE MUSIC BOX IS BROKEN...
OR IS IT?

382
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:35,539
IT STARTS TO PLAY, AND A
HAUNTING TUNE FILLS THE AIR.

383
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:39,606
I AWAKE SUDDENLY FROM MY DREAM.
THERE IS NO MUSIC BOX!

384
00:24:39,606 --> 00:24:41,039
AND YET, THERE IT IS

385
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,006
A TINY ONE,
NESTLED IN MY HAND.

386
00:24:43,006 --> 00:24:47,072
AND I AWAKE FROM MY DREAM AGAIN,
AS IF I WERE PEELING AN ONION,

387
00:24:47,072 --> 00:24:50,239
IT'S A DREAM
NO MATTER HOW FAR I GO.

388
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,139
I CAN NEVER REACH REALITY.

389
00:24:52,139 --> 00:24:54,139
TRAPPED IN AN ENDLESS NIGHTMARE.

390
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:57,039
NEXT EPISODE,
BALLAD FOR FALLEN ANGELS.
