IT'S HIS REWARD, FAYE!

358
00:17:26,662 --> 00:17:27,929
I HAVE SOME HISTORY
TO WORK OUT WITH THIS GUY,

359
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:30,629
SO I CLAIM FIRST RIGHTS TO HIM

360
00:17:30,629 --> 00:17:32,095
AND TO THE BOUNTY
THAT'S ON HIS HEAD!

361
00:17:32,095 --> 00:17:34,895
IS IT JUST ME,
OR DID THAT NOT MAKE ANY SENSE?

362
00:17:34,895 --> 00:17:37,962
JUST LIKE I SAID
WOMEN DON'T WORK ON REASON.

363
00:17:37,962 --> 00:17:39,529
GET ME OUT OF HERE!

364
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:41,029
ARE YOU GOING TO
SET HIM FREE OR WHAT?

365
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:42,062
WE'LL SEE!

366
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,462
[GUNSHOT]

[BEEPING]

368
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:46,562
OH, MAN!

369
00:17:46,562 --> 00:17:48,662
UNH!

370
00:17:54,095 --> 00:17:59,129
VISITORS, THANK YOU
FOR YOUR ATTENDANCE!

371
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:04,562
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

372
00:18:04,562 --> 00:18:07,862
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO WITH ME?

373
00:18:07,862 --> 00:18:09,829
I WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

374
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:10,595
HUH?

375
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:11,929
TELL ME, WHO AM I?

376
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:16,929
TELL ME WHERE THE LIES END
AND THE TRUTH BEGINS.

377
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,762
[CRASH]

378
00:18:19,762 --> 00:18:21,995
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

379
00:18:21,995 --> 00:18:26,062
IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL,
I'LL HIT THE COCKPIT.

380
00:18:27,062 --> 00:18:30,062
I'M NOT GOING EASY ON YOU.

381
00:18:31,729 --> 00:18:34,095
I THOUGHT THAT WAS MY LINE.

382
00:18:39,695 --> 00:18:41,662
UNH!

383
00:18:58,562 --> 00:19:00,629
[GASPS]

384
00:19:07,262 --> 00:19:10,229
AAH!

385
00:19:10,229 --> 00:19:14,462
YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY
ARE A BIG PAIN.

386
00:19:21,095 --> 00:19:23,729
WHO AM I?

387
00:19:25,895 --> 00:19:27,529
ARE YOU SURE YOU
REALLY WANT TO KNOW?

388
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:30,195
IT'S GOING TO BE
HARD TO SWALLOW.

389
00:19:31,729 --> 00:19:36,029
ARE YOU PREPARED FOR
ALL THE CONSEQUENCES?

390
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:36,995
I AM.

391
00:19:36,995 --> 00:19:41,095
ARE YOU SURE?

392
00:19:41,095 --> 00:19:41,929
SPIT IT OUT!

393
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:44,095
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
MYSELF. I SWEAR!

394
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:45,095
YOU'RE LYING.

395
00:19:45,095 --> 00:19:47,595
WHO AM I
MY PAST, MY FUTURE?

396
00:19:47,595 --> 00:19:52,029
THESE ARE QUESTIONS EVERY HUMAN
ASKS AT LEAST ONE IN THEIR LIFE.

397
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:52,762
WHO ARE YOU?

398
00:19:52,762 --> 00:19:53,562
HOWEVER, PUBERTY
IS THE ONLY TIME

399
00:19:53,562 --> 00:19:55,229
TO WORRY ABOUT
THINGS LIKE THAT.

400
00:19:55,229 --> 00:19:56,929
ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE BORED

401
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,195
THINK SUCH THOUGHTS
AFTER A CERTAIN AGE.

402
00:19:59,195 --> 00:20:03,062
I'VE HEARD THAT VOICE
BEFORE SOMEWHERE.

403
00:20:03,062 --> 00:20:05,562
HERE I AM. YOOHOO!

404
00:20:05,562 --> 00:20:06,495
OH, GEES.

405
00:20:06,495 --> 00:20:08,695
IS THAT THE DOCTOR
FROM THE CRYO CLINIC?

406
00:20:08,695 --> 00:20:09,862
SURE SEEMS THAT WAY.

407
00:20:09,862 --> 00:20:11,562
YOU TOLD ME THAT
DOCTOR WAS DEAD!

408
00:20:11,562 --> 00:20:12,829
UH, UH, NOT DEAD
I MEAN, NOT COMPLETELY.

409
00:20:12,829 --> 00:20:17,029
HOW MANY LIES ARE YOU GOING TO
TELL ME BEFORE YOU'RE THROUGH?

410
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:18,029
UH, UH, UH...

411
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:21,129
YOU WERE CRYOGENICALLY
PRESERVED IN OUR LABS.

412
00:20:21,129 --> 00:20:21,995
HUH?

413
00:20:21,995 --> 00:20:23,662
THAT IS A VERIFIABLE FACT.

414
00:20:23,662 --> 00:20:24,962
I CAN GUARANTEE IT.

415
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:25,962
HUH?

416
00:20:25,962 --> 00:20:27,095
WHAT ABOUT MY PAST?

417
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:28,062
WHO IN THE WORLD AM I?

418
00:20:28,062 --> 00:20:30,829
ACTUALLY, I GAVE YOU
THE NAME "VALENTINE."

419
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,062
YES, I NAMED YOU AFTER
MY FAVORITE LOVE SONG.

420
00:20:33,062 --> 00:20:34,629
ALL THE OTHER
DATA ON YOU WAS LOST

421
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:35,995
WHEN THE ASTRAL GATE EXPLODED.

422
00:20:35,995 --> 00:20:37,795
SO, YOU SEE,
NO ONE KNOWS WHO YOU ARE

423
00:20:37,795 --> 00:20:42,229
OR WHY YOU WERE PUT
IN A CRYOGENIC STATE.

424
00:20:42,229 --> 00:20:44,995
IS THIS GUY A DOCTOR OR A COP?

425
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:45,962
HUH?

00:20:45,962 --> 00:20:47,095

427
00:20:47,095 --> 00:20:49,729
YOU ARE IN A VEHICLE WHICH
HAS BEEN REPORTED STOLEN.

428
00:20:49,729 --> 00:20:51,962
STATE YOUR DEPARTMENT CODE NOW.

429
00:20:51,962 --> 00:20:53,929
I REPEAT, STATE YOUR CODE.

430
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:55,695
DOCTOR, THIS IS NOT GOOD.

431
00:20:55,695 --> 00:20:56,662
WE'RE GOING TO BE
APPREHENDED HERE.

432
00:20:56,662 --> 00:20:58,629
IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE,

433
00:20:58,629 --> 00:21:01,595
BUT WE'D BETTER CUT OUR
LOSSES AND MAKE TRACKS.

434
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:02,262
GOOD CALL, DOCTOR.

435
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,895
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN, WITNEY.

436
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:04,962
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

437
00:21:04,962 --> 00:21:06,529
BYE BYE, WITNEY.

438
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:08,095
UH, WAIT.

439
00:21:08,095 --> 00:21:09,829
WAIT A MINUTE, UNCLE!

440
00:21:09,829 --> 00:21:10,862
DON'T GO!

442
00:21:12,162 --> 00:21:13,562
UHHUH.

444
00:21:17,995 --> 00:21:19,962
HUH?

445
00:21:23,262 --> 00:21:25,829
HMM.

446
00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:26,762
ARRGH!

447
00:21:26,762 --> 00:21:29,495
I'LL TAKE MY BOUNTY
RIGHT HERE AND NOW.

448
00:21:29,495 --> 00:21:34,162
AH, THAT'S BETTER.

449
00:21:34,162 --> 00:21:35,362
AND GOOD RIDDANCE.

450
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:39,962
WHAT A FITTING PAYBACK FOR
ALL THE SLEAZY LIES YOU TOLD ME.

451
00:21:39,962 --> 00:21:43,595
WELL, THERE IS ONE
PART THAT'S TRUE...

452
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:47,495
THAT I FELL IN LOVE WITH
YOU WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING.

453
00:21:47,495 --> 00:21:52,862
I FELL IN LOVE
WITH SLEEPING BEAUTY.

454
00:21:52,862 --> 00:21:53,995
UH, NO! I'M LYING!

455
00:21:53,995 --> 00:21:56,195
IT'S JUST ANOTHER LIE!
YOU KNOW.

456
00:21:56,195 --> 00:21:58,962
HMM.

457
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:05,229
LOOK WHO'S HERE.
YOU MUST REALLY WANT ME BACK.

458
00:22:05,229 --> 00:22:06,529
YEAH. NICE TRY.

459
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:08,662
YOU WERE JEALOUS.

460
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:11,129
IN YOUR DREAMS.

461
00:22:12,795 --> 00:22:13,629
I'M STILL IN THE DARK.

462
00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:16,095
I MAY NEVER KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT MY PAST.

463
00:22:16,095 --> 00:22:17,995
DOESN'T REALLY
MATTER, DOES IT?

464
00:22:17,995 --> 00:22:19,095
EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

465
00:22:19,095 --> 00:22:21,029
AT LEAST YOU HAVE A PAST.

466
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:22,862
AND YOU HAVE A FUTURE.

467
00:22:22,862 --> 00:22:24,162
THAT'S WHAT COUNTS.

468
00:22:24,162 --> 00:22:25,295
WHAT'S THIS?

469
00:22:25,295 --> 00:22:30,795
IT'S YOUR SHARE OF THE BOUNTY
THE BIG 19,800 REWARD.

470
00:22:30,795 --> 00:22:31,529
YOU'RE KIDDING.

471
00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:35,195
THE SMALLEST OF
THE SMALL FRIES.

472
00:22:35,195 --> 00:22:38,995
SO IT WASN'T 19,800.

473
00:22:38,995 --> 00:22:42,729
I KIND OF PUT
AN EXTRA ZERO IN THERE.

474
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:44,495
HA HA.

475
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:33,962
SO I HAVE TO ADMIT, THE NEXT
EPISODE OF "COWBOY BEBOP" IS,

476
00:24:33,962 --> 00:24:36,695
WELL... IT'S KIND OF DEPRESSING.

477
00:24:36,695 --> 00:24:37,962
VERY DEPRESSING, ACTUALLY.

478
00:24:37,962 --> 00:24:40,762
THE ONLY CHARACTERS WHO SHOW UP
ARE A BUNCH OF MUSTY OLD GUYS.

479
00:24:40,762 --> 00:24:44,629
I HATE TO SAY THIS,
BUT IT'S KIND OF HEAVY-HANDED.

480
00:24:44,629 --> 00:24:45,962
CHILDREN SHOULDN'T WATCH IT.

481
00:24:45,962 --> 00:24:46,795
LADIES SHOULD AVOID IT, TOO.

482
00:24:46,795 --> 00:24:48,629
AND ON TOP OF THAT,

483
00:24:48,629 --> 00:24:50,629
IT'S BETTER IF YOU YOUNG
GUYS DON'T TUNE IN, EITHER.

484
00:24:50,629 --> 00:24:52,895
NEXT EPISODE
BLACK DOG SERENADE.

485
00:24:52,895 --> 00:24:55,629
OH, ALL YOU OLD GUYS, I WOULDN'T
MISS THIS ONE IF I WERE YOU.
