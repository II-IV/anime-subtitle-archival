00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,097
TELL HIM I'LL BE
WAITING FOR HIM THERE.

180
00:14:23,097 --> 00:14:26,330
THAT'S ALL.
HE'LL KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

181
00:14:28,197 --> 00:14:30,564
TELL HIM THAT
I'LL KEEP WAITING.

182
00:14:30,564 --> 00:14:32,530
BUT WHY?

183
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:36,497
SEE YOU LATER, FAYE VALENTINE.

184
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,497
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE!

185
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,397
HOW DO YOU KNOW I KNOW SPIKE?

186
00:15:11,564 --> 00:15:14,297
ARE YOU STILL IN PAIN?

187
00:15:14,297 --> 00:15:18,230
HAVE YOU HEARD THIS STORY?

188
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,097
HUH?

189
00:15:19,097 --> 00:15:22,130
A MAN INJURES
HIS LEG DURING A HUNT.

190
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,430
HE'S IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE SAVANNA.

191
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,797
NO MEANS TO TREAT THE WOUND.

192
00:15:26,797 --> 00:15:29,797
THE LEG ROTS
AND DEATH APPROACHES.

193
00:15:29,797 --> 00:15:32,564
LAST MINUTE HE'S
PICKED UP BY AN AIRPLANE.

194
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:37,930
HE LOOKS DOWN AND SEES
A LAND OF PURE WHITE BELOW HIM,

195
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,930
GLISTENING IN THE LIGHT.

196
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,530
IT'S THE SUMMIT OF
A SNOWCAPPED MOUNTAIN.

197
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,430
THE MOUNTAIN IS KILIMANJARO.

198
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:48,497
AS HE GAZES DOWN, HE FEELS
THE LIFE FLOWING OUT OF HIM,

199
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:53,097
AND HE THINKS,
"THAT'S WHERE I WAS HEADED."

200
00:15:53,097 --> 00:15:55,530
AND?

201
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:58,030
I HATE STORIES LIKE THAT.

202
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,297
MEN ONLY THINK ABOUT THE PAST
RIGHT BEFORE THEIR DEATH,

203
00:16:01,297 --> 00:16:02,964
AS IF THEY WERE
SEARCHING FRANTICALLY

204
00:16:02,964 --> 00:16:06,497
FOR PROOF THAT THEY WERE ALIVE.

205
00:16:10,364 --> 00:16:12,230

206
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:17,197
WHEN YOU AND I FIRST MET,
YOU TOLD ME SOMETHING.

207
00:16:17,197 --> 00:16:19,797
YOU SAID THAT
YOU HAD DIED ONCE.

208
00:16:19,797 --> 00:16:21,164
THAT YOU HAD SEEN DEATH.

209
00:16:21,164 --> 00:16:23,497
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST LET IT GO?

210
00:16:23,497 --> 00:16:26,064
FORGET THE PAST.

211
00:16:26,964 --> 00:16:28,230
THERE WAS A WOMAN.

212
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,464
FIRST TIME I FOUND SOMEONE
THAT WAS TRULY ALIVE.

213
00:16:31,464 --> 00:16:34,230
AT LEAST,
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

214
00:16:36,564 --> 00:16:40,797
SHE WAS THE PART OF ME I'D
LOST SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY...

215
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:43,097
THE PART THAT WAS MISSING...

216
00:16:43,097 --> 00:16:45,764
THAT I'D BEEN LONGING FOR.

217
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,797

SEE SPIKE, THAT'S FOR SURE.

A COUP ATTEMPT TWO DAYS AGO.

AND NOW THEY'RE HUNTING DOWN

CONNECTED TO THE COUP.
