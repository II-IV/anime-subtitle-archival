00:11:32,603 --> 00:11:34,636
I AM THE CENTRAL
PROCESSING UNIT

176
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:39,736
ON THE D135
ARTIFICIAL SATELLITE.

177
00:11:39,736 --> 00:11:43,336
TOO STUFFY.
DON'T YOU HAVE A NICKNAME?

178
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:45,636
THEN ED WILL GIVE YOU
ONE RIGHT NOW.

179
00:11:45,636 --> 00:11:47,636
UM, LET'S SEE.

180
00:11:47,636 --> 00:11:52,069
I KNOW! WHAT IF
I CALL YOU MPU?

181
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,736
WHY?

182
00:11:52,736 --> 00:11:55,936
IT'S LIKE CPU, ONLY NEATER.

183
00:11:55,936 --> 00:11:57,069
HA.

184
00:11:57,069 --> 00:12:01,003
"ED" IS SHORT FOR EDWARD WONG
HAU PEPELU TIVRUSKY IV.

185
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:02,769
ED MADE IT UP, YOU KNOW.

186
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:05,469
NICE TO MEET YOU.

187
00:12:05,469 --> 00:12:08,736
HERE. A SOUVENIR FROM EARTH.

188
00:12:08,736 --> 00:12:10,903
YOU SUPPOSED
TO EAT THIS THING?

189
00:12:10,903 --> 00:12:13,769
WHO KNOWS?
THOSE EARTHLINGS ARE WEIRD.

190
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:15,669
YEAH. THAT MAY BE,

191
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:17,703
BUT AT LEAST I GOT SOME
INFORMATION OUT OF THEM.

192
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,103
OUR PRIME TARGET
IS A HACKER

193
00:12:20,103 --> 00:12:22,503
NAMED RADICAL EDWARD,
A VERY HEAVY HITTER.

194
00:12:22,503 --> 00:12:26,103
GREAT, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
A PROFILE ON THIS GUY.

195
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:29,069
YES, I DO... SORT OF.

196
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:30,503
WELL, AT LEAST EIN LIKES THEM.

197
00:12:30,503 --> 00:12:33,103
I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT THESE THINGS ARE.

198
00:12:33,103 --> 00:12:33,669
HEY!

199
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,936
RADICAL EDWARD'S PROFILE

200
00:12:34,936 --> 00:12:42,303
HE'S A 7-FOOT-TALL EX-BASKETBALL
PRO-HINDU GURU DRAG QUEEN ALIEN.

201
00:12:44,103 --> 00:12:47,536
SO WHY'D YOU MAKE
THOSE BIG DOODLES?

202
00:12:47,536 --> 00:12:50,969
LONG, LONG AGO,
LONG BEFORE THE GATE DISASTER,

203
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:53,103
EARTH WAS A BEAUTIFUL PLANET

204
00:12:53,103 --> 00:12:55,636
WHERE PEOPLE LIVED IN
THE HILLS AND VALLEYS

205
00:12:55,636 --> 00:12:57,969
AND BY THE RIVERS,
LAKES, AND SEAS.

206
00:12:57,969 --> 00:13:01,436
BACK THEN, THERE WERE MANY
ANCIENT CARVINGS LIKE THIS.

207
00:13:01,436 --> 00:13:04,536
I USED TO LOOK DOWN AT THEM
AND WONDER ABOUT THEIR MEANING,

208
00:13:04,536 --> 00:13:06,403
WHICH SEEMED TO CHANGE
EACH TIME I SAW THEM.

209
00:13:06,403 --> 00:13:09,103
SO TO REMEMBER THOSE TIMES,

210
00:13:09,103 --> 00:13:11,603
I TRIED TO CREATE THE CARVINGS
THE WAY THEY USED TO BE.

211
00:13:11,603 --> 00:13:14,503
OH, YOU MEAN THERE USED
TO BE MORE BIG DOODLES.

212
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:16,569
YOU WERE JUST SAD
BECAUSE YOU MISSED THEM.

213
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:21,469
YES. I RECREATED THEM
WITH A 2% MARGIN OF ERROR.

214
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:23,336
MPU IS GOOD AT DRAWING.

215
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,603
HEY, CAN ED DRAW SOMETHING, TOO?

216
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:26,703
[GASPS]

217
00:13:26,703 --> 00:13:28,003
WHAT'S WRONG?

218
00:13:28,003 --> 00:13:32,503
THIS IS-- THE POLICE
ARE JAMMING MY SIGNAL.

219
00:13:32,503 --> 00:13:36,403
WHAT? HEY, MPU. HEY!

220
00:13:36,403 --> 00:13:38,569
WELL, WELL.
SCORE ONE FOR THE COPS.

221
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:41,736
WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES
TRACKING RADICAL EDWARD.

222
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:44,069
HMM?

223
00:13:46,469 --> 00:13:49,369
HEY, GUYS.
FOUND YOUR BOUNTYHEAD.

224
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:51,669
WHAT THE HUH--?

225
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:52,703
BEBOP.
[BARKS]

226
00:13:52,703 --> 00:13:55,369
GUESS WHAT. NOBODY HACKED
INTO THAT SATELLITE.

227
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:57,103
THE DATA PROVES
THERE'S NO BREAKIN.

228
00:13:57,103 --> 00:14:00,636
UH, SINCE WHEN DO WE
HAVE AN INTERACTIVE CHANNEL?

229
00:14:00,636 --> 00:14:01,503
WE DON'T.

230
00:14:01,503 --> 00:14:03,736
THIS IS A HACK JOB
DONE IN REAL TIME.

231
00:14:03,736 --> 00:14:04,669
WHO IS THIS KID?

232
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:07,603
WE'LL SEND YOU MPU's
DATA SO YOU CAN SEE.

233
00:14:07,603 --> 00:14:09,669
WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT'S MPU?

234
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:10,936
A FRIEND OF EDWARD'S.

235
00:14:10,936 --> 00:14:13,636
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
THAT YOU KNOW EDWARD?

236
00:14:13,636 --> 00:14:16,869
MMHMM,
BECAUSE EDWARD IS EDWARD.

237
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:18,069
HUH?

238
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:20,669
THERE'S NO TIME FOR GAMES.
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT SATELLITE?

239
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:24,703
UM, WELL, I COULD
JUST TELL YOU, I SUPPOSE,

240
00:14:24,703 --> 00:14:27,336
BUT THEN I'D WANT
A FAVOR IN RETURN.

241
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:28,203
A FAVOR?

242
00:14:28,203 --> 00:14:30,436
UH, YEAH. WE CAN
TALK ABOUT THAT LATER.

243
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,769
NOW CUT TO THE CHASE.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

244
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:33,903
[BARKS]

245
00:14:33,903 --> 00:14:35,903
SO THE CPU ON
AN ABANDONED SATELLITE

246
00:14:35,903 --> 00:14:39,669
JUST DECIDES TO DO SOME
LASER CARVINGS ALL ON ITS OWN.

247
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:42,436
OH, YEAH?
THAT'S BIZARRE.

248
00:14:42,436 --> 00:14:43,403
IT GETS MORE BIZARRE.

249
00:14:43,403 --> 00:14:45,769
THIS IS A WEATHER SATELLITE,

250
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:47,469
SO NO ONE HAS EVEN
THOUGHT OF CHECKING IT.

251
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:51,036
THEN THE BOUNTY IS NOT ON A
PERSON. IT'S ON THAT SATELLITE.

252
00:14:51,036 --> 00:14:54,436
SINCE MPU's ACCESS CODES
CAN'T BE USED ANYMORE,

253
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:57,736
YOU'LL HAVE TO ACTUALLY
GO TO THE SATELLITE.

254
00:14:57,736 --> 00:14:58,736
AND DO WHAT?

255
00:14:58,736 --> 00:15:01,536
DESTROY THE TRANSMITTERS
IT USES TO COMMUNICATE

256
00:15:01,536 --> 00:15:03,403
WITH THE OTHER SATELLITES
IN THE NETWORK.

257
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,669
THEN CREATE A DIRECT LINK
AND DOWNLOAD MPU.

258
00:15:06,669 --> 00:15:07,803
EASY, HUH?

259
00:15:07,803 --> 00:15:08,903
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

260
00:15:08,903 --> 00:15:11,869
YOU CAN'T USE YOUR COMPUTERS
FOR FLYING OR SHOOTING.

261
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,536
WHAT'S THAT?
DO IT ALL MANUALLY?

262
00:15:14,536 --> 00:15:16,003
IF YOU DON'T,
ALL THE ATTACK SATELLITES

263
00:15:16,003 --> 00:15:17,636
WILL PICK UP YOUR SIGNAL
AND OPEN FIRE.

264
00:15:17,636 --> 00:15:21,536
THERE'S ZILLIONS OF THEM,
AND THEY'VE ALL GOT KILL LASERS.

265
00:15:21,536 --> 00:15:23,069
WOW. IS THIS TOO HARD FOR YOU?

266
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:25,569
OH, NO. I WOULDN'T
CALL IT HARD.

267
00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:26,569
MORE LIKE IMPOSSIBLE.

268
00:15:26,569 --> 00:15:30,603
IT'S LIKE TRYING TO PLAY
BASEBALL WITHOUT A BAT.

269
00:15:30,603 --> 00:15:32,103
HEY, WHERE YOU GOING?

270
00:15:32,103 --> 00:15:34,836
NOW, THIS IS THE KIND
OF STUFF I LIKE.

271
00:15:34,836 --> 00:15:36,636
LET'S DO IT.

272
00:15:41,936 --> 00:15:43,636
WAIT A MINUTE.

273
00:15:43,636 --> 00:15:45,703
HOW DO YOU KNOW
SO MUCH ABOUT US?

274
00:15:45,703 --> 00:15:46,703
EDWARD KNOWS EVERYTHING.

275
00:15:46,703 --> 00:15:48,603
LAST WEEK, YOU WERE ON MARS

276
00:15:48,603 --> 00:15:50,969
CHASING A BOUNTYHEAD
NAMED AJIZ WHO GOT AWAY.

277
00:15:50,969 --> 00:15:52,736
SO MUCH FOR
THE ONE-MILLION REWARD.

278
00:15:52,736 --> 00:15:55,103
BEFORE THAT, ON PYORTLE,

279
00:15:55,103 --> 00:15:56,636
THE POLICE BEAT
YOU TO YOUR BOUNTY.

280
00:15:56,636 --> 00:15:57,769
OH, JEEZ.

281
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:00,469
YOU REALLY ARE RADICAL EDWARD,
THE ONE THEY TALK ABOUT.

282
00:16:00,469 --> 00:16:03,703
UHHUH. WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD?

283
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:08,336
CONNECT D7 TO NUMBER 2.

284
00:16:08,336 --> 00:16:11,603
THAT WAY YOU CAN FIRE
THE LASERS WITHOUT THE COMPUTER.

285
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,469
I'M TRUSTING YOU ON THIS.

286
00:16:13,469 --> 00:16:14,369
LISTEN.

287
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:16,503
DON'T USE MISSILES
UNLESS YOU HAVE TO.

288
00:16:16,503 --> 00:16:17,603
THEY'RE EXPENSIVE.

289
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:18,803
YEAH, RIGHT.

290
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:20,769
1,200 TO TARGET.

291
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:23,636
ALL RIGHT. PREPARE
TO SHUT DOWN YOUR COMPUTER.

292
00:16:23,636 --> 00:16:25,769
YOU'LL ONLY HAVE ONE CHANCE.

293
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:27,603
THAT'S ALL I'M GONNA NEED.

294
00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:33,669
AND YOU CAN GIVE US
THE DATA TO PROVE THIS

295
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:36,603
THAT THAT SATELLITE WAS
ACTING ALL ON ITS OWN?

296
00:16:36,603 --> 00:16:38,803
IT'S THE BOUNTYHEAD?
THERE'S NO HACKER?

297
00:16:38,803 --> 00:16:40,703
ED CAN PROVE IT, NO PROBLEM,

298
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,003
BUT REMEMBER,
ED WANTS A FAVOR IN RETURN.

299
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:45,669
IF YOU DO IT, ED WON'T
TAKE ANY OF THE REWARD.

300
00:16:45,669 --> 00:16:48,844
OH, WELL, NOW,
AREN'T YOU A NICE KID?

301
00:16:57,906 --> 00:16:59,186
THAT'S THE ONE.

302
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:01,186
HMM.

303
00:17:12,486 --> 00:17:15,686
SOMEONE.

304
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,752
YOU HIT IT? DID YOU?

305
00:17:29,752 --> 00:17:30,719
NO. IT SAW ME COMING.

306
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:34,286
AN ATTACK SATELLITE
BLOCKED MY LASER BLAST.

307
00:17:39,086 --> 00:17:42,786
THEN WE HAVE TO TAKE OUT ALL
THE SATELLITES IN THE SECTOR.

308
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:44,019
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.

309
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:47,152
IF WE DON'T,
THEY'LL TAKE US OUT.

310
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:52,952
THESE MISSILES
ARE CURVING OFF TARGET.

311
00:17:52,952 --> 00:17:56,052
OH, THE CHEAP ONES
ARE WORTHLESS.

312
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:08,486
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.

313
00:18:08,486 --> 00:18:09,319
HUH?

314
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:11,286
JET, APPROACH
TO 20 METERS OF MPU

315
00:18:11,286 --> 00:18:15,152
THE ATTACK SATELLITES WON'T
FIRE WHEN YOU'RE THAT CLOSE.

316
00:18:15,152 --> 00:18:15,986
THEN WHAT?

317
00:18:15,986 --> 00:18:17,786
HAVE FAYE ACT
AS A DECOY TO COVER.

318
00:18:17,786 --> 00:18:20,919
WHY ME? THANKS, FAYE.

319
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:36,152
ALL RIGHT.

320
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:54,186
HURRY UP!
THEY'RE ALL CLOSING IN!

321
00:18:55,986 --> 00:18:58,419
SHE'S ALL YOURS.

322
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:01,186
MPU.

323
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,186
MPU. MPU.

324
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:09,119
OH, ED. ED. WE MEET AGAIN.

325
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,219
MPU, THEY HAVE
A BOUNTY OUT ON YOU.

326
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:13,152
BOUNTY?

327
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,152
YES, BUT WE'LL JUST
MAKE A COPY OF YOU.

328
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:19,019
THEN WE'LL LET THEM CATCH
THE COPY, AND YOU'LL BE SAFE.

329
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:19,819
SAFE.

330
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:21,886
YOU MUST BE LONELY
OUT THERE, MPU.

331
00:19:21,886 --> 00:19:22,886
IF YOU LET US DOWNLOAD YOU,

332
00:19:22,886 --> 00:19:26,186
YOU'LL BE WITH US,
AND WE'LL BE YOUR FRIENDS.

333
00:19:26,186 --> 00:19:26,852
FRIENDS.

334
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:30,819
UHHUH. IT'S NOT SCARY HERE.

335
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:38,119
AHH.

336
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:41,086
AND SO, WE HAVE
A STRANGE ENDING

337
00:19:41,086 --> 00:19:42,219
TO A STRANGE CASE.

338
00:19:42,219 --> 00:19:43,986
THE CRIMINAL
WAS APPREHENDED.

339
00:19:43,986 --> 00:19:46,019
IT TURNED OUT TO
BE A SPY SATELLITE

340
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,219
DISGUISED AS
A WEATHER SATELLITE.

341
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,486
LAUNCHED BEFORE
THE GATE CATASTROPHE

342
00:19:49,486 --> 00:19:50,552
THAT WRECKED
THE EARTH'S SURFACE,

343
00:19:50,552 --> 00:19:51,586
ACCORDING TO ARCHIVES
RECOVERED FROM THE PERIOD,

344
00:19:51,586 --> 00:19:55,152
THE SATELLITE WAS
PROGRAMMED TO SELF-ACTIVATE

345
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,319
IN THE ABSENCE OF
