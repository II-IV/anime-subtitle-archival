OF THIS OPERATION.

348
00:21:20,672 --> 00:21:26,286
MEIFA IS HERE NOW BECAUSE
BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO FIND YOU.

349
00:21:27,205 --> 00:21:30,739
HUH. YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.

350
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:35,272
PERHAPS I GAVE MYSELF
TOO MUCH CREDIT.

351
00:21:37,205 --> 00:21:42,647
MEIFA, IT'S SO WONDERFUL
TO SEE YOU ONE LAST TIME.

352
00:21:43,405 --> 00:21:47,739
I HATED YOU.
I HATED YOU FOR ALL THOSE YEARS.

353
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:53,139
IT'S TRUE.
IT HURT SO MUCH.

354
00:21:56,139 --> 00:21:59,205
BUT NOW I DON'T.

355
00:22:08,139 --> 00:22:10,072
DADDY.

356
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:24,705
NOW, I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS
A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING

357
00:22:24,705 --> 00:22:26,572
THAT WE BROUGHT HER OUT THERE,

358
00:22:26,572 --> 00:22:30,739
BUT THAT WAS HOW
THIS PECULIAR CASE ENDED.

359
00:22:30,739 --> 00:22:33,372
MEIFA WENT BACK HOME TO MARS,

360
00:22:33,372 --> 00:22:36,972
OUR NO SMOKING AREA
BECAME A SMOKING ZONE AGAIN,

361
00:22:36,972 --> 00:22:42,039
AND LIFE RETURNED TO THE SAME
DAILY ROUTINE, JUST LIKE BEFORE.

362
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:44,239
ONE THING HAS CHANGED, THOUGH.

363
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:45,439
WHEN I READ THE NEWS,

364
00:22:45,439 --> 00:22:47,472
I NEVER CHECK
THE HOROSCOPES ANYMORE.

365
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:31,972
HE CAME WITH A WHISTLE.

366
00:24:37,772 --> 00:24:41,605
AND HE APPEARED OUT OF
THE BLUE ON HORSEBACK.

367
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,672
WHO IS HE?

368
00:24:43,672 --> 00:24:46,705
FRIEND OR FOE, OR JUST
AN OLDFASHIONED COWPOKE?

369
00:24:46,705 --> 00:24:49,539
THE NEXT EPISODE
IS A SHOCKING SCIFI

370
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:51,605
SPAGHETTI-WESTERN EPIC SAGA.

371
00:24:51,605 --> 00:24:53,205
"COWBOY FUNK."

372
00:24:53,205 --> 00:24:56,405
HEY, ARE WE TAKING THIS
COWBOY THING A LITTLE TOO FAR?
