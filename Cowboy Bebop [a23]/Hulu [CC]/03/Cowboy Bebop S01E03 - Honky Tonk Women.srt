NOT THE POKER CHIP, DUMMY.

182
00:13:58,418 --> 00:14:00,751
THERE'S ANOTHER CHIP
INSIDE THAT CHIP

183
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:01,885
A MICROCHIP.

184
00:14:01,885 --> 00:14:04,351
HMM? HMM.

185
00:14:10,885 --> 00:14:11,651
HI, AMIGOS!

186
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,685
YOU READY FOR
SOME BOUNTY INFO?

187
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:17,351
"BIG SHOT," COWBOYS,

188
00:14:24,351 --> 00:14:25,185
WHOA!

189
00:14:25,185 --> 00:14:26,851
SO, COACH,
WHO'S UP FIRST THIS WEEK?

190
00:14:26,851 --> 00:14:29,785
A PRETTY POKER PLAYER
THAT'S HEADED FOR THE POKEY.

191
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:30,851
YO! HEY, SPIKE!

192
00:14:30,851 --> 00:14:33,518
SHE'S A TOUGH COOKIE
FAYE VALENTINE.

193
00:14:33,518 --> 00:14:34,585
MMM!

194
00:14:34,585 --> 00:14:36,851
AND THE BOUNTY'S A WHOPPING
6 MILLION WOOLONGS.

195
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:37,818
YO. HEY, JET.

196
00:14:37,818 --> 00:14:38,551
SHUCKS, HOWDY!

197
00:14:38,551 --> 00:14:40,985
HAPPY HUNTING,
ALL YOU COWBOYS.

198
00:14:42,351 --> 00:14:43,851
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

199
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:46,051
FIRST OFF,
I DIDN'T RUN AWAY.

200
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,485
MY SHIP WAS HIJACKED.

201
00:14:47,485 --> 00:14:49,718
I BELIEVE YOU, OF COURSE.

202
00:14:49,718 --> 00:14:50,818
WHERE ARE YOU?

203
00:14:50,818 --> 00:14:52,551
AN OLD FISHING SHIP
AT THE GATE.

204
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:55,418
AND THEY HAVE
THE CONTROL CHIP, GORDON,

205
00:14:55,418 --> 00:14:58,351
SO HURRY UP AND... HUH?

206
00:15:04,518 --> 00:15:05,318
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

207
00:15:05,318 --> 00:15:07,085
WELL, WE WERE
THINKING ABOUT YOU,

208
00:15:07,085 --> 00:15:09,085
AND WE HAD
A LITTLE CHANGE OF HEART.

209
00:15:09,085 --> 00:15:11,551
WHY LOCK A FINE
YOUNG LADY LIKE YOU

210
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:12,585
UP IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?

211
00:15:12,585 --> 00:15:15,951
YOU CREEPS AREN'T
GETTING ANY IDEAS, ARE YOU?

212
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:17,351
ON THE CONTRARY.

213
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:18,185
WE'RE TAKING YOU SOMEPLACE

214
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:20,018
WHERE YOU'LL BE
VERY WELL PROTECTED.

215
00:15:20,018 --> 00:15:21,918
OH, AND WHERE
WOULD THAT BE?

216
00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:23,651
THE POLICE STATION.

217
00:15:23,651 --> 00:15:24,918
YOU WERE RIGHT.

218
00:15:24,918 --> 00:15:28,718
200K IS CHUMP CHANGE COMPARED
TO YOUR PRICE, FAYE VALENTINE.

219
00:15:28,718 --> 00:15:29,785
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

220
00:15:29,785 --> 00:15:31,385
DID THEY PUT A BOUNTY ON ME?

221
00:15:31,385 --> 00:15:33,751
6 MILLION FAT WOOLONGS.

222
00:15:33,751 --> 00:15:34,885
6 MILLION?

223
00:15:34,885 --> 00:15:36,851
IS THAT ALL
THEY'RE OFFERING?

224
00:15:36,851 --> 00:15:39,785
JUST HOW MUCH MONEY
DO YOU OWE, ANYWAY?

225
00:15:39,785 --> 00:15:40,718
COME ON.

226
00:15:40,718 --> 00:15:41,418
HAVE A HEART.

227
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:42,485
TAKE ME ANYWHERE BUT THE POLICE.

228
00:15:42,485 --> 00:15:44,885
THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES
WHO WILL PAY YOUR BOUNTY.

229
00:15:44,885 --> 00:15:47,351
I CAN'T BE STUCK
IN ONE PLACE FOR LONG.

230
00:15:47,351 --> 00:15:48,018
IT WILL KILL ME.

231
00:15:48,018 --> 00:15:49,885
MY WHOLE FAMILY'S LIKE THAT.

232
00:15:49,885 --> 00:15:50,785
YEAH, RIGHT.

233
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:51,885
WE'RE ROMANIES.

234
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:54,551
FOR EONS, WE'VE WANDERED
THE STARS, LOOKING FOR LOVE.

235
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:55,818
IT'S OUR WAY.

236
00:15:55,818 --> 00:15:56,618
HUH?

237
00:15:56,618 --> 00:15:58,051
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING, DO YOU?

238
00:15:58,051 --> 00:15:59,051
ROMANIES ARE GYPSIES.

239
00:15:59,051 --> 00:16:01,785
AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE CALL
SOMEONE LIKE YOU?

240
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:02,918
A GAUJO.

241
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:04,585
THAT MEANS A BUMPKIN WHO
DOESN'T KNOW WHICH WAY IS UP.

242
00:16:04,585 --> 00:16:06,651
GAUJO. I LIKE THAT.

243
00:16:06,651 --> 00:16:07,285
[HOWLS]

244
00:16:07,285 --> 00:16:08,485
THE WILDS ARE CALLING ME!

245
00:16:08,485 --> 00:16:09,818
YOU CAN'T KEEP ME LOCKED UP!

246
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:11,751
SAVE IT FOR THE POLICE.

247
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:13,918
COME ON, JET.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

248
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:14,618
OH, FINE!

249
00:16:14,618 --> 00:16:15,851
LOOK, I'M NOT GOING TO RUN AWAY!

250
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:17,518
AT LEAST UNCUFF ONE HAND.

251
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,885
I CAN'T EVEN GO
TO THE BATHROOM THIS WAY!

252
00:16:19,885 --> 00:16:23,818
MAN, YOU'RE
A REAL TALKER, AREN'T YOU?

253
00:16:28,418 --> 00:16:31,018
SPIKE, MY FRIEND,
THAT GIRL IS MONEY IN THE BANK.

254
00:16:31,018 --> 00:16:33,818
YEAH. NO PENALTY
FOR EARLY WITHDRAWAL.

255
00:16:33,818 --> 00:16:35,985
IT'S JUST LIKE
CHARLIE SAID IN MY DREAM.

256
00:16:35,985 --> 00:16:38,751
IF YOU WANT TO RECEIVE,
YOU HAVE TO GIVE.

257
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:39,551
SEE, SPIKE?

258
00:16:39,551 --> 00:16:40,418
YOU GOT TO LISTEN
TO YOUR DREAMS.

259
00:16:40,418 --> 00:16:42,951
THAT'S HOW YOU'LL FIND
YOUR DREAM GIRL.

260
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:44,018
[CRASH]

261
00:16:44,018 --> 00:16:45,851
HEY!

262
00:16:45,851 --> 00:16:47,518
OW!

263
00:16:51,418 --> 00:16:53,885
WHO'S THAT?

264
00:16:53,885 --> 00:16:57,051
I'M NOT SURE WHO YOU ARE,
AND I DON'T REALLY GIVE A DAMN.

265
00:16:57,051 --> 00:16:59,818
YOU HAVE MY CHIP,
AND I WANT IT BACK.

266
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,418
WELL, I'M NOT
SURE WHO YOU ARE,

267
00:17:01,418 --> 00:17:02,851
AND I'M NOT GIVING
YOU ANYTHING.

268
00:17:02,851 --> 00:17:03,851
ARE WE DONE NOW?

269
00:17:03,851 --> 00:17:05,718
IT'S JUST A POKER CHIP.

270
00:17:05,718 --> 00:17:07,451
IT HAS NO VALUE TO YOU.

271
00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:08,951
OH, WE'VE BECOME
QUITE FOND OF IT,

272
00:17:08,951 --> 00:17:10,851
AND WE KNOW WHAT IT'S WORTH.

273
00:17:10,851 --> 00:17:14,918
3 YEARS AGO, S.I.T. DEVELOPED
A MASTER DECRYPTION PROGRAM

274
00:17:14,918 --> 00:17:15,985
CALLED CRYPTBREAKER.

275
00:17:15,985 --> 00:17:18,385
RUMOR HAS IT THAT SHORTLY
AFTER ITS COMPLETION,

276
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:21,885
THE PROGRAMMER TURNED UP DEAD
AND THE PROGRAM DISAPPEARED

277
00:17:21,885 --> 00:17:24,785
A PROGRAM WITH ADVANCED
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

278
00:17:24,785 --> 00:17:28,051
IT CAN DECRYPT AND UNLOCK
VIRTUALLY ANY SECURITY CODE.

279
00:17:28,051 --> 00:17:31,485
BUT THE CATCH IS,
THE PROGRAM ITSELF IS ENCODED.

280
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:34,351
SO WHOEVER HAS IT
NEEDS THE KEY TO OPEN IT

281
00:17:34,351 --> 00:17:36,018
THE KEY TO THE KEY,
SO TO SPEAK.

282
00:17:36,018 --> 00:17:38,918
THEY SAY THE COPS
AND THE I.S.S.P. SPECIAL FORCES

283
00:17:38,918 --> 00:17:41,785
HAVE BEEN SEARCHING EVERY
CORNER OF THE ASTEROIDS FOR IT.

284
00:17:41,785 --> 00:17:44,351
GUESS THEY NEVER THOUGHT
TO LOOK IN A CASINO.

285
00:17:44,351 --> 00:17:49,518
OR EVEN IF THEY DID, WHO'D EVER
SUSPECT A HUMBLE POKER CHIP?

286
00:17:49,518 --> 00:17:51,518
HMM. NOT BAD.

287
00:17:51,518 --> 00:17:52,585
YOU'VE DONE YOUR HOMEWORK.

288
00:17:52,585 --> 00:17:55,918
I USED TO BE WITH I.S.S.P.
SPECIAL FORCES MYSELF,

289
00:17:55,918 --> 00:17:57,418
IN ANOTHER LIFETIME.

290
00:17:57,418 --> 00:17:59,418
OF COURSE, A CASINO
IS A PERFECT PLACE

291
00:17:59,418 --> 00:18:01,718
TO LAUNDER LARGE SUMS
OF STOLEN MONEY.

292
00:18:01,718 --> 00:18:03,451
YOU HAD THE RIGHT IDEA.

293
00:18:03,451 --> 00:18:05,085
YOU JUST CHOSE THE WRONG DAY.

294
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:07,818
NOW, IT'S ONLY RIGHT
THAT WE DO OUR CIVIC DUTY

295
00:18:07,818 --> 00:18:08,885
AND GIVE IT TO THE POLICE,

296
00:18:08,885 --> 00:18:11,885
SINCE, AS YOU POINTED OUT,
IT'S WORTHLESS TO US.

297
00:18:11,885 --> 00:18:14,918
IT'S NOT WORTHLESS
IF I PAY YOU FOR IT.

298
00:18:14,918 --> 00:18:16,518
300 MILLION WOOLONGS?

299

OK. 6 MILLION
TURNS INTO 30 MILLION.
