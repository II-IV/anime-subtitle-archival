00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,244
THAT'S PART OF LIFE,
TOO, ISN'T IT?

348
00:21:54,244 --> 00:21:55,244
YOU'RE NOT PERFECT,

349
00:21:55,244 --> 00:21:58,277
BUT YOU'VE GOT A LOT TO GIVE,
SO REMEMBER...

350
00:21:58,277 --> 00:22:02,010
I'LL ALWAYS BE CHEERING YOU ON.

351
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:05,844
AND NOW A BIG CHEER
FROM MY HEART.

352
00:22:07,277 --> 00:22:11,610
LET'S... GO... ME!

353
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:12,577
ALL RIGHT!

354
00:22:12,577 --> 00:22:16,144
DO YOUR BEST, DO YOUR BEST!
DON'T LOSE, ME!

355
00:22:16,144 --> 00:22:21,177
LET'S GO! DON'T LOSE!

00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,177
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

358
00:22:27,177 --> 00:22:32,144
DON'T YOU LOSE,
DON'T YOU LOSE, ME, ME, ME!

359
00:22:32,144 --> 00:22:35,244
GO, ME! YAY!

360
00:22:35,244 --> 00:22:36,077
HEE HEE HEE!

361
00:22:36,077 --> 00:22:40,244
IN YOUR TIME,
I'M NO LONGER HERE,

362
00:22:40,244 --> 00:22:41,877
BUT I AM HERE TODAY,

363

MY ONLY SELF.

00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,277
YOU KNOW, I'M STARTING
TO GET TIRED OF US

366
00:24:32,277 --> 00:24:33,244
DOING ALL THE PREVIEWS
LIKE THIS.

367
00:24:33,244 --> 00:24:35,944
ONCE IN A WHILE,
CAN'T WE HAVE SOMEONE ELSE?

368
00:24:35,944 --> 00:24:37,077

[HOWLING]

375
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,273
OH, SO THAT'S HOW IT IS. WOW.
