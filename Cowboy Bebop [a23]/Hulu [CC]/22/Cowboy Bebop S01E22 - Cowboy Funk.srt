354
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:13,074
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO NOW?

355
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:17,507
I HAVE NO DOUBT
I'LL FIND SOME NEW CAREER.

356
00:21:18,374 --> 00:21:20,807
SEE YOU, SPACE COWBOY.

357
00:21:20,807 --> 00:21:23,240
[HORSE NEIGHS]

358
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,940
IT WAS ONLY
A RICH BOY'S HOBBY.

359
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,874
HE WAS ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL,

360
00:21:35,874 --> 00:21:39,307
OR SHOULD I SAY,
OUT OF HIS LEAGUE WITH ME.

361
00:21:39,574 --> 00:21:42,174
HEY, ARE YOU LISTENING?
YEAH, YEAH.

362
00:21:42,174 --> 00:21:44,974
ANDY WASN'T MY ADVERSARY
AFTER ALL.

363
00:21:44,974 --> 00:21:46,107
OF COURSE I NEVER REALLY

364
00:21:46,107 --> 00:21:48,040
HAD ANYTHING PERSONAL
AGAINST THE GUY.

365
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,907
YOWWEE! YOW! YAHHOW! YAHOO!

366
00:21:51,907 --> 00:21:55,307
HEY, ARE YOU LISTENING?!
YEAH, YEAH.

367
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,407
WELL, ANYWAY.
WHAT WERE YOU TRYING TO ACHIEVE

368
00:21:59,407 --> 00:22:02,307
BY BLOWING EVERYTHING UP?

369
00:22:02,307 --> 00:22:04,974
I ONLY WANTED
TO SEND OUT A WARNING

370
00:22:04,974 --> 00:22:06,474
AGAINST THE NEEDLESS WASTE

371
00:22:06,474 --> 00:22:09,507
CREATED BY CAPITALISM
WITHOUT PHILOSOPHY,

372
00:22:09,507 --> 00:22:11,874
THE NEEDLESS COLONIZATION
OF PLANETS,

373
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:14,340
THE NEEDLESS CIRCULATION
OF SLANTED MEDIA,

374
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:18,074
AND NEEDLESSLY TALL BUILDINGS
THAT SYMBOLIZE ALL OF THIS!

375
00:22:18,074 --> 00:22:20,874
YOU SEE,
BY DESTROYING THESE MONOLITHS,

376
00:22:20,874 --> 00:22:22,274
I INTENDED TO REMIND THE WORLD

377
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:25,040
WHAT THE PIONEERING SPIRIT
IS TRULY ABOUT.

378
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,107
WAIT, WAIT! WAIT!!
HUH?

379
00:22:29,074 --> 00:22:30,007
ANDY.

380
00:22:30,007 --> 00:22:32,874
CALL ME MUSASHI! HA HA!

381
00:22:32,874 --> 00:22:35,874
GO, JINOMARU!

382
00:22:35,874 --> 00:22:37,074
[HORSE NEIGHS]

383
00:22:37,074 --> 00:22:42,474
BUT THEN, IT WAS ONLY THIS,
TOO, WASN'T IT?

384
00:24:31,207 --> 00:24:32,340
"COWBOY BEBOP."

385
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,985
SO, DID EVERYONE CATCH ME
IN ACTION THIS PAST EPISODE?

386
00:24:34,985 --> 00:24:36,645
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE!

387
00:24:36,645 --> 00:24:38,045
NOW ABOUT THE NEXT EPISODE...

388
00:24:38,045 --> 00:24:39,712
WHY ARE YOU DOING THE PREVIEW?

389
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:43,245
ONCE AGAIN, I, ANDY,
WILL BE THE MAN IN ACTION.

390
00:24:43,245 --> 00:24:44,112
YOU HAD YOUR TURN ALREADY.

391
00:24:44,112 --> 00:24:45,878
NOW THAT I HAVE
BECOME A SPACE SAMURAI,

392
00:24:45,878 --> 00:24:48,312
I WILL SLICE UP THE COWBOYS
ONE BY ONE!

393
00:24:48,312 --> 00:24:49,412
I SAID, YOU'RE
NOT COMING BACK.

394
00:24:49,412 --> 00:24:53,378
NEXT TIME, ON COWBOY BEBOP,
ANDY'S COUNTERATTACK.

395
00:24:53,378 --> 00:24:55,612
THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT TITLE!

396
00:24:55,612 --> 00:24:57,512
COWBOY BEBOP.
