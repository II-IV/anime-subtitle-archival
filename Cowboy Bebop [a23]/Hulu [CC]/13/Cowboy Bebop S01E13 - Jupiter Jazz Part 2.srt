WHAT DO YOU WANT?

181
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,075
WHEN YOU GAVE ME
THAT MUSIC BOX,

182
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:29,308
YOU DIDN'T THINK I'D EVER
BREAK IT OPEN AND LOOK INSIDE.

183
00:14:29,308 --> 00:14:30,741
WHY WOULD I?

184
00:14:30,741 --> 00:14:34,041
SO YOU FOUND
THE SOLAR TRANSMITTER.

185
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,008
JULIA FOUND IT.

186
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:37,341
THE MOMENT SHE HEARD
IT WAS A GIFT FROM YOU,

187
00:14:37,341 --> 00:14:39,941
SHE TOLD ME
TO OPEN IT UP AND LOOK.

188
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:42,275
AND WHAT ABOUT IT?

189
00:14:42,275 --> 00:14:46,141
ARE YOU TRYING TO
KILL ME AGAIN? IS THAT IT?

190
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:49,375
WE FOUGHT THAT
BLOODY WAR TOGETHER.

191
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,141
WE WERE COMRADES.

192
00:14:53,908 --> 00:14:55,375
YOU RISKED EVERYTHING

193
00:14:55,375 --> 00:15:00,408
SHOULDER TO SHOULDER
ON THAT BATTLEGROUND OF DEATH.

194
00:15:00,408 --> 00:15:03,308
I LOOKED UP TO YOU.

195
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:08,041
I BELIEVED IN YOU.

196
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,841
THERE WAS NOTHING
TO BELIEVE IN.

197
00:15:14,741 --> 00:15:18,175
THERE'S NO NEED TO BELIEVE.

198
00:15:19,741 --> 00:15:21,841
VICIOUS, LOOK OUT!

200
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:42,408
THERE IS NOTHING IN
THIS WORLD TO BELIEVE IN.

00:15:50,341 --> 00:15:51,875
VICIOUS!

202
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:56,141
LIN DIED PROTECTING YOU.

203
00:15:56,341 --> 00:15:57,241
SOUL IS LOST.

204
00:15:57,241 --> 00:16:00,308
HE WASN'T PROTECTING ME.
DON'T YOU GET IT?

205
00:16:00,308 --> 00:16:03,141
HE WAS PROTECTING THE ORDER.

206
00:16:22,108 --> 00:16:24,941

YOU'RE IN THE WAY.

00:18:04,342 --> 00:18:06,163
HEY, COME ON.
HEY!

212
00:18:06,163 --> 00:18:08,130
GREN, TELL ME WHERE JULIA IS.

213
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,943
I'VE GOTTA FIND HER.

214
00:18:11,943 --> 00:18:14,443
JULIA'S GONE.
HOW DID YOU KNOW HER?

215
00:18:14,443 --> 00:18:18,010
WHAT HAPPENED?
I NEED TO KNOW.

216
00:18:19,643 --> 00:18:22,476
[COUGHING]

217
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,943
YOU'VE GOT AN INTERNAL INJURY.

218
00:18:24,943 --> 00:18:26,843
I DON'T KNOW IF AN AMBULANCE

219
00:18:26,843 --> 00:18:29,038
WILL EVEN COME OUT
TO THIS PLACE.

220
00:18:33,043 --> 00:18:35,010
PUT IT AWAY.

221
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:38,110
CAN YOU LIFT ME UP THERE
ONTO THE SHIP AGAIN?

222
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,410
HUH?

223
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,710
I WANT TO GO TO TITAN.

224
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,676
YOU CAN'T MAKE IT THERE
IN THIS CONDITION.

225
00:18:43,676 --> 00:18:45,843
IT WOULD TAKE TOO LONG.

226
00:18:45,843 --> 00:18:47,976
I'M NOT GONNA MAKE IT ANYWAY.

227
00:18:47,976 --> 00:18:51,876
DYING ON MY WAY THERE
WOULD BE A GOOD WAY TO GO.

228
00:18:51,876 --> 00:18:55,610
I WANT TO GO BACK ONE LAST TIME.

229
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:56,976
IF I CAN'T DO THAT,

230
00:18:56,976 --> 00:19:00,943
THEN AT LEAST I'LL BE ON MY WAY.

231
00:19:00,943 --> 00:19:03,610
CAN YOU HELP ME TAKE OFF?

232
00:19:14,643 --> 00:19:17,676
I GET IT NOW.

233
00:19:17,676 --> 00:19:19,710
YOU'RE THE ONE, AREN'T YOU?
YOU'RE SPIKE.

234
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:23,810
JULIA WAS ALWAYS
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

235
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,643
YOUR EYES ARE DIFFERENT COLORS.

236
00:19:25,643 --> 00:19:28,876
I REMEMBER HER SAYING THAT.

237
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,510
SAID YOU GET A STRANGE FEELING

238
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,576
IF YOU KEEP LOOKING
STRAIGHT INTO HIS EYES.

239
00:19:34,576 --> 00:19:37,043
WHERE'D YOU MEET HER?
WHERE WAS SHE?

240
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,610
RIGHT ON THE CORNER BARSTOOL.

241
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,376
SHE SLIPPED IN
WHEN I WASN'T LOOKING.

242
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:43,943
SHE'D ASK ME TO PLAY
THE SAME SONG

243
00:19:43,943 --> 00:19:45,810
EVERY TIME SHE CAME IN.

244
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,710
STRANGE LILTING TUNE.

245
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:51,543
AND THEN SHE WOULD SMILE.

246
00:19:51,543 --> 00:19:53,710
OH, WHAT A SMILE.

247
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,576
SO SAD.

248
00:19:56,576 --> 00:20:00,676
SO BEAUTIFUL.

249
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,476
WHAT ARE YOU
BRINGING IN?

250
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,376
NOTHING.

251
00:21:11,376 --> 00:21:14,876
HURRY UP AND GET INSIDE.
WE'RE TAKING OFF.

252
00:21:25,476 --> 00:21:26,076
JULIA.

253
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,876
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

254
00:21:27,876 --> 00:21:28,810
HMM?

255
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,576
OH, NOTHING.
JUST THINKING ABOUT SOMEONE.

256
00:21:31,576 --> 00:21:33,943
WHERE'D YOU GUYS GO, ANYWAY?

257
00:21:33,943 --> 00:21:35,110
SOMEPLACE VERY GOOD.

258
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,876
HOW COME EDWARD GOT LEFT OUT?

259
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:41,076
OH, I'LL TELL YOU
ABOUT IT SOMEDAY.

260
00:21:41,076 --> 00:21:42,876
NAH.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

261
00:21:42,876 --> 00:21:46,943
OH, ED, ANYTHING BUT BLUE.

262
00:22:01,876 --> 00:22:04,110
A STAR JUST FELL FROM THE SKY.

263
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:07,543
THAT IS NOT AN ORDINARY STAR,
MY SON.

264
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:10,343
THAT STAR IS THE TEAR
OF A WARRIOR.

265
00:22:10,343 --> 00:22:11,276
WHAT WARRIOR IS IT?

266
00:22:11,276 --> 00:22:14,576
A LOST SOUL WHO HAS
FINISHED HIS BATTLE

267
00:22:14,576 --> 00:22:16,476
SOMEWHERE ON THIS PLANET.

268
00:22:16,476 --> 00:22:17,710
AHH.

269
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,443
A PITIFUL SOUL WHO COULD NOT
FIND HIS WAY TO THE LOFTY REALM

270
00:22:21,443 --> 00:22:24,343
WHERE THE GREAT SPIRIT
AWAITS US ALL.

271
00:24:30,043 --> 00:24:31,943
WHAT IS GOING ON
IN THIS WORLD?

272
00:24:31,943 --> 00:24:35,510
THOUGH YOU'RE ALIVE,
DARKNESS LOOMS ONLY INCHES AWAY.

273
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:39,876
A WORLD WHERE ANY MOVE YOU MAKE
COULD BE A DANGEROUS MISTAKE.

274
00:24:39,876 --> 00:24:42,110
SO WE WILL STEP AWAY
FROM THE MAINSTREAM

275
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:45,776
AND LIVE LIKE VAGABONDS
AND COMMON DROPOUTS.

276
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:48,910

FOR SOMEONE JUST LIKE YOU.

278
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,810
DON'T YOU WANT TO HANG OUT
AND WASTE YOUR LIFE WITH US?
