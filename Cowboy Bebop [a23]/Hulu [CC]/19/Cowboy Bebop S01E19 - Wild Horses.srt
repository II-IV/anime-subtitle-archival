174
00:11:07,328 --> 00:11:08,362
A BARGAIN, HUH?

175
00:11:08,362 --> 00:11:11,028
WELL, NOT WHEN THE SCRAPS
CAN BE TRACED BACK.

176
00:11:11,028 --> 00:11:11,828
SO, HOW'S THE DEALER?

177
00:11:11,828 --> 00:11:13,728
WHERE DID YOU
GET IT FROM, HUH?

178
00:11:13,728 --> 00:11:16,062
YOU SAY A TRUCK?
WHAT KIND OF A TRUCK?

179
00:11:16,062 --> 00:11:16,995
A PENGUIN.
DELIVERY TRUCK.

180
00:11:16,995 --> 00:11:19,462
- A DELIVERY TRUCK?
- A DELIVERY TRUCK?

181
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:21,495
- HUH?
- HUH?

182
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,710
ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THE INFORMATION?

183
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:39,710
YEAH. THEY WERE DOING BUSINESS
BY THE ORBIT DRIVE-IN.

184
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,644
I GET IT.

185
00:11:40,644 --> 00:11:42,244
IT WOULDN'T BE SUSPICIOUS
IF ANYONE SAW

186
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:44,110
A DELIVERY TRUCK
DRIVING AROUND THERE.

187
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,477
SO THEN, HOW ARE WE
GOING TO COUNTER THE HACKS?

188
00:11:47,477 --> 00:11:50,610
DON'T GET YOURSELF HARPOONED.

189
00:11:54,844 --> 00:11:55,977
AND? ANYTHING ELSE?

190
00:11:55,977 --> 00:11:59,477
THEY DARED TO CALL THIS SHIP
A WORTHLESS PIECE OF CRAP,

191
00:11:59,477 --> 00:12:04,244
AND THEY MADE A COMPLETE
MESS OF MY HAMMERHEAD.

192
00:12:04,244 --> 00:12:06,477
UNLIKE SOMEONE ELSE HERE,
I ALWAYS RETURN WHAT I OWE.

193
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:09,510
GEE, WHAT
AN ADMIRABLE VIRTUE.

194
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,077
I'M REALLY NOT UP FOR THIS.

195
00:12:11,077 --> 00:12:15,977
I JUST GOT AN INVOICE FROM
DOOHAN WITH YOUR NAME ON IT.

196
00:12:15,977 --> 00:12:18,210
[EXHALES]

197
00:12:20,777 --> 00:12:23,910
IF THEY'RE PHYSICALLY SENDING
THE COMPUTER VIRUS TO US,

198
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,777
THEN THEY HAVEN'T DEVELOPED
AN ANTIVIRUS PROGRAM FOR IT.

199
00:12:27,777 --> 00:12:28,777
HERE'S THE PLAN.

200
00:12:28,777 --> 00:12:32,577
WE'LL SURPRISE THEM WITH
OUR OWN SECRET WEAPON.

201
00:12:32,577 --> 00:12:35,610
WHAT, JET? THAT'S JUST
A NORMAL TRANSMITTER.

202
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,210
IF WE GET INFECTED
BY THE VIRUS,

203
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,777
CUT OFF THE ENTIRE MONOSYSTEM.

204
00:12:39,777 --> 00:12:41,510
NAVIGATION AND
COMMUNICATIONS WILL CRASH.

205
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,010
EXACTLY. THAT'S WHY
I'M GOING TO ASSIST YOU

206
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,110
THROUGH THIS FROM HERE ON.

207
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,010
THIS USES THE OLD SATELLITE

208
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,610
TRANSMISSION WAVE
SIGNALS FOR GUIDANCE,

209
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:53,544
SO IT IN EFFECT BYPASSES
THE MONOSYSTEM.

210
00:12:54,844 --> 00:12:57,677
AND ANOTHER RUN SCORES
AGAINST THE BLUE SOX.

211
00:12:57,677 --> 00:12:59,577
HENDERSON LOOKS
IN FOR THE SIGN...

212
00:12:59,577 --> 00:13:02,977
THAT'S SOME SECRET WEAPON
YOU GOT THERE, JET.

213
00:13:05,677 --> 00:13:08,744

HIGH AND AWAY. BALL 2.

00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,677
OH! JUST FOUL!

219
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:32,110
IT WAS A PENGUIN
YOU SAID, WASN'T IT?

220
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,077
YEAH. I'M SURE IT WAS
A PURPLE PENGUIN.

221
00:13:41,744 --> 00:13:42,777
NO ONE SAID TWO OF THEM.

222
00:13:42,777 --> 00:13:46,177
WAIT A MINUTE. IT MIGHT BE
A REAL DELIVERY SERVICE.

223
00:13:46,177 --> 00:13:49,644
WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT
IF THEY'RE LEGIT OR NOT.

224
00:13:49,644 --> 00:13:50,777
THAT'S EASY.

225
00:13:50,777 --> 00:13:53,177
WE JUST SHOOT AND SEE WHO
HIGHTAILS IT OUT OF THERE.

226
00:13:53,177 --> 00:13:56,077
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I AGREE WITH YOU ON SOMETHING.

00:13:56,077 --> 00:13:59,444
HUH? WAIT A MINUTE!

228
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:05,110
DID YOU CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY
THEY'RE BOTH REAL?

229
00:14:09,644 --> 00:14:11,244
UH, THEY'RE BOTH RUNNING.

230
00:14:11,244 --> 00:14:14,577
I GUESS WE DIDN'T
DISCUSS THAT OPTION.

231
00:14:16,077 --> 00:14:17,177
YOU HANDLE THAT ONE.

SPREAD THE VIRUS INSIDE.
