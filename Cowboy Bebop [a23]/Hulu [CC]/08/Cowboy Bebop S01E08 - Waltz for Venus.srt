00:20:43,217 --> 00:20:46,151
THE DOCTOR SAYS MY EYES
WILL BE ALL BETTER NOW.

354
00:20:46,151 --> 00:20:47,084
ISN'T IT GREAT?

355
00:20:47,084 --> 00:20:49,384
I WANT THE FIRST THING
I SEE TO BE ROCO.

356
00:20:49,384 --> 00:20:52,251
SO TELL HIM TO COME
AND VISIT ME RIGHT NOW.

357
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,184
TELL HIM I CAN'T WAIT.

358
00:20:57,084 --> 00:21:00,351
OH, SPIKE, IS HE IN JAIL?

359
00:21:00,351 --> 00:21:01,151
NO.

360
00:21:01,151 --> 00:21:05,217
THEN WHY HASN'T
HE COME TO SEE ME?

361
00:21:12,817 --> 00:21:16,384
HE'S DEAD, ISN'T HE?

362
00:21:18,517 --> 00:21:20,917
I SEE.

363
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:22,917
STELLA.

364
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:24,517
IT'S OK. YOU CAN LEAVE NOW.

365
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:25,717
HE MUST HAVE DIED

366
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:30,551
BECAUSE HE WAS DOING SOMETHING
THAT WAS WRONG, I'M SURE.

367
00:21:30,551 --> 00:21:35,284
IT'S BETTER
IF YOU LEAVE FOR TODAY.

368
00:21:39,484 --> 00:21:41,817
IT'S JUST THAT...

369
00:21:41,817 --> 00:21:47,017
I NEVER GOT TO SEE ROCO
ONCE WITH MY OWN EYES.

370
00:21:47,017 --> 00:21:50,884
HEY, WHAT WAS HE REALLY LIKE?

371
00:21:50,884 --> 00:21:54,151
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN
ANYONE WITHOUT LOOKING.

372
00:21:54,151 --> 00:21:55,384
HE WAS A TERRIFIC GUY,

373
00:21:55,384 --> 00:21:59,084
EXACTLY THE PERSON
YOU THOUGHT HE WAS.

374
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:07,184

375
00:24:26,217 --> 00:24:30,084
STARTING NEXT WEEK,

376
00:24:30,084 --> 00:24:31,151
HA HA HA!

377
00:24:31,151 --> 00:24:31,951

378
00:24:31,951 --> 00:24:32,951
UH, WELL,
ED WILL INTRODUCE ED.

379
00:24:32,951 --> 00:24:37,384
FULL NAME EDWARD WONG
HAU PEPELU TIVRUSKY IV.

380
00:24:37,384 --> 00:24:38,851
THAT'S A LONG NAME.

381
00:24:38,851 --> 00:24:39,817
WHO THE HELL IS THIS?

382
00:24:39,817 --> 00:24:42,284
ED MADE UP THAT NAME FOR ED.
ISN'T IT COOL?

383
00:24:42,284 --> 00:24:44,917
IF YOU MADE IT UP,
HOW CAN YOU BE THE FOURTH?

384
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:47,451
NEXT EPISODE,
JAMMING WITH EDWARD.

385
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:49,984
DOES ANYONE
KNOW WHO THIS KID IS?

386
00:24:49,984 --> 00:24:51,184
WATCH IT.
