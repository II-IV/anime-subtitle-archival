358
00:19:26,008 --> 00:19:27,041
I DON'T KNOW.

359
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,008
LET'S HAVE LUNCH FIRST.

360
00:19:28,008 --> 00:19:30,941
YOU ATE LUNCH A FEW
MINUTES AGO, BLAST IT.

361
00:19:30,941 --> 00:19:32,641
REALLY? DID I LIKE IT?

362
00:19:32,641 --> 00:19:34,741
WHO ARE THESE GUYS?

363
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:37,908
DON'T KNOW,
BUT THIS ONE'S LOSING IT.

364
00:19:37,908 --> 00:19:39,341
YOU LEAVE YOUR
BRAIN SOMEWHERE?

365
00:19:39,341 --> 00:19:42,741
YEAH, LIKE YOU CAN TALK,
YOU NUMBSKULL.

366
00:19:42,741 --> 00:19:46,975
ALL MY SAVINGS GONE.
I'LL NEVER GET IT BACK NOW.

367
00:19:46,975 --> 00:19:48,908
DAMN IT. GODDAMN IT!

368
00:19:48,908 --> 00:19:52,741
ANYONE, EVERYONE, YOU KNOW.

369
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:54,741
IT'S ALL A MISTAKE!

370
00:19:54,741 --> 00:19:56,575
[SCREAMING]

371
00:19:58,975 --> 00:20:00,875
[LAUGHING]

372
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,008
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH HIM?

373
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,675
THE OLD DUFFER'S OUT OF TOUCH.

374
00:20:11,675 --> 00:20:15,308
HE CAN'T RECALL YESTERDAY,
LET ALONE 50 YEARS AGO.

375
00:20:15,308 --> 00:20:18,808
LUCKY FOR HIM,
HEX IS NO LONGER HERE.

376
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:23,875
THERE'S NO ONE LEFT BUT AN OLD
MAN WHO LOVES TO PLAY GAMES.

377
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:28,943
HEX WAS FURIOUS.

378
00:20:28,943 --> 00:20:31,104
HE WANTED REVENGE,
AND THIS IS HOW HE GOT IT.

379
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,004
HE SET UP THE STING
TO KICK IN 50 YEARS LATER

380
00:20:33,004 --> 00:20:34,437
WHEN THE GATE WAS PRE-SCHEDULED

381
00:20:34,437 --> 00:20:37,471
FOR ITS FIRST
AUTOMATIC TECH UPGRADE.

382
00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:38,604
IT WAS ALL PLANNED OUT.

383
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:41,771
HE EVEN ARRANGED FOR HIS
OPERATIVES TO CARRY CHESS PIECES

384
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:45,071
TO LET YOU KNOW THAT HE HAD
FINALLY GOTTEN BACK AT YOU.

385
00:20:45,071 --> 00:20:48,904
BUT 50 YEARS IS A LONG TIME.

386
00:20:48,904 --> 00:20:50,004
HEX GOT OLD.

387
00:20:50,004 --> 00:20:50,904
THEN HE GOT SENILE.

388
00:20:50,904 --> 00:20:52,104
HE COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT

389
00:20:52,104 --> 00:20:56,104
THE TRAPS THAT
HE HIMSELF HAD SET.

390
00:20:56,104 --> 00:20:58,071
WELL, IT'S BETTER
FOR YOU THIS WAY.

391
00:20:58,071 --> 00:20:59,937
YOU KNOW HE WON'T
EXPOSE YOU NOW.

392
00:20:59,937 --> 00:21:02,404
YOUR DIRTY LITTLE SECRET
WILL REMAIN A SECRET.

393
00:21:02,404 --> 00:21:04,104
HE CAN'T TELL ANYONE

394
00:21:04,104 --> 00:21:06,404
ABOUT THE DEFECTS
YOU BUILT INTO THE GATES.

395
00:21:06,404 --> 00:21:07,737
SO THAT'S IT, THEN.

396
00:21:07,737 --> 00:21:09,237
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

397
00:21:09,237 --> 00:21:12,271
YOU JUST HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT US.

398
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,737
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

399
00:21:13,737 --> 00:21:15,104
MONEY? IS THAT IT?

400
00:21:15,104 --> 00:21:16,371
COME ON. SAY IT.

401
00:21:16,371 --> 00:21:21,337
WHAT'S YOUR PRICE TO KEEP FROM
LEAKING THIS THING TO THE PRESS?

402
00:21:21,337 --> 00:21:24,737
JUST LEAVE THE OLD GUY ALONE.

403
00:21:24,737 --> 00:21:26,104
CALL OFF THE BOUNTY HUNTERS.

404
00:21:26,104 --> 00:21:27,971
THAT'S ALL WE ASK.

405
00:21:27,971 --> 00:21:29,437
YOU SEE, ED WOULD BE UNHAPPY

406
00:21:29,437 --> 00:21:33,004
IF SHE LOST
HER FAVORITE CHESS PARTNER,

407
00:21:33,004 --> 00:21:37,771
AND WE WOULDN'T WANT THAT
TO HAPPEN, NOW, WOULD WE?

408
00:21:43,171 --> 00:21:45,271
ARE YOU PLAYING AGAIN?

409
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:46,837
NOT AGAIN.

410
00:21:46,837 --> 00:21:47,904
ED'S STILL PLAYING.

411
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:52,471
YOU MEAN YOU'VE PLAYED
THE SAME GAME FOR A WEEK?

412
00:21:52,471 --> 00:21:53,804
MMHMM.

413
00:21:53,804 --> 00:21:55,004
I SEE.

414
00:21:55,004 --> 00:21:57,971
WELL, GOOD LUCK, ED.

415
00:22:00,004 --> 00:22:02,871
YO, NEWBY, YOU'RE
IN A GOOD MOOD TODAY.

00:22:06,104 --> 00:22:07,737

421
00:22:14,037 --> 00:22:18,137

WAIT A MINUTE.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

427
