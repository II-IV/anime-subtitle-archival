00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:21,980
karuma nando mo onaji koto wo kurikaeshi no naka wo
Karma, in the midst of ever-repeating events

2
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:31,420
ochite itta
it fell...

3
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:38,470
karuma kono karada wa rasen no you
Karma; this body is like a spiral

4
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:52,100
umare kawatte mo nao mayoi tsuzuketeru
Even if it's reborn, yet it continues to wander

5
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:15,010
yasuraka ni... owari ni shiyou
Tenderly... bring it to an end

6
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:26,180
onore no aza de
With my own birthmark

7
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,650
I have to kill... or I'll be killed!

8
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:06,680
Are you awake?

9
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,230
{Training}

10
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,360
There is no need to be afraid.

11
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,630
I won't attack you anymore.

12
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,410
You are...

13
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,710
If you are asking about my name, I don't have one.

14
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,380
If you don't know what to call me, call me Ein.

15
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,630
That's what they call me, after all.

16
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,500
Ein.

17
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,050
Why did you attack me?

18
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,590
To show that you had talent.

19
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,590
Talent?

20
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,640
You have a talent you were born with.

21
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,910
A talent for killing.

22
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,120
A talent for surviving.

23
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,060
An assassin's talent.

24
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,110
That can't be...

25
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,930
I don't get it.

26
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,450
Anyway, what basis do you have for...

27
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,490
You tried to kill me, didn't you?

28
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:14,510
In that situation, a normal human would have fallen into a panic and been killed.

29
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,110
However, you are different.

30
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,600
You took action before you understood the situation and survived.

31
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,510
Zwei.

32
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,060
Zwei?

33
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,050
That's your name.

34
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,840
You're wrong.

35
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,520
Don't make up weird names!

36
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,950
I have a proper name...!

37
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,790
My name... is...

38
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,340
You don't have one, anymore.

39
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,370
There is no point in thinking about it.

40
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,580
What do you mean?!

41
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,460
Your memories were erased.

42
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,190
By Inferno.

43
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,300
Wonderful.

44
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,340
The journalist, who was shot and killed...

45
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,280
Your Phantom is a masterpiece, Scythe Master
The journalist, who was shot and killed...

46
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,020
...is thought to have been caught up in a syndicate's inner struggles.  Now then-
Your Phantom is a masterpiece, Scythe Master

47
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,480
...is thought to have been caught up in a syndicate's inner struggles.  Now then-

48
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,020
It is an honor, Mr. McGuire
...is thought to have been caught up in a syndicate's inner struggles.  Now then-

49
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,360
This style... it's hard to believe it is the work of a kid.

50
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,050
That's right...

51
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,240
That's why I bestowed upon her the title of Phantom.

52
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,410
Your accomplishments are great.

53
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:31,240
You've created an apparition that is not of this world, after all.

54
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,480
No... this is due to Ms McCunnen's support.

55
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,960
You have a good subordinate, Claudia.

56
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,190
By the way...

57
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,590
I heard you had difficulties exterminating that journalist.

58
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,600
No, it's nothing like that...

59
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,200
I heard he saw the site of the disposal... a normal tourist.

60
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,950
I don't know where you heard that, but all witnesses have been disposed of.

61
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,570
The corpses have been accounted for, also.

62
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,650
Oh...?  That's wonderful.

63
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,610
And did you use Phantom for that as well?

64
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,020
Yes.

65
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,310
You were supposed to have been killed.

66
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,600
For the sake of completely erasing all evidence.

67
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:25,410
However, Master recognized that talent and thought it would be a waste to kill you.

68
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,720
Master?

69
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,500
Scythe Master... my master.

70
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,840
Master stole your memories and prepared a new life for you.

71
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,790
An Inferno member.

72
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,740
A life as an assassin.

73
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,240
An assassin?  Me?

74
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,750
We are going to have you become my other half, Zwei.

75
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,210
Don't say such stupid things!

76
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,960
Why would I do such a... become a murderer...!?

77
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,310
It's all right to refuse.

78
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,310
However, at that time...

79
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,830
...you'll have you die as originally planned.

80
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,600
Right here, right now.

81
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,250
If you want to live, you must change.

82
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,360
Now, your existence is only validated by killing people.

83
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,660
I...

84
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,040
...don't want to die!

85
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,360
This is a dream.

86
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,810
This... All of this is a bad dream.

87
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,880
If thinking like that comforts you, that's fine.

88
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,930
Just think of it as one big dream

89
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,190
However, it will be a very long dream.

90
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,100
Change into that.

91
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,570
From now on after six in the morning, you are with me.

92
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,610
You will obey all instructions.

93
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:16,620
Understood?

94
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,820
Let's begin.

95
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,820
Zwei's progress is steady.

96
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,130
He is obediently completing his training.

97
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,390
He's quite submissive...

98
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:51,290
With that difficult training every day, even basic thought becomes painful.

99
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,020
Yes, that is basics of training.

100
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:59,110
I will show you results that will not betray your expectations, Ms. McCunnen.

101
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,620
Did you think I had expectations?

102
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,420
My pawns are your pawns.

103
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,830
Everything is for Inferno, after all.

104
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,130
This is how you hold it.

105
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,340
Don't put your finger over the trigger.

106
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,660
Put your power in your fingers, not your shoulders; grip it with both hands.

107
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,730
This is the rear sight.  This is the forward sight.

108
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,390
You aim by aligning the valley of the rear sight with the forward sight.

109
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:37,090
When you take position, straighten your right arm, and put tension in your left.

110
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,630
It will stabilize the gun.

111
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,910
Even so, most of the power should go into your fingers, not your arms.

112
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:48,870
When you pull the trigger, don't hurry; squeeze it gently.

113
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:51,630
Fire.

114
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,700
Fire the remaining five shots one after the other.

115
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,800
At this distance, you should be able to hit it every time.

116
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,900
Once you can do that, we'll work on speed.

117
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,240
Your goal is six shots in four seconds.

118
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,240
Concentrate on making hits first.

119
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,640
That's still too slow.

120
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:57,400
It looks like you've got the accuracy, but at that rate, you'll die before you can shoot down your target.

121
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,520
Repeat. Repeat.

122
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,800
I will complete the tasks I am given.

123
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,050
If I do that, I don't need to think...

124
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,480
If I do that, I will be at ease.

125
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,770
I will even forget the many questions I have.

126
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,430
My everday life will disappear.

127
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,800
I'm going out.

128
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,350
The training menu is the same as usual.

129
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,020
Going out?

130
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,390
It's work.

131
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,820
Let's go, Phantom.

132
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,720
Yes, Master.

133
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,590
Master?

134
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,790
That man is... Scythe Master.

135
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,000
It's the first sniping mission in a while.

136
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,430
Well, it is an easy one for you.

137
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,450
The distance to the target is seven hundred yards.

138
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,480
You'll be using the Remington .308 for this.

139
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,390
The weather at the site is cloudy with a gentle breeze.

140
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,760
The weather center said there will be no changes until tomorrow morning.

141
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,540
The details are in that folder.

142
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,520
Any questions?

143
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,540
No.

144
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,710
Very good.

145
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,110
By the way, how is Zwei?

146
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,320
His basic training is pretty much complete.

147
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,820
From tomorrow on, we will begin a different training.

148
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,880
I guess it's about time that I readied a practical exam.

149
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,840
Don't worry about me.  Continue.

150
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,860
I guess I should say 'Nice to meet you'?

151
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,330
I am Claudia McCunnen.

152
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:44,880
Is there anything you are concerned about me other than my name?

153
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,530
No.

154
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:52,580
However, you <i>are</i> interested in Inferno, the
organization that picked you up, aren't you?

155
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,490
Since you didn't answer, I'll take that as a "yes."

156
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:05,980
Inferno is... Hmm... I guess you'd say a group that is trying to create a different type of order in a world without that order.

157
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:13,420
If you consider gangs and mafia as countries of their own, Inferno would be something like the UN.

158
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,690
What Inferno is aiming for is the unification of the underworld.

159
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,080
That kind of a dreamlike story wouldn't have even been worthy of being called a joke just a little while ago...

160
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,280
However, the thing that is bringing that to life is...

161
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,990
Phantom.

162
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,270
Yes, your instructor.

163
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,540
Phantom's power is absolute.

164
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:53,050
She, who can absolutely eliminate any target, has Inferno's greatest trust and bestows the greatest fear upon resistant organizations.

165
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:57,700
She is the greatest assassin.

166
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,770
However...

167
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,840
In the end, we are people who are just being used by the organization...

168
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,150
Both Phantom and I...

169
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,860
We have no choice but to live like slaves.

170
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:21,110
It's true that we only offer you a single way of life.

171
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,000
However, you aren't a slave.

172
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,000
Even you have freedom.

173
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,180
It's called "speed."

174
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,350
Speed?

175
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:45,440
Even if it is a determined course, as long as you desire it and work for it, you can accelerate as much as you want.

176
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,380
You might even come to stand at the pinnacle of the organization.

177
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,810
How to run through it is up to you, after all.

178
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,840
Don't ever think of yourself as a slave again.

179
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:14,880
As long as you think that way, you are
giving victory to those who belittle you.

180
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:47,160
I wanted to talk about this with you more, but I have work I can't get away from.

181
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,590
Goodbye, Zwei.

182
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,960
Cars, you see, are things that <i>people</i> drive...

183
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,010
Not puppets.

184
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:09,850
{The next episode will air at 2.45am on April 16th (Th)}

185
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:22,490
Even if it is a determined course, as long as you desire it and work for it, you can accelerate as much as you want.

186
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:31,290
Desire... striving... I had long-since forgotten those words.

187
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,250
Ein?

188
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,250
What?

189
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:21,010
Did you kill someone during today's mission?

190
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,350
Yes.

191
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:27,390
Why did you become a killer?

192
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,130
I don't know.

193
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,230
I wasn't taught anything about my past.

194
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,400
That is...

195
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,550
That's right.  I'm the same as you.

196
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,160
I also had my memories erased and was made into an assassin.

197
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,660
However, what about it?

198
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,330
Now, at this moment, I have survived.

199
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,920
That's all that matters.

200
00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:02,970
Assassins have neither a past nor a future.

201
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,170
However, a person named Claudia said...

202
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,430
Claudia?

203
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,970
She came here this afternoon.

204
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,570
She said that we weren't slaves, that we had freedom.

205
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,030
If you want to believe that, then do so.

206
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:28,040
However, eventually you will come to the point where you don't feel anything.

207
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:32,460
Because there is no other way to endure this way of life.

208
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,900
Eventually, you will become this way too.

209
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,580
When you've killed someone, you'll understand.

210
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,910
Pulling the trigger is easy.

211
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,910
As is aiming... if it's just a brick.

212
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,160
But... but...

213
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,250
Fire.

214
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,970
Fire... Zwei.

215
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,980
Zwei.

216
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:59,980
yami ni iraretara massakasama ni
If stays in darkness, it turns upside down

217
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:06,520
ashi wo jama ni shi fukaku nikushimi wa tawawa ni
The foot is caught deeply; Hate is looming

218
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:13,280
kyoushitsu wa hana to sabi midare minoru yume no kashi
The classroom is flowers and rust; ripening dreams of pastries

219
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,260
nou dake se dake harawata
only the brain, only the back; guts

220
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,340
te wo kake yo
offer your hand

221
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,580
mei wo made
hold the command

222
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:35,960
souhaku ni hiraku yubi
Fingers that open palely

223
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,200
mamieru mae ni
Before facing it

224
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,650
moshi mo omae ga
If you

225
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,950
nousatsu sanagara mayoi netami
are bewitched and jealous

226
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:50,790
uchikudaku koto dekiyou ka
can you break it

227
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,310
monzetsu se yo
Faint in agony

228
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,280
tada kudasuru toki ha
But when you drop off

229
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,420
risei wo tori
and acquire reason

230
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:03,930
chi wo haki doku ni mamire
Blood is smeared by poisoned vomit

231
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,920
naraku e no mukawan
Head to hell

232
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,440
soko de shika mienai
Only there you can see

233
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:17,960
ten wo aogi yaketadare teyuku asu wo warae yo
Face the sky and laugh at the burnt sky

234
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,370
{Horizontal - Next Episode}
{Vertical - Practise}

235
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,670
This is a continuation of the dream.

236
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:33,680
A dream you will never awaken from, until you die.

237
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:39,810
