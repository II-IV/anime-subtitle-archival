1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,530
Who is the next target?

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,090
Frank Claude.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,440
We finally figured out his location.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,860
Do you intend to use that unknown group again?

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,400
I believe it was already decided that we would dispatch them.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,490
You are going to make a show of it, aren't you?

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,500
In order to announce our existence, it is a necessary measure.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,630
Their power shall become a conflagration and shall burn hell to nothing.

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,630
We shall construct our world there.

10
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,810
You're injured?

11
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,310
It's only a scratch.

12
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,120
I will... kill.

13
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:54,140
I will kill... so I can live!

14
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:18,500
karuma nando mo onaji koto wo kurikaeshi no naka wo
Karma, in the midst of ever-repeating events

15
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:27,940
ochite itta
it fell...

16
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:34,990
karuma kono karada wa rasen no you
Karma; this body is like a spiral

17
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:48,620
umare kawatte mo nao mayoi tsuzuketeru
Even if it's reborn, yet it continues to wander

18
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:11,530
yasuraka ni... owari ni shiyou
Tenderly... bring it to an end

19
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:22,700
onore no aza de
With my own birthmark

20
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,390
Awaken

21
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,350
I'll be killed...

22
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,620
If I don't run, I'll be killed.

23
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,440
I can't run from those black eyes.

24
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,660
What should I do?

25
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,040
If I can't run away, I have to kill.

26
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,790
I have to kill, or I will be killed!

27
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,490
Where am I?

28
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,780
What is this?

29
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,220
What was I...?

30
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,890
Who am I?

31
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,750
I don't know my name.

32
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,640
What...?

33
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,210
Japanese?

34
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,620
Vacation luggage...

35
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,900
This is me...

36
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,980
I am a Japanese tourist, and...

37
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,520
Why? Why can't I remember?

38
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:05,280
They might be nearby... the people who attacked me!

39
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,910
Don't go around by yourself, Clo.

40
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,580
You'll negate the meaning of having a bodyguard in the first place.

41
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,790
Do you want to ride in my car?

42
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,710
Oh dear.

43
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,590
Don't worry.  I'm only going to take a look at the situation.

44
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,720
I can't leave all of it in that man's hands.

45
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,750
Right about now, that snake of a man is playing with an extraordinary toy.

46
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,800
Geez, he makes me want to puke.

47
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,740
However, his contributions to the organization are great.

48
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,880
That doll is McGuire's favorite, after all.

49
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,500
We'll use anything for the sake of our objective.

50
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,040
That's Inferno's motto.

51
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,410
I know.

52
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:53,240
However, Clo, you cross too many lines.

53
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,070
If something happens, contact me.

54
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,250
I'm depending on you, Lizzy.

55
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,430
If it weren't for that driving...

56
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,860
Situational decision rate, 074

57
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,210
Atavism numbers 087

58
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,090
To have reached these numbers only a few minutes after awakening...

59
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,730
I believe I said it before.

60
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,940
He's an outstanding talent.

61
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,910
I'm going to descend into hell, aren't I?

62
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,170
No... I've probably already fallen.

63
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,400
What was that sensory ability just now?

64
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,010
It is the core nature of the animal.

65
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:14,760
What you might call wild instincts hidden behind the veil of reason.

66
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,880
However, not yet. Not yet.

67
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,460
He has yet to reach the level I'm looking for.

68
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,700
It's your turn, Phantom.

69
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,960
However, don't overdue it.

70
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,170
Yes, Master.

71
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,050
If you don't want to die...

72
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,080
Those eyes...!

73
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,710
...come at me seriously.

74
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:27,110
Danger to the spirit, danger to life, and danger to existence...

75
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:33,310
The only way of dealing with that is to use the survival instincts within you.

76
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,460
The ones who rely on morality and kindness,

77
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:47,390
thinking that their own safety is guaranteed,

78
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,670
are weak humans who have given up living.

79
00:08:54,450 --> 00:09:01,010
I absolutely loathe this world where traits like that have become the norm.

80
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,900
Well, if it isn't Ms. McCunnen.

81
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,610
If I had known you would be coming here...

82
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,380
What is the situation?

83
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,920
I believe we will get results in a moment.

84
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,910
Will you observe?

85
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,630
Yes.

86
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,880
Then, right this way.

87
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,540
Who is it?

88
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,120
Why am I being targeted?!

89
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,600
I don't even know the reason.

90
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,700
I don't even know where this is.

91
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,110
I don't even know who I am.

92
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,160
I can't get away.

93
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,210
There is nowhere for you to go.

94
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,220
I can't get away...

95
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,720
You and I...

96
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,630
...have to kill...

97
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,710
...or I'll be killed!

98
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,420
It's about to start.

99
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,140
Start?

100
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,050
Look closely.

101
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,550
Why?!

102
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,840
Come at me seriously, if you don't want to die.

103
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,970
There is nothing.

104
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,150
Past or future.

105
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,550
Not even life.

106
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,930
Even so, I...

107
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,860
...don't want to die!

108
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,970
Where should I go?

109
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,560
Even though I don't know where I came from...

110
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,420
Even though I don't have any memories...

111
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,920
What should I do to become free?

112
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,710
How is freedom gained through killing?

113
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,400
Tell me... I beg you!

114
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,700
Where is this?!

115
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:14,740
I... Who am I?!

116
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,720
Zwei.

117
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,720
Who are you?

118
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,720
I am Ein; you are Zwei.

119
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,260
Zwei...?

120
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,770
That is your name.

121
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,830
From now on, your name is Zwei.

122
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,500
Zwei?

123
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,260
What is that?

124
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,380
What do you mean-

125
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,970
You are me.

126
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,370
I am you.

127
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,050
What do you think?

128
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,760
Is he not a wonderful human resource?

129
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,220
Even so, those were perfect results.

130
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,610
This boy has not had any training; he also has no tactical knowledge.

131
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,610
He took those actions entirely based on the instincts he was born with.

132
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,940
What's more, he momentarily surpassed Ein.

133
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,150
Pathetic, Phantom.

134
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,720
My apologies.

135
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,510
He's a genius.

136
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:36,550
He has talents which only manifested when his life was in great danger.

137
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:42,390
He is most certainly a human born to be integrated into Inferno.

138
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,070
Even so, would he desire that?

139
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,160
There is no egg that would reject surpassing the world.

140
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,230
Nor is it possible that there would be a seed that did not desire to blossom.

141
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,890
It isn't a matter of will.

142
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,910
Brainwashing... Your specialty, huh?

143
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,470
It's perfect.

144
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:05,410
By using drugs and hypnotism, we seal only the memories that involve his own identity.

145
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,560
Please understand, Ms. McCunnen.

146
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,340
This is merciful.

147
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,340
He encountered an extremely unfortunate sight.

148
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:24,340
Ordinarily, he would have been a witness who would have been disposed of.

149
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:30,890
However, I myself desire to bestow upon him a life where he can blossom.

150
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,540
A lone, Japanese tourist, eh?

151
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,510
This could be troublesome.

152
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,280
It is no longer possible for anyone to discover his footprints.

153
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,230
His secrecy is complete.

154
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,690
Fine.

155
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:51,280
Scythe Master, I'll leave this boy to you.

156
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,250
Thank you.

157
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,910
Ein and Zwei...

158
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,770
How about you think about the names of your students a bit more?

159
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:09,060
I wonder just how much longer you will be able to give me orders like that, little girl?

160
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:25,570
I am the number one woman, Ein.

161
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,540
You are the number two man, Zwei.

162
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,080
We are...

163
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,380
What are you doing?

164
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,810
That's enough, Ein.

165
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,260
Return to your post.

166
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,500
Yes Master.

167
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:56,980
We are ghosts who cannot exist anywhere. We are now phantoms.

168
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,180
Welcome home, Master!

169
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,890
Hi, where are the others?

170
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,640
Yes, they are all resting.

171
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,540
During the middle of the day?

172
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,370
What's going on?

173
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:17,850
You are...!

174
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,370
Phantom.

175
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,580
Phantom... Inferno's greatest assassin.

176
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,460
The title of the organization's top sniper.

177
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,550
My greatest masterpiece.

178
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,750
And, he as well.

179
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,310
That's overdoing it...

180
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,310
I see...

181
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,350
That's the end of his organization.

182
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,330
This means that two of the five organizations in Las Vegas have now been crushed.

183
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,610

You are...

208
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,360

This series is fiction.
All names and character who incidently share the name with a real life person are just by coincidence.
Note:
Ein (One), Zwei (Two): Those are german words for the number 1 (Eins, one) and 2 (Zwei, two),
but could also describe the rank (1 > 2)
