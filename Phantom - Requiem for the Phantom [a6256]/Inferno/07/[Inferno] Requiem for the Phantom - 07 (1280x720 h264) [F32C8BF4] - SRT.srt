1
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,860
I want you to do another job for me in Los Angeles soon.

2
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,660
But I thought we were shifting our activities to the East Coast...

3
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,180
McGuire and the others didn't order this operation.

4
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,920
This is for me to get some points.

5
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,870
You want to do an unexpected job,

6
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,800
to make the higher ups owe you one?

7
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,170
Yes.

8
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,130
That's why we need to do this in a clandestine manner.

9
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,810
I'm not personally against such plotting.

10
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,670
I thought so.

11
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,750
Very well.

12
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,630
I'll make sure everything is done secretly.

13
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,490
This will show how important Phantom is.

14
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,260
That was the weekly weather forecast.

15
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,000
We will continue with the breaking news.

16
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,010
Who was that?

17
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,720
I have a shift change where I work part time.

18
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,520
They asked me if I could come now.

19
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,020
I see.

20
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,420
I'll drive you there.

21
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,440
I was planning on practicing my driving today.

22
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,970
You don't have to.

23
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,220
Isn't that normal for a couple that's living together?

24
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,500
I guess so.

25
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,860
In other news.

26
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,860
The drug market on the West Coast...

27
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,560
...has been under the rule of the Chinese mafia for a long time.

28
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,840
But lately, a Japanese organization has been very active with their interventions.

29
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,380
This has resulted in frequent fights within the vicinity of Chinatown.

30
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,390
According to the reports,
the issue could develop into a large conflict...

31
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,100
Be careful.

32
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,670
Don't worry.

33
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,600
I won't get involved in that.

34
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,410
I'm not talking about that.

35
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,540
I don't want anyone finding this place because of a commotion.

36
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,990
R-Right...

37
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,870
Were you going out?

38
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,960
Ms McCunnen.

39
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,680
Want to hang out with me?

40
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,330
I'm sorry. I have to practice my driving.

41
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,160
Then you can practice it with this.

42
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,720
I'll walk there.

43
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,030
So? Do you like this car?

44
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,780
It feels like you could go on forever, right?

45
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,660
Doesn't it feel like you're the ruler of the world?

46
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,840
No way.

47
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,800
It's just to show off.

48
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,640
I'm amazed you manged to stop.

49
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,270
A little more and it would have been the end for us.

50
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,730
End?

51
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,790
Nothing would end.

52
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,570
Even if I died...

53
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,740
Just because there's one less murderer...

54
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,960
You can't.

55
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,040
You can't die in vain.

56
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,630
I'll decide where you die.

57
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,640
The man who earned my trust has that right.

58
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,560
Move.

59
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,380
We'll keep moving forward, Zwei.

60
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,630
This mission wasn't part of the plan.

61
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,570
Well, think of it as a part time job.

62
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,410
Okay.

63
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,350
Looks like Claudia has some kind of attachment to Zwei.

64
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,310
Make sure she doesn't steal him.

65
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,010
Even if she did, that wouldn't pose a problem.

66
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:29,570
Zwei's existence isn't vital for me to carry out my missions.

67
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,320
That's true.

68
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:36,900
This pairing with Zwei is just the result of a coincidence anyway.

69
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,140
You can drive a bit longer.

70
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,470
Come back in about an hour.

71
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,900
What's going on?

72
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,760
Get used to driving a car like this.

73
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,480
Okay.

74
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,900
Have some fun, Zwei.

75
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,960
That's a pretty nice car.

76
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,390
Is it okay for you to meet me like this?

77
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,780
You needn't worry.

78
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,330
I made sure to cover my tracks.

79
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,900
That's why you can speak openly here.

80
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,340
I'm glad to hear that.

81
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:34,430
I thought about your plan thoroughly.

82
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,610
So, you provide the weapons and other necessary things,

83
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,610
and we provide the soldiers.

84
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,020
These are the conditions, right?

85
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,000
Correct.

86
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:49,140
Then we can have 500kg of cocaine
worth 200 million dollars, right?

87
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:54,210
That'll work in our favor.
We won't have to struggle with funding.

88
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,160
Right?

89
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,290
Yes.

90
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,960
Do you think this is too good to be true?

91
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,560
Ms McCunnen, I fail to see...

92
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,320
...what you would gain by offering such favorable terms to us.

93
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,920
I want the Godoh Group to owe me a favor.

94
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,650
Someone with a strong sense of duty like you would owe me a favor. That's all.

95
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,510
So you want someone to back you up?

96
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,720
Right.

97
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,090
I'll give you these 200 million dollars.

98
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,860
But I'll gain something even more valuable than that.

99
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,650
It certainly makes business sense.

100
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,340
That's fine.

101
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,550
Either way, we've made our decision.

102
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,200
We're on board.

103
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:20,670
This pairing with Zwei is just the result of a coincidence anyway.

104
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,820
I'm an INN reporter.

105
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,190
I have a favor to ask.

106
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,570
Take this.

107
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,740
What's this?

108
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,210
Just give it to the police.

109
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,170
I'm counting on you!

110
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,530
Hold on!

111
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,730
Why... did this happen...

112
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:33,920
I'm sick of this.

113
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,520
I'm hungry.

114
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,900
What day is it?

115
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,260
I want to go back to Japan...

116
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,130
It's quiet...

117
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,890
Maybe this is my chance...

118
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,930
No. If I go out, I'll be found immediately.

119
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,930
She'll kill me.

120
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,730
He's still alive after causing so much trouble for Phantom?

121
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,180
He sure is something.

122
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,600
While suppressing his hunger and fear,

123
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,940
he chose to shut himself inside here.

124
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,520
He judged that this was the only way to survive,

125
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,730
and his instincts kept suppressing his urges.

126
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,620
Interesting.

127
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,210
He's very interesting.

128
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,900
Zwei...

129
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,310
Zwei. Wake up.

130
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,580
We're going out. Get ready.

131
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,810
We have a mission for tonight.

132
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,490
We'll scout the place while it's still bright outside.

133
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:04,750
Tonight at 2200, 500kg of cocaine will be brought here.

134
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,720
And Inferno will take that?

135
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,310
Our mission is to back up the raid squad.

136
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,350
Is that raid squad reliable?

137
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,110
Looks like Claudia has some kind of attachment to Zwei.

138
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,100
Make sure she doesn't steal him.

139
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,940
I haven't heard anything.

140
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,030
So this is a mission for Phantom, huh?

141
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,890
Let's go back.

142
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,280
We have to get the weapons.

143
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,000
Ein, do you dream?

144
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,170
Dream?

145
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,420
Seeing a place you haven't seen before.

146
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,600
Meeting strangers.

147
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,570
I wonder if...

148
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,500
...such dreams are actually my memories...

149
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,390
I don't know.

150
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,250
Don't you dream?

151
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,370
Sometimes I dream of colors.

152
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,940
Colors?

153
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:06,040
Yes, colors. And...

154
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:11,950
Wind.

155
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,590
Blue, white, and green.

156
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,720
That's all there is to it.

157
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,800
There's nothing else here.

158
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,800
But it's so bright there...

159
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,940
And the wind is blowing.

160
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,850
A very strong wind.

161
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,540
Is that the scenery of your hometown?

162
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,310
I don't know.

163
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,680
But...

164
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,460
So what?

165
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,510
What will you do if you know about your hometown?

166
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,410
Don't you want to confirm it?

167
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,690
The place left in your memories.

168
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:13,160
That's not our home.

169
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,490
Murderers have...

170
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,710
...no place but here.

171
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,660
There's nothing.

172
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,950
Dreams are just illusions.

173
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,720
They just get in the way of reality.

174
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,070
Yo. It's me.

175
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,010
Lizzie.

176
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,060
I have a message from Clau.

177
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,100
Zwei, go to her place at eight.

178
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,950
That's too sudden.

179
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,140
What's going on?

180
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,350
There's been a little change.

181
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:36,830
I have something big to deal with tonight.

182
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,880
It's been decided that you will protect her in my stead.

183
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,420
Please wait a minute.

184
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,670
We have another order for tonight.

185
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,620
What? I didn't hear anything about that.

186
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,830
Whose orders are they?

187
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,330
Scythe Master's.

188
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,500
It must be one of his arbitrary orders.

189
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,820
Just ignore it.

190
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,640
Clau is your boss, got that?

191
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,520
But...

192
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,420
Be there at eight.

193
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,300
Don't forget it.

194
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,020
Go, Zwei.

195
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,060
Ein.

196
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,780
I'll carry out Master's mission alone.

197
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,560
You should follow Ms McCunnen's orders.

198
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,960
No way...

199
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,070
It's too dangerous.

200
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,280
I'll be fine.

201
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,650
You can't do that all alone...

202
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,660
The one who decides that...

203
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,360
...isn't us.

204
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,510
Yes...

205
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:34,120
Seems like he's doing stuff without me.

206
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,560
Scythe Master isn't stupid.

207
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,500
He's most likely proceeding on his own.

208
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,760
Yes.

209
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,840
Then satisfy his happy little ambitions under your control.

210
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,640
Take the car I hid on Fifth Avenue.

211
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,400
Got it.

212
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,650
Let him have money, drugs or whatever he wants.

213
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,360
But when he crosses that line...

214
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,400
I know. I'll take responsibility for that when the time comes.

215
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:15,370
I'll quickly bury him and his puppet.

216
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,870
Ein.

217
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,630
Be careful.

218
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,140
You too.

219
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,050
If I know my past... myself...

220
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,210
I'm not confident that I can keep going as I am.
