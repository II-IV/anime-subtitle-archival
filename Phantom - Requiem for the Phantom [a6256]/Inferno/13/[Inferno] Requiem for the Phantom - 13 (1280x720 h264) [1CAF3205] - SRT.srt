1
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,440
Five million dollars!

2
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,770
Fucked around in my territory and stole five million.

3
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,040
There's no way I can forgive whoever did it.

4
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,090
Catch whoever did it and bring them to me at once.

5
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,840
If needed,

6
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,630
kill them.

7
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,140
Thanks, Reiji.

8
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,780
This has always been my dream!

9
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:11,980
Making a mountain of burgers and stuffing myself full with it!

10
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,950
Anyway, Cal,

11
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,690
back to what we were talking about.

12
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,040
You saw the person who killed Judy?

13
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,100
You know, I'm thinking about what I should do about that.

14
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,910
What?

15
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,950
Can we really avenge Judy?

16
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,250
How?

17
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,670
I mean, they have machine guns.

18
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,800
You don't believe in me?

19
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,690
Well, you don't look strong at all.

20
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,480
I see.

21
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,100
So you don't believe in me.

22
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,640
But don't worry.

23
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,630
I won't be the one doing it.

24
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,270
I'm going to ask my friend.

25
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,990
Friend?

26
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,020
Yeah.

27
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,160
You have a friend who's capable of doing it?

28
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,240
I might not seem like it, but I know a lot of people.

29
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:08,100
As long as my friend knows the offender's looks and clothing, he can find them.

30
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,180
So tell me about the killer-

31
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,080
I want to see it.

32
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,170
What?

33
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,720
I want to see the moment when Judy gets avenged with my own eyes.

34
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,420
Hey, Reiji, can you let me meet your friend?

35
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,260
No.

36
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,870
Why?

37
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,010
Let me ask your friend with you!

38
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,020
Can I?

39
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,810
This isn't a world that outsiders can interfere in.

40
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,480
But-

41
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,850
No means no.

42
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,480
Sorry, Cal, but...

43
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,970
OK, fine, I lose.

44
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,040
I'll see if I can get my friend to see you.

45
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,640
Really?

46
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,900
Yeah, but-

47
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,200
Then we'll talk about this when we see your friend.

48
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,810
But those people can't be contacted on a whim.

49
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,340
Tonight, I'll try and find their contacts.

50
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,690
We'll continue our conversation tomorrow.

51
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,310
Tomorrow?

52
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,750
Is something wrong?

53
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,640
I got kicked out this morning because Judy owes a lot of rent.

54
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,570
Can I stay at your place tonight?

55
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,500
How is it, Lizzie?

56
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,260
Is the investigation going well?

57
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,970
Phantom went to search for that girl.

58
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,530
I'm doing my own thing by myself.

59
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,990
Well, just wait a little longer.

60
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,400
I'm looking forward to your good news.

61
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,490
Who is it that's interfering with our business?

62
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,790
The Godoh Group is absolutely necessary for me to gain a standing in Inferno.

63
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,580
I can't stumble because of such things.

64
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,090
So this is where you live.

65
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,250
Somehow it makes me feel lonely.

66
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,790
It's more than enough to live in.

67
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,970
It's empty.

68
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,580
What are you doing?

69
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,690
Throwing away these leftover hamburgers is a waste.

70
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,440
Don't tell me you're going to stay here until you've finished them.

71
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,980
Is something wrong?

72
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:47,200
No, your bedroom is over there.

73
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,400
This bed is yours.

74
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,560
Someone used to live with you before?

75
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,630
Why do you ask?

76
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,650
I just have a feeling.

77
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,730
It was a long time ago.

78
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,920
Your girlfriend?

79
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,920
No.

80
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,820
Oh yeah,

81
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,180
can I borrow your shower?

82
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,390
That means I just have to pretend to be that friend of yours, right?

83
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,870
Yeah, please.

84
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,930
All right. Having you owe me one isn't a bad thing.

85
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,340
So, does that girl really know something about it?

86
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,340
I don't know.

87
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,770
What? That's such an unreliable answer.

88
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,110
Reiji!

89
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,100
Sorry, I forgot my towel.

90
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,660
I'll get one for you right now.

91
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,940
What?

92
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,220
Nothing.

93
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:11,990
It's just that the idea of the great Phantom being toyed around by a little girl is funny.

94
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,240
Don't try anything funny just because you're letting her stay at your-

95
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,560
He hung up.

96
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,620
What are you investigating by sneaking around in my backyard?

97
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,790
So? Lizzie?

98
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,850
Really?

99
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,870
Yeah, it looks like she's going to meet us.

100
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,100
She'll contact us tomorrow.

101
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,600
Thank goodness...

102
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,120
Hey Reiji, do you have any family?

103
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,880
Family?

104
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,690
They're in heaven.

105
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,720
Really?

106
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,450
Yeah.

107
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,490
Just like me.

108
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,590
Are your parents already...

109
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,920
I have no idea.

110
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,590
I ran away from my bastard old man,

111
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,650
and then Judy took me in.

112
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:20,780
If she hadn't, I'd be dead already.

113
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,270
So that's why you're siblings?

114
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,490
Yup, she's my only family.

115
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,110
But Judy died...

116
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,780
Sorry.

117
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,160
It's all right.

118
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:44,160
What's going to happen to me now that Judy's dead?

119
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,240
Where should I go?

120
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,890
What should I do?

121
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,170
I don't have any idea.

122
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,380
I was like you once, not knowing what to do.

123
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,140
There are many ways to die.

124
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,930
There are people who die in pain,

125
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,390
and there are also people who are slowly forgotten without anyone grieving for them.

126
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,860
Judy has you crying for her, so that means she's blessed.

127
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,970
Really?

128
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:14,870
Yeah.

129
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,450
Really?

130
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,330
Yeah.

131
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,040
What's going to happen to me now?

132
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,250
Where should I go?

133
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,960
What should I do?

134
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,480
I don't have any idea.

135
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,420
So is the witness in here?

136
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,130
Your place is a pretty ugly sight.

137
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,520
Don't you think so, Phantom?

138
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,270
May I ask what business you have here?

139
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,660
Don't act so cold.

140
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,000
I saw Lizzie sneaking around getting some street rats to investigate,

141
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,030
and I found out quite a few interesting things.

142
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,000
Let me talk to that girl. I'll make her spit out everything she knows.

143
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,840
Is she in there?

144
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,340
She doesn't know anything.

145
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,050
Move.

146
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:08,120
An outsider like her shouldn't be able to see anything at such a dark place.

147
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,470
She lied about seeing the killer.

148
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,630
Move.

149
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,360
Move.

150
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,460
Phantom!

151
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,000
Oh?

152
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:45,220
So you're going to protect her even if it means you have to cause a bloodbath?

153
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,230
Now I want to see her even more.

154
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,890
This is exactly what I thought.

155
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,450
You and Claudia are definitely plotting something.

156
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:03,700
That's a misunderstanding.

157
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,330
Come to HQ tomorrow.

158
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,190
At ten.

159
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,840
I'll have you guys spit out everything in front of McGuire.

160
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,290
We'll find out who the real traitor is.

161
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,080
Sorry, Phantom.

162
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,100
I couldn't back my way out of it.

163
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,150
Don't worry.

164
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,430
But isn't this bad?

165
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,520
How are you going to convince them tomorrow?

166
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,770
I'll try my best to explain.

167
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,020
So that girl really doesn't...

168
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,530
Yeah, she doesn't know anything.

169
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,180
I see.

170
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:58,080
You don't know anything, right, Cal?

171
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,550
Tell me in detail.

172
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,840
On that night...

173
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,770
Judy?

174
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,710
Judy?!

175
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,990
And that's all I remember...

176
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,280
As I expected.

177
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,910
So you saw through my lie.

178
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,130
That guy just then was Isaac Wisemel, right?

179
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,560
The Bloodies' leader.

180
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,900
Yeah.

181
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,410
Why did you cover for me?

182
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,890
Everyone called you Phantom, right?

183
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,890
I heard about it from Judy's friends.

184
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,680
You're the one that kills people in American gangs.

185
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,500
So you're a true assassin, right?

186
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,720
You're an assassin, right?

187
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,320
The assassin, Phantom.

188
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,290
Yeah, that's right.

189
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,680
Cal?

190
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:43,920
This is...

191
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,510
This is the money that the yakuza was carrying.

192
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,320
There's five million here.

193
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,810
So you stole it?

194
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,450
I didn't steal it!

195
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:57,940
I didn't even use a cent of this dirty money!

196
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,480
I was searching for someone like you.

197
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,370
Someone who'd help me as long as they're paid.

198
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,840
Reiji, you're Phantom, right?

199
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,000
Please! Kill them all!

200
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,460
The guys who were at the alley last night, the guys who shot,

201
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,310
and the guys who were supposed to retrieve the money.

202
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,250
Kill all the people who caused Judy's death...

203
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,070
Can you do it?

204
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,810
I won't charge you that much.

205
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,670
We'll talk about this tomorrow.

206
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,050
I'm sorry for lying.

207
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,080
Same here.

208
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,050
The situation is tilting toward the bad side.

209
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:07,070
The shooters weren't found, but the five million were.

210
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,570
If the organization finds this money, I'll have no excuse.

211
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,530
Kill all the people who caused Judy's death...

212
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,200
What should I do?

213
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,470
How can I reconcile with both Cal and the organization?

214
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,400
What is this, Reiji?

215
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,350
I can't explain to you here.

216
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:51,130
If we talk alone, we'll just provoke Wisemel's suspicion.

217
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,820
I'll explain in front of everyone.

218
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,480
Let's hear your explanation, Phantom.

219
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,520
Yes.

220
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,350
First, let me resolve this misunderstanding.

221
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,410
What do you mean?

222
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:10,190
There is no doubt I was hiding the so-called female witness.

223
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:14,830
However, she's just a relative of a victim who happened to be passing by.

224
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,840
She doesn't know anything.

225
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,140
Why are you so sure?

226
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,140
I am Phantom, and thus, I am skilled at such things.

227
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,770
What a cheap excuse.

228
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,670
I think so, too.

229
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,730
It's pointless since there's no evidence.

230
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,300
Did you use truth serum?

231
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,230
No.

232
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,020
Recording data?

233
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,860
None.

234
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:42,780
That means you're asking us to trust you on your word?

235
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,870
Yes.

236
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,700
Give up, Phantom.

237
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,380
Ms. McCunnen, what do you think?

238
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,880
That's all you've got?

239
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:57,480
I have a reason why I didn't use truth serum.

240
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,170
Oh? Is that enough of a reason to make you point your gun at Isaac?

241
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,020
Yes.

242
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,800
Let me hear it.

243
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,250
I don't want to ruin her.

244
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,670
Don't give me that humanism crap.

245
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,150
No.

246
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,660
I saw a different kind of potential in that girl.

247
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,410
I didn't want to ruin that.

248
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,410
Potential?

249
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,490
Yes. She has a rare quality about her.

250
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,290
You could call it talent.

251
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,040
An intense desire to kill.

252
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,870
Hell-like isolation.

253
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,730
A ghost without a place to live.

254
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,640
Talent... I've heard such words before.

255
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,520
So you mean you want to train that girl into a hitman?

256
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,230
Yes.

257
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,510
She might be able to become a worthy assistant in the future.

258
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,100
And the proof of that girl's talent?

259
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,000
Just a hunch.

260
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,520
Quit fucking around, you bastard!

261
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,610
This isn't something that can be explained by words.

262
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,640
Perhaps it can't be understood by humans who have high suspicions and are blindfolded.

263
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,220
Phantom!

264
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,090
I have a question.

265
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,350
Do you really want a new assistant that much?

266
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:34,230
Are there any problems with working with Lizzie?

267
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,120
Well, there certainly are a lot of problems.

268
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:43,120
Phantom and I are on totally different levels.

269
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,240
Phantom is a great genius and I'm just an ordinary person.

270
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,550
If there's a partner he can set his eyes on,

271
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:52,450
I'd like to switch places as soon as possible.

272
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:59,830
The prostitute who died with the yakuza is named Judy Devens.

273
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,090
Are you sure she's not related to this event?

274
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,280
Yes.

275
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,840
She's as innocent as Snow White.

276
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,600
I've looked into it thoroughly.

277
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,690
What do you think, Isaac?

278
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,230
Are you asking me to agree, Ray?!

279
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,980
If she doesn't show any results...

280
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,240
You know what to expect, right?

281
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,990
Yes.

282
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,000
Then let's see what she's made of.

283
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,050
What an interesting stage play, Reiji.

284
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,260
You won't fool me...

285
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,400
Don't think for a second that you've fooled me...!

286
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,780
You're that fox's bitch!

287
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,280
I'm sorry.

288
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,660
Don't worry, it was my fault anyways.

289
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,480
But...

290
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,720
I know.

291
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,750
There's no way you want to churn out more people like you.

292
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,310
It's a lie to cover up for that kid, right?

293
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:11,040
But the responsibility goes to you for selling her so much.

294
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,620
I know.

295
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,720
In the end, I didn't settle anything.

296
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,480
The shooters... The five million...

297
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,270
Avenging Judy...

298
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,780
What should I do?

299
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,460
That girl is most likely a genius.

300
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:32,010
But should I let her walk the same path as me?
