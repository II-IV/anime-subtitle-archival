1
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,990
Romero...

2
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,670
Romero, let me bring you there...

3
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,800
The place you longed for.

4
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,670
A place where no one can catch up with us.

5
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,640
At a speed fast enough to brush off the past...

6
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,150
...to reach there.

7
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,310
I can't believe you've got work this late.

8
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,960
For my work it doesn't matter what time it is.

9
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,540
Getting tired of becoming an assassin?

10
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,040
Nope.

11
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,590
This might take a while.

12
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,800
You can go to bed.

13
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,560
No, I'll stay up.

14
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,670
I picked up a broken video cassette recorder during the day.

15
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,050
I want to try to fix it.

16
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,360
Just buy a new one.

17
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,820
That's such a waste.

18
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,170
Maybe it can still be used.

19
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,640
It can still be used, huh?

20
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,860
That's right.

21
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,070
Come back soon.

22
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,540
Yeah.

23
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,350
Promise.

24
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,330
Yeah, I promise.

25
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,290
I don't want to leave you...

26
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,500
I want to stay by your side forever.

27
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,720
If I can still return to the way I once was...

28
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,160
...it's time to quit.

29
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,480
Whether I choose to stop or to run...

30
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,150
Whatever I pick, the organization will...

31
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,370
You're late, Lizzie.

32
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,820
Lizzie?

33
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,600
All right, don't move.

34
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,800
Lizzie?

35
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,640
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,610
I'm always giving you trouble.

37
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,540
I've heard about it, brat.

38
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,100
You're that Phantom guy.

39
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:20,320
No wonder my young men were finished off so easily.

40
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,810
Don't play dumb.

41
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,950
I've got solid proof.

42
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,080
Look.

43
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,290
That picture... who...

44
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,840
Was it her?

45
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,410
So?

46
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,100
Not gonna defend yourself?

47
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,920
Mr. Godoh, it's a misunderstanding.

48
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,760
That picture...

49
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,520
Listen to me before you embarrass yourself.

50
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,140
I know your higher-ups ordered you to do it.

51
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,490
We just want to know the inside story.

52
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:11,780
The one behind all three attacks against us was Claudia.

53
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,580
Is that right?

54
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,320
Are you fuckin' stupid?

55
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,480
How much effort do you think Claudia put in to get you guys into Inferno?!

56
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,880
Although I like loyal people,

57
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:31,020
that woman doesn't deserve so much loyalty from you guys.

58
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,440
She tricked us.

59
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,640
Both you guys and us.

60
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,380
Shut the fuck up...

61
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,900
Hey, Miss...

62
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,660
It isn't our first time meeting at this place.

63
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,210
What?

64
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,500
Don't you remember?

65
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,940
That was such a memorable night.

66
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,750
Yeah, it's almost been a year.

67
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,940
A year?

68
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,090
Which organization are they from?!

69
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,260
The lading...

70
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,500
We did it!

71
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,150
It's too early to say that, bro.

72
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,060
Just get the hell out of here!

73
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,730
I see. So it was you guys.

74
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,210
You teamed up with Scythe...

75
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,650
I don't know anyone named Scythe.

76
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,860
The one who planned it was Claudia.

77
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,650
No way!

78
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,970
When we were about to hit a dead end...

79
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,830
That woman came to us out of the blue and offered a deal.

80
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,540
She allowed us to steal 500 kg of cocaine.

81
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:46,550
She prepared everything beforehand, including backup.

82
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,850
She even asked us, "Do you want to have some 'fun' in Los Angeles?"

83
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,100
Why did she do it?!

84
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:04,500
The condition was that after things were settled,
the Godoh Group would join Inferno through her.

85
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,390
At first we didn't understand,

86
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,530
but after finding out her situation, we did.

87
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:16,790
She wants an organization within Inferno that can watch her back.

88
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,500
If she's always alone,

89
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,150
she won't have a chance to shine.

90
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:31,420
That thing about how we used to get cargo from other places is bullshit.

91
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,300
The market we have now was created in the course of one year.

92
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,110
Using the cocaine we stole from you as capital.

93
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,520
Then Claudia sold out Scythe...?

94
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,300
Yeah, there was a retard who got screwed from that.

95
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,780
Is it him? The Scythe you're talking about.

96
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,390
It's me.

97
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,160
There's been a sudden change of plans. Scythe betrayed the organization.

98
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,040
He made Phantom attack Inferno's lading.

99
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,510
The organization is looking for those two with all their might.

100
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,960
They haven't found either of them though.

101
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,840
At that time...

102
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,930
A way to prove your innocence and get Ein back.

103
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,440
You know how to use this, don't you?

104
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,940
It was all because of her...

105
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,410
Scythe!

106
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,540
Because of that, we were hurt and shed tears.

107
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,570
Judging by your looks, it seems like you remembered something.

108
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,630
Is it true, Phantom?!

109
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,510
Seems like even the great Phantom was deceived by a woman.

110
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,600
However, there's a sequel to the story.

111
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:08,820
That bitch wants to kill Shiga and me in the end,

112
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,000
and control the Godoh Group by herself.

113
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,630
On one hand, she's finishing us off in order to seal our mouths.

114
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,950
On the other, she's using the confusion that's caused to remove her rivals.

115
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,910
Even I can't believe how scheming she is.

116
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,280
This is the truth.

117
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,000
Get it? She used us as stepping stones.

118
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,550
I don't give a shit about Inferno anymore.

119
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,890
My name won't be Godoh Daisuke if I don't do anything after being deceived like this!

120
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,820
I don't believe this! I don't fuckin' believe this!

121
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,480
You fucking bastards!

122
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,480
Die!

123
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,440
Shit! Where?!

124
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,350
Where are you?!

125
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,650
It's that one.

126
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,350
Get on, Phantom!

127
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,770
You go on first.

128
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,310
Phantom!

129
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,030
Elen...

130
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,170
Elen...

131
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,770
Impossible... you're still alive?

132
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,680
But why?

133
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,700
Why, Elen?!

134
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,720
Why are you doing this?!

135
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,310
Don't call me Elen.

136
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,040
I am Ein.

137
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,510
Right now and in the past.

138
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,530
I've just been Ein.

139
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,430
Hurry up and escape.

140
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,330
Inferno will come and kill you soon.

141
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,040
Once and for all.

142
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,380
Inferno will?

143
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,460
Elen!

144
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,260
Wait!

145
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,460
Elen!

146
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,960
I am Ein.

147
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,770
Right now and in the past.

148
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,070
It's him, huh?

149
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,120
It's that bastard...

150
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,910
Scythe Master!

151
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,050
Beautiful.

152
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,540
The Godoh Group, Claudia McCunnen,

153
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,630
and Inferno's Issac Wisemel.

154
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,100
Stirring up a three-sided struggle of fear and doubt.

155
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:37,370
Sending the ones who tricked you before to hell one by one.

156
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,370
No, that's not all.

157
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:49,430
The truth behind it was sent to Inferno through my guidance.

158
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,960
They'll take action soon.

159
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,880
They'll kill the traitor, Claudia McCunnen...

160
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,740
and her trusted subordinate, Phantom.

161
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,850
The organization is going to kill me? If so...

162
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,120
Cal!

163
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,560
I see.

164
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,610
You passed the entrance exam.

165
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,860
Congratulations, Mio.

166
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,700
I wanted to tell you right away.
Am I interfering with your work?

167
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,700
Don't worry about that.

168
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:37,530
But foreign trading is tiring, right?

169
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,670
Yeah, it is.

170
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,800
I need to leave Japan the day after tomorrow to deliver stuff.

171
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,640
Do you want any gifts?

172
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,510
No, it's fine since you always buy them.

173
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:54,290
Besides, if I receive too much from you, mom will find out.

174
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,080
I see...

175
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,270
That's true.

176
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,630
My friends are waiting for me.

177
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,400
Have fun.

178
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,940
See you again.

179
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,460
Okay!

180
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:40,450
Although she was kept apart from the main family,
the same blood of me and the boss flows inside Mio.

181
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,470
The blood of the Godoh's demons.

182
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,340
If someone tries to take advantage of that,

183
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:52,250
Mio won't be able to protect herself since she doesn't know anything.

184
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,750
No matter that her standpoint or surname changed,

185
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,540
she's still my little sister.

186
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,590
My precious little sister.

187
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,040
Shiga, this is going to be a huge deal.

188
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,480
If I can't make it back alive,

189
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,240
then...

190
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,660
I know, bro.

191
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:26,020
I, Shiga, will watch over Mio-san's future until the end.

192
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,570
I'm sorry, Shiga.

193
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,960
I got shot in the stomach and shoulder, huh?

194
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,130
This is no big deal.

195
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,790
I've survived after catching at least twice as many bullets.

196
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:51,550
The Asura realm is my way.

197
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,020
Yo.

198
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,490
Who's left?

199
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,610
They're all dead.

200
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:24,800
Really? So in the end,
the only ones left are you and me again.

201
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,630
It's always like this.

202
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:34,130
Regardless of what hell it is,
you're always there to rush in with me.

203
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:38,640
With my courage and your intelligence, no matter when...

204
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,180
What's wrong?

205
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,440
Nothing much.

206
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,900
So what about Claudia?

207
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:56,030
Inferno is going to finish that woman off.

208
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,480
Forget that. The problem is with us, the Godoh Group.

209
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,740
Inferno won't let us, the group that was under that woman, go so easily.

210
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,420
War is about to begin.

211
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,710
Inferno, so what?

212
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:15,880
They tricked us, so it's payback time.

213
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:23,010
We need to teach them a lesson, right Shiga?

214
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,200
We'll kill them all!

215
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,320
There's no need for that.

216
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:40,200
As long as one person dies, everything will be settled.

217
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,950
Shiga...

218
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,650
I guess you won't believe me no matter what I say now.

219
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,840
Bro, I truly love you from the bottom of my heart.

220
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,840
Shiga...

221
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,550
Shiga!

222
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:20,480
Killing the traitors proves the Godoh Group's sincerity.

223
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:25,380
I'll help you out with joining Inferno.

224
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,670
Mr. Shiga, now the Godoh Group is safe.

225
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:40,050
Giuseppe, I can barely hold back my urge to shoot you.

226
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,060
Are you going to shoot me?

227
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,010
Seems like we'll get along well.

228
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:03,410
We can become good friends, Mr. Shiga.

229
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,720
Clau... Where are you, Clau?!

230
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,920
Where are you?! Where the hell are you?!

231
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:23,220
At least give me an excuse, Claudia McCunnen!

232
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,900
Run, Reiji.

233
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,360
Live on!

234
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,450
Any pursuers?

235
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,220
Cal...

236
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,650
Cal!

237
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,440
You're still not bored of it?

238
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,250
Of course not.

239
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,740
Do you like that song that much?

240
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,710
I do.

241
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,270
Because it was given to me by the person I love most.

242
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,150
I thought I had nothing...

243
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:23,060
What normal people usually have, I don't.

244
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,870
That's why I thought I'd never be able to get it.

245
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,710
Thanks, Reiji.

246
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:42,370
I want to stay by your side forever.

247
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,130
Cal...

248
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:41,900
Cal...

249
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,210
CAL!!

250
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:28,210
If this world isn't an endless hell...

251
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:32,290
...it must be because you're here alive.
