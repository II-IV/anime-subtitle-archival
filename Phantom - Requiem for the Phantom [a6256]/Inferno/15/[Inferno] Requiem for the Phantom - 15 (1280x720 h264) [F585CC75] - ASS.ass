Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.80,0:07:20.29,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Don't you think sniping from a high place is annoying?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.41,0:07:22.31,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Why?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.15,0:07:30.11,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,When you shoot, it feels annoying when your angle of depression is too big.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.89,0:07:43.98,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,That means we can kind of exclude places that are too high.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.98,0:07:46.75,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,The spot must be on the same level as the target,
