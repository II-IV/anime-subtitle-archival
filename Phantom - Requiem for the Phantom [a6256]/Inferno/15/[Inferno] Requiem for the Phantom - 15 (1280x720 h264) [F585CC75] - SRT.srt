1
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,450
That's impossible...

2
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,860
She's dead.

3
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,450
I killed her.

4
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,880
But yet, I still...

5
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,510
...hope she's alive,

6
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,980
so that I can be forgiven.

7
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,380
Elen...

8
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,840
Tell me what's going on.

9
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:09,980
Four from the trade last time, and one from today.

10
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,560
Muroto, the one who was killed today,

11
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,950
was a man who I have known since his youth.

12
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,010
So what the hell happened?

13
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,950
Depending on the answer...

14
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,490
Shiga, you're allowed to fire.

15
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,520
Lizzie.

16
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,570
Please calm down and think about it, Mr. Godoh.

17
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,880
If we start a quarrel here,

18
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,440
it'll only make the murderer who killed Mr. Muroto happy.

19
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,360
Didn't you order it?

20
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,640
I don't mind if you suspect me.

21
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,600
But if you're going to shoot, please be prepared for the consequences.

22
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,770
Claudia...

23
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:58,320
You probably have another way out of this instead of us killing each other.

24
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,720
If we let this slip for now and you follow my instructions...

25
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,370
I'll find the person behind it in three days and hand him over to you.

26
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,770
Then let me have a look at the way Inferno compensates.

27
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,720
Counter-snipe?

28
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,070
Yes.

29
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:23,940
You're kidding.

30
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,830
In two days, the Godoh Group will be invited to Inferno's executive meeting.

31
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,480
And with that, they'll be officially affiliated.

32
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,070
After being affiliated, even Wisemel won't be able to lay a hand on them.

33
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,570
To them, this is their final chance.

34
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,490
As I thought, you're still suspecting Wisemel.

35
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,920
Regarding the attack last time and the murder of Muroto,

36
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,040
he's the only person that would benefit from them.

37
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,360
The place is the 5th floor of the Atrium Hotel.

38
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,450
It's a conference room with one wall of glass.

39
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,940
Displaying the prey on the showcase, huh?

40
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,300
And you'll ambush that place.

41
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,010
Even now, you still want to use the Godoh Group as bait?

42
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,600
If this succeeds, everything will be fine.

43
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,900
Of course, this is a dangerous gamble that won't succeed without you,

44
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,980
Phantom.

45
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,780
Oh, he's back!

46
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,160
Welcome home.

47
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,160
I'm back.

48
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,410
Wait a bit, I'll go warm up the soup.

49
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,850
Cal.

50
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,310
I found it when I was cleaning.

51
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,370
Did you disassemble it?

52
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,350
Sorry, I'll put it back together right away.

53
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,410
Are you good with machinery?

54
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,440
I usually have fun by disassembling whatever I have my hands on.

55
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,170
I just want to know how it works.

56
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,160
All right, done!

57
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,380
Put it back where you found it.

58
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:27,840
Okay.

59
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,790
Work?

60
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,170
Yeah, come and give me some ideas.

61
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,980
Okay! Okay!

62
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,250
What is it?

63
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,890
The target's on the 5th floor of this building.

64
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,610
If someone were to snipe the target from here...

65
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,830
You're shooting?

66
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,440
No, not me, it's another sniper.

67
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,830
I'm just predicting where that sniper will shoot from.

68
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,440
It can't be just anywhere.

69
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,000
The sniping spot must fulfill some conditions.

70
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,880
Conditions?

71
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,810
The spot must be of a certain height,

72
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,510
and it mustnâ€™t attract attention.

73
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,990
You mean like the roof of a building?

74
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,150
Yeah.

75
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,940
Then what about here?

76
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,790
No, that's too close.

77
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,010
There's no point in sniping if they're going to get discovered.

78
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,020
The spot must be at least 400 yards away.

79
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,600
400 yards? Can you even hit at such a distance?

80
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,510
If you have the right equipment and skill,

81
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,360
you can even hit up to 800 yards.

82
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:41,330
But that makes the number of buildings too big to pick a specific one...

83
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,880
Yeah, there are too many places.

84
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,500
This is your homework before bed.

85
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,880
Let's have dinner first.

86
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,390
How's that going?

87
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,810
Everything's ready.

88
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,400
Just leave it to me.

89
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,370
Don't fail.

90
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,900
If you do, your balls will be cut off.

91
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,400
Yes, sir.

92
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,410
What's wrong?

93
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,110
Hey, Reiji...

94
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,290
Don't you think sniping from a high place is annoying?

95
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,310
Why?

96
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:30,110
When you shoot, it feels annoying when your angle of depression is too big.

97
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,010
Did I say something strange?

98
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,220
No, you didn't.

99
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,890
Sniping like that really is difficult.

100
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:43,980
That means we can kind of exclude places that are too high.

101
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,750
The spot must be on the same level as the target,

102
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,190
and hopefully with a clear shot.

103
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,320
If we consider that, there might be fewer spots than we thought.

104
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,940
Good answer.

105
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,080
Was I right?

106
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,550
What you said was correct.

107
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,040
Yay!

108
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,690
What we need to do now is to look for it tomorrow.

109
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,840
Come with me.

110
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,380
I can?

111
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,520
I'm going out with you?

112
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,880
This isn't for fun.

113
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,460
Okay.

114
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,990
Excuse me.

115
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,780
Muroto's body was sent back to Japan on the last flight.

116
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,020
At the same time, Tsuzuki and Kakinuma are bringing more men here.

117
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,070
What about their guns?

118
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,260
Giuseppe is preparing them.

119
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,840
They'll probably be ready tomorrow...

120
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,610
That German?

121
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,040
Gifted Scotch again?

122
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,540
Yeah, have a drink too.

123
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,830
I'll help myself.

124
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,210
Damn that Muroto...

125
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,890
How could he leave so much to drink?

126
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,670
Not just him. There were Hamura and Shinjou too.

127
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:06,360
Five of my men died in a foreign country...

128
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,510
Hundreds of millions are involved.

129
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,900
It's only natural that it turned into a war.

130
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,480
They'd understand, too.

131
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,900
Like I said...

132
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:22,410
I'm mad at myself because I didn't even provide Muroto with a single pistol in this situation.

133
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,230
I'm definitely going to make Inferno settle this.

134
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,760
About that, I suspect that that Claudia woman is behind it.

135
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,130
Tell me about that.

136
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:41,630
We know the tricks that she has been using.

137
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:46,430
When her goal is complete, she'll probably want to abandon us, right?

138
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:53,360
Shiga, regarding this event, that woman is innocent.

139
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,590
Do you have proof?

140
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,610
Proof, huh?

141
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,410
Shiga, what's the tattoo I have on my back?

142
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,910
A five-colored jewel and an ascending dragon.

143
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,870
The dragon on my back is roaring.

144
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,130
That woman has the same dragon on her back.

145
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,530
She lives with the same spirit as me.

146
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,580
Holding a jewel and ascending toward heaven.

147
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,690
She's that type of dragon.

148
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,140
Only people of the same type would understand.

149
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,920
Just leave it to that woman for now.

150
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,980
This isn't something that can be explained with words.

151
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,620
Shiga, I count on your intelligence a lot.

152
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,990
So in return, believe in my instincts.

153
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,790
If that's what you say...

154
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,710
I'll just protect you from behind.

155
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,590
You're finally here.

156
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,410
All right, so what are you going to do, Inferno?

157
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,370
We're going.

158
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,690
Sorry, I'm coming right now.

159
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,590
It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance to be going out with you.

160
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:41,590
Let's go.

161
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,170
That's the target building.

162
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:56,180
We'll list the possibilities based on the conditions,

163
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,510
and after a thorough inspection, we'll pinpoint the spot.

164
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,760
How?

165
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,280
We'll look for weather vanes.

166
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,440
Weather vanes?

167
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,100
Even a professional would make preparations for a complicated sniping like this.

168
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,580
Especially in an area with so many buildings.

169
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,840
Wind.

170
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,920
Correct, strong wind will ruin the shot.

171
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,460
When shooting, the sniper must watch the wind direction.

172
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,460
But you can't see wind...

173
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,350
Oh, I get it!

174
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:37,360
Snipers will prepare weather vanes like this at different points.

175
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:42,860
Then we just need to find a spot with these pieces of cloth and flags sticking out unnaturally...

176
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,860
Correct.

177
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,000
Cal.

178
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,640
Sorry, no discoveries here.

179
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,900
Same here.

180
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,730
Then let's move on.

181
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,510
I think this is enough for today.

182
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,440
Wait, Reiji.

183
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,420
Something's not right here...

184
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,490
Not right?

185
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,320
That.

186
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,630
Nice, Cal.

187
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,540
Bingo?

188
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,420
Yeah.

189
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,730
There's no doubt that their sniping spot is over there.

190
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:49,650
Hey, so you're going to snipe that sniper from here?

191
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,450
Yeah.

192
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,330
Could that sniper be Judy's killer?

193
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,830
Probably.

194
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,930
At the very least, they're part of the same group.

195
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,670
Let me witness it...

196
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,090
Let me witness the moment you shoot!

197
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,810
Death isn't something you should see.

198
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,310
Judy...

199
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,790
was killed right before my eyes.

200
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:34,310
Normally, the ideal situation is to have two people on a sniping mission.

201
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,580
Because in that case, the sniper will have support.

202
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:49,010
Supporting the sniper by observing the target and surroundings with a different scope.

203
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,300
They call one who does that an observer,

204
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,090
someone who witnesses everything.

205
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,470
Can you do it?

206
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:58,640
Yeah!

207
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,350
Cal, give me your hand.

208
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:04,890
Yes?

209
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,470
Your reward for today.

210
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,220
This is...

211
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,120
Thanks, Reiji!

212
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,410
I'll treat it with care.

213
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,230
I'll treat it with a lot of care...

214
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,170
...forever.

215
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:55,180
The enemy's over there and the sun is behind us.

216
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,820
They won't be able to see us because of the backlight.

217
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,520
Correct.

218
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,640
Clau, Wisemel's here.

219
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,460
I see.

220
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,360
But Randy Weber isn't here.

221
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:32,250
It's weird for him not to bring his right-hand man at such an important meeting.

222
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,860
What's he plotting?

223
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,220
It's the promised day.

224
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,200
I'm looking forward to seeing how that woman is going to settle this.

225
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,630
A white outfit plus a gun.

226
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,210
There's nothing more suitable to wear for barging into hell.

227
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,800
Let's go, Shiga.

228
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,050
All right, I'll follow you no matter where you go.

229
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,940
There's no one there, Reiji.

230
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,720
Could it be that the spot is somewhere else?

231
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,770
Calm down, there's still time left.

232
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,920
Welcome to Inferno.

233
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:40,010
There! Someone's there behind the water tower!

234
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,710
Target confirmed.

235
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,880
Can you see the person's face from where you are?

236
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,730
It's hidden, so I can't see...

237
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,520
I can't even tell if it's a man or a woman...

238
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,350
This is bad, Reiji!

239
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,990
That person is about to shoot! Hurry!

240
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,080
No,

241
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,990
it can't be her.

242
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,750
Reiji?

243
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,470
She's already dead...

244
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,130
I killed her...

245
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,670
Elen was...

246
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,880
Reiji?! Shoot!

247
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:25,490
Show me that face of yours!

248
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,550
Reiji?!

249
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,400
There he goes!

250
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,240
Reiji!

251
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,580
Did you get shot? Did you hit him?

252
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,590
No, it just scratched me.

253
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,470
Reiji, you idiot...

254
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,050
Why did you do that?

255
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,680
I had to see that person's face no matter what.

256
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,370
Idiot...

257
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,320
Good job, observer.

258
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,590
He's the one who killed Judy.

259
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,550
You've avenged her.

260
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:31,690
Now, the mastermind behind this is confirmed.

261
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,000
All that's left is...

262
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,770
You bastards...

263
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,500
What? What happened?

264
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,700
There's another sniper...

265
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,490
Don't tell me...

266
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,500
No way...

267
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,800
Mission completed.

268
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,200
No way...

269
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,650
Yes, Master.

270
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,670
I don't want to be separated.

271
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,870
I want to be together forever.

272
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,800
I want to help Reiji.

273
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,260
I want him to need me.
