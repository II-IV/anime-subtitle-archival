1
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,920
Don't drink too much even if your customer asks you to...

2
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,450
I'm always the one picking you up.

3
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,780
Anyway, thank you.

4
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,870
I'm glad I have such a capable sister.

5
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,170
Jeez...

6
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,780
Judy!

7
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,250
Judy!

8
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,120
Why...

9
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,950
Why?!

10
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,660
Is this where Judy Devens passed away?

11
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,660
Who are you?

12
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,860
Everyone called you Phantom, right?

13
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,800
I heard about it from Judy's friends.

14
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,710
You're the one that kills people in American gangs.

15
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,670
So you're a true assassin, right?

16
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,150
You're an assassin, right?

17
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,670
The assassin, Phantom.

18
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,640
Yeah, that's right.

19
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:32,900
Cal?

20
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,040
Please! Kill them all!

21
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,470
The guys who were at the alley last night, the guys who shot,

22
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,410
and the guys who were supposed to retrieve the money.

23
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,030
Kill all the people who caused Judy's death...

24
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,190
Can you do it?

25
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,450
Judy...

26
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,980
I met Phantom.

27
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,510
Reiji will definitely avenge you...

28
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,490
With that five million...

29
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:28,660
Cal.

30
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,550
Let me make it clear.

31
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,950
Five million isn't enough.

32
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,520
Really?

33
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,110
But you only need a little more.

34
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,210
You could make it even by yourself.

35
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,860
What should I do?

36
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,820
Become my assistant in the meantime.

37
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:50,640
Wow!

38
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,050
Hey, so if I become your assistant,

39
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,570
I'll be able to see the moment when Judy gets avenged with my own eyes, right?

40
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,990
Before that, there's something you need to get.

41
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,500
Have you decided yet?

42
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,620
Hold on.

43
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,630
Just pick the one you want the most.

44
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:28,140
But I want all the clothes here equally.

45
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,310
If I just picked one, I'd have to give up the others, right?

46
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,100
Don't worry.

47
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,580
This isn't the only chance that you'll get to shop.

48
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,180
I'll bring you here again if there's something else you want.

49
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:45,860
Really?

50
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:50,460
Yeah, so pick a set of clothes you want to wear today.

51
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,370
Then...

52
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,160
Hey, hey, is it cute?

53
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,870
Does it look good on me?

54
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,380
Yeah, it looks really good on you.

55
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,390
This is my first time wearing such light clothes!

56
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,680
Give me a second, okay?

57
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,140
I'll cook after I'm done here.

58
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,060
Why are you cleaning?

59
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,570
Because it's really dirty.

60
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,940
There's no helping it.

61
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,780
An assassin who cleans his own house doesn't sound too tough.

62
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,950
Just leave something like this to your assistant.

63
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,600
All right, thanks.

64
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:45,300
I'll do my best to earn that money on top of the five million.

65
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,310
Hey Reiji, do you have any family?

66
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,920
Family?

67
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,700
They're in heaven.

68
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,800
Really?

69
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,750
Yeah.

70
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,580
Just like me.

71
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,570
Are your parents already...

72
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,100
I have no idea.

73
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,410
I ran away from my bastard old man,

74
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,210
and then Judy took me in.

75
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,770
If she hadn't, I'd be dead already.

76
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,250
So that's why you're siblings?

77
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,470
Yup, she's my only family.

78
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,990
But Judy died...

79
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,720
Sorry.

80
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,140
It's all right.

81
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,150
What am I to do now that Judy's dead?

82
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,280
Where should I go?

83
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,880
What should I do?

84
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,150
I don't have any idea.

85
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,830
I was like you once,

86
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,370
not knowing what to do.

87
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,120
There are many ways to die.

88
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,890
Cal.

89
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,790
Cal, give me your hand.

90
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,180
Yes?

91
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,710
Your reward for today.

92
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,420
This is...

93
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,540
Thanks, Reiji!

94
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,660
I'll treat it with care.

95
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,430
I'll treat it with a lot of care...

96
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,590
...forever.

97
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,520
All the actors have gathered.

98
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,510
Claudia, the woman who used me through crafty tricks,

99
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:08,230
and now wants to create another scheme.

100
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:13,440
Godoh Daisuke, her partner who wants to make inroads into Inferno along with her.

101
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:19,480
Wisemel, the one who discovered the conspiracy and is trying to stop it.

102
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,960
And there's another new actor.

103
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,320
Let me create the best stage.

104
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:31,470
Now, it's time to get busy.

105
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,060
Ein.

106
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,530
Could that sniper be Judy's killer?

107
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,040
Probably.

108
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,390
At the very least, they're part of the same group.

109
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,880
Let me witness it...

110
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,260
There! Someone's there behind the water tower!

111
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,740
Show me that face of yours!

112
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,900
Reiji?!

113
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,680
You bastards...

114
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,980
You can't, Mr. Godoh!

115
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,560
You scared me...

116
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,900
I...

117
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,130
I...

118
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,570
Want to...

119
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,170
Reiji!

120
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,180
Did you get shot? Did you hit him?

121
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,180
No, it just scratched me.

122
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,520
Reiji, you idiot...

123
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,150
Why did you do that?

124
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,690
I had to see that person's face no matter what.

125
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,420
Idiot...

126
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,370
Good job, observer.

127
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,610
He's the one who killed Judy.

128
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,540
You've avenged her.

129
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,760
Mission completed.

130
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:31,780
Very well. Withdraw via route C immediately,

131
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,310
and wait for instructions.

132
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,280
Yes,

133
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,870
Master.

134
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,930
Hey, I heard some rumors.

135
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,660
Is it true that Issac of the Bloodies died?

136
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,410
Yes, it is.

137
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:01,500
Then avenging Judy is done...

138
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,010
I see.

139
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,390
Hey, so how was it?

140
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,940
How was my assassin training?

141
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,020
If it's fine with you, I can help you with your assassinations from now on.

142
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,830
No more assassinations.

143
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,280
No more...

144
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,580
Then does that mean...

145
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,370
I'm fired?

146
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,760
However...

147
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,290
I wouldn't want to miss your cooking.

148
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,450
For the time being, I'll let you be my kitchen maid.

149
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,400
Really?! Yay! Maid!

150
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,450
I've always wanted to try that!

151
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,680
Maid clothes are really cute, aren't they?!

152
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,780
Reiji.

153
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,010
What's up?

154
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,610
You know,

155
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,120
I really want to become your assistant.

156
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,710
Cal, that's...

157
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:27,420
I know that you don't want me to become an assassin.

158
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,850
Because you know the pain of an assassin.

159
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:38,710
Cal, you can walk whatever path you want. Do whatever you want...

160
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,120
But why do you want to become an assassin?

161
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,360
Do you hate assassins?

162
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,150
Yeah.

163
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,110
Does that mean you hate yourself too?

164
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,970
Yeah, I do.

165
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,210
Killing is like my second nature and I can't go back.

166
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,490
That's why I hate myself.

167
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,250
But Reiji...

168
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,210
I'm already broken.

169
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,380
Do you want to become like me?!

170
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,740
Sorry Reiji... I...

171
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,480
Cal, I said too much.

172
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,250
Sorry.

173
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,440
But it's true.

174
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,670
I don't know how many have died because of me.

175
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,180
If I weren't there, they would still be living.

176
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,540
They could have all gone back to their families and lovers.

177
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,650
It's not your fault.

178
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:53,550
You just accepted a job that was going to be done either way.

179
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,360
It's not as pretty as you described...

180
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,090
Then, do you really want to kill?

181
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,950
Do you shoot just because you want to kill?

182
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,930
Do you like to kill?

183
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,740
You don't, right?

184
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,130
But Cal...

185
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,970
When you kill your first person, the whole world changes.

186
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:25,500
Everything you see... Everything you hear... Everything changes.

187
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,680
You won't be your kind self anymore.

188
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,220
I don't want you to become like that.

189
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,720
This isn't where you belong.

190
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,810
You shouldn't come into the world that I'm in.

191
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:43,980
But...

192
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,790
But you'll always stay in there, right?

193
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,640
If I go there, then I'll always be able to stay with you.

194
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,490
Cal...

195
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,610
I don't want to leave you...

196
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,260
I want to stay by your side forever.

197
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,500
I want to help you.

198
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,680
I just...

199
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,050
...want to be with you.

200
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:18,070
I get it now. I...

201
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,560
...really do want to go back.

202
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,930
By doing that,

203
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,570
I can stay with you.

204
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,790
There's no need. I'll go to your world.

205
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,980
I'll go to where you are.

206
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,500
Let me go... Let me go back...

207
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,840
Back to the world where you are.

208
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:58,720
Reiji said he'll stay by my side...

209
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,120
There's no...

210
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,570
There's no mistake to that!

211
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,170
I can't believe you've got work this late.

212
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,730
This might take a while.

213
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,930
You can go to bed.

214
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,300
No, I'll stay up.

215
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,840
I picked up a broken video cassette recorder during the day.

216
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,150
I want to try to fix it.

217
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,520
Just buy a new one.

218
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,780
That's such a waste.

219
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,340
Maybe it can still be used.

220
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,330
It can still be used, huh?

221
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,340
That's right.

222
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,590
Come back soon.

223
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,000
Yeah.

224
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,940
Promise.

225
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,810
Yeah, I promise.

226
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,890
It's a promise!

227
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,300
Yay! I did it! I did it!

228
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,730
Hmm... I think the video store is still open.

229
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,230
Reiji! Reiji!

230
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,090
You can't go in!

231
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:39,740
It's dangerous!

232
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,740
But Reiji is... Reiji is...

233
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,820
Reiji!

234
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,100
Reiji...

235
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,410
You'll come back, right?

236
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,570
We promised...

237
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,420
Liar...

238
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,600
You said you wouldn't leave me...

239
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,690
You said you'd be with me...

240
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,320
Correct. He's a liar.

241
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,610
You've been deceived this whole time.

242
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,820
Who are...

243
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,330
...you?

244
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,670
At a time like this...

245
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,170
Just cry.

246
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,720
Right now,

247
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,840
you can be like your old self...
