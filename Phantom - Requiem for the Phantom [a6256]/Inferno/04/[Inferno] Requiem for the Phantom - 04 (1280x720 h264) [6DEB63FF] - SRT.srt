1
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,860
How do I look?

2
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,530
Yeah, looks good...

3
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,760
...I think.

4
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,860
Umm...

5
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,620
I'll pick something else.

6
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,140
Come on. Hurry up!

7
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,350
Time is limited, you know.

8
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,090
Yeah, I know.

9
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,920
Hey, it's this way! Are you even looking at the map?

10
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,180
I am!

11
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,030
Oh! I'm gonna go take a look in that store real quick!

12
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,810
All right.

13
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,560
Can I borrow your wallet?

14
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,050
Huh?

15
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,500
Sorry to keep you waiting!

16
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,290
Nice to meet you.

17
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,300
Are you going to carry that around with you?

18
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,670
Yup!

19
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,990
Come on, I know a good place around here.

20
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,760
Let's sit over there.

21
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,080
I'll pay for that.

22
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,080
Idiot.

23
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,580
You didn't have to order this much.

24
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,840
No, it was my fault after all.

25
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,330
Please help yourself.

26
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:40,800
Thanks.

27
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,910
Mm, this is good!

28
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,550
Are you two students?

29
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,010
Yeah, we are.

30
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,060
Today's a weekday.

31
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,060
Skipping school, eh?

32
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,170
It's the anniversary of our school's founding.

33
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,310
A school-sponsored party is boring, anyway.

34
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,820
Yeah, I used to skip those too.

35
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,890
See?

36
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,220
Sorry.

37
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,000
You have ice cream on your face.

38
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,090
You are so careless, Wallace.

39
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,090
Let's go.

40
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,310
Do you have a clear understanding of the mall structure now?

41
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,570
I crammed it into my head.

42
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,950
How many security cameras are on Main Street?

43
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,600
Sixty-eight.

44
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,020
There are a lot of blind spots, but they won't make our mission any easier.

45
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,220
Don't get involved with other people so thoughtlessly.

46
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,160
Sorry about that.

47
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,150
Let's go back to discuss the mission.

48
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,960
The luggage should be arriving right about now.

49
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,360
Roger.

50
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:11,900
Zwei.

51
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,650
Your acting...

52
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,980
...sucks.

53
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,800
Since we've obtained Zwei, Phantom has been able to perform missions more efficiently.

54
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,990
They're an ideal pairing.

55
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,780
They look like a bunch of useless brats,

56
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:37,330
but I'll praise them since they helped us advance into the east coast five months earlier than we planned.

57
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,500
The highest of honors.

58
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,530
However, don't you find it dangerous?

59
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,000
That we're continuously using Phantom like this.

60
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,140
I wholeheartedly agree with you.

61
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:50,070
I believe that the wise thing to do would be to carefully postpone the plan.

62
00:06:50,550 --> 00:07:00,020
This may be rude of me, but if you trust me and Phantom, I'd like you to allow the plan to be carried out.

63
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,690
To be absolutely sure, I will head to the site myself.

64
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,810
Oh? You're pretty fired up, aren't you?

65
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,250
Very well.

66
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,030
I'll leave it to your Phantom.

67
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,650
I am eternally grateful.

68
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,760
The fake name that was given to me was Wallace Yang.

69
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,090
He's a student living in Los Angeles.

70
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,320
It's the same name as the first man I killed.

71
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,830
Ever since I killed him, I've been working all this time...

72
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,330
...the work of killing people...

73
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,510
...together with her.

74
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,880
I...

75
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,990
Don Lucio.

76
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,640
The boss of a Dallas mafia family.

77
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,090
He tries to stay inside his mansion, which has strict security.

78
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,490
But there will be an exception in three days.

79
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,150
He'll go to that mall to buy a birthday present for his granddaughter.

80
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,720
That's...

81
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,540
This is for us.

82
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,810
The target arrives at the scene around three o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

83
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,750
We'll take up positions in the ideal locations before that.

84
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,050
Where do you think the ideal locations are?

85
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,550
You decide.

86
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,140
Another test?

87
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,640
That's what Master ordered.

88
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:05,020
We'll mingle with the shoppers and approach the target.

89
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,210
People won't suspect us.

90
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,270
But we can't shoot him inside the mall.

91
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:14,740
Why?

92
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,880
It's too wide open.

93
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,680
There'll probably be a lot of guards, too.

94
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,740
They've also gained control of the security cameras.

95
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:27,500
We should attack him somewhere inconspicuous and with fewer guards.

96
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,500
And where would that be?

97
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,750
There's only one answer.

98
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,010
The moment the target and his guards relax...

99
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,610
That's...

100
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,360
That's enough.

101
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,080
That's the right answer.

102
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,160
Let's go back now.

103
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,080
Yeah.

104
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,620
What's up?

105
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,680
I've confirmed the target. But I've been marked.

106
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,210
There are two tracers on me. Help me fool them.

107
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,650
Come to the fountain in front of the elevator. Quickly.

108
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,260
How long do you think I've waited?!

109
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,790
Geez! I've already gone and looked around by myself!

110
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:22,670
Sorry...

111
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,470
I don't want to hear your excuses.

112
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,680
So, how are you going to make up for wasting my time today?

113
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,190
Well...

114
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,050
Depending on your answer, I might be going home.

115
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,440
Fine, fine. I'll carry everything you buy today.

116
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,820
Will you pay for dinner, too?

117
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,710
Sure.

118
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,800
I've already found all the stores.

119
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,340
You saved me the trouble.

120
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,450
It's your fault, Wallace.

121
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,360
I said sorry, didn't I?

122
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,410
The target is at an antique store in the south mall.

123
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,300
His car will be sent to the south exit to pick him up.

124
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,300
Are we going to proceed?

125
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,190
Thank you very much.

126
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,850
I think this one looks good on you.

127
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,790
Are you ready?

128
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,860
Yeah.

129
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,830
I'll attack, so cover me.

130
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:41,800
Roger that.

131
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,430
The moment the target and his guards relax...

132
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,320
Now we bring this to an end.

133
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,480
Well done, you two.

134
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,740
What is it?

135
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,240
Nothing.

136
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,140
What is it?

137
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,350
No, nothing.

138
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,040
Nothing...

139
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,200
I'm honored that you went through the trouble to come and greet me.

140
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,530
It's natural for a superior to show her appreciation to her subordinate.

141
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,770
You did a good job. I appreciate it.

142
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,040
Not at all.

143
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,590
That boy transformed, didn't he?

144
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,800
Are you satisfied?

145
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,550
Yeah, I guess...

146
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,550
Is something the matter?

147
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,700
No.

148
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,140
Where are those two?

149
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,900
I'll have them return via a passenger flight after taking care of the equipment.

150
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,570
Are you interested?

151
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,770
Not really.

152
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:40,910
I see...

153
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,540
Maybe she's tired from waiting?

154
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,940
Oh, you're the person from yesterday...

155
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:54,960
Taking a trip?

156
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,500
We took a trip here. Now we're heading back.

157
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,760
I see. Did you have a good trip?

158
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,890
Yes... it was great.

159
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,670
Good. It'd be nice if we could see each other again.

160
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,090
Well then!

161
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,700
Bye.

162
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,610
That was...

163
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,870
...good acting.

164
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,340
Two dogs in a doghouse, just waiting to be given a task...

165
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,520
That's... what we are now.

166
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,250
And... again...

167
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,190
Something wrong?

168
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,910
Nothing.

169
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,290
Don't worry about it.

170
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,530
What Master said was right.

171
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:48,680
Within three months, he ran through the path that took me two years.

172
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:12,870
He is... who I used to be...

173
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,730
He is... another me...

174
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,420
I'm afraid...

175
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,230
...of the truth...

176
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,620
...I might see who I really am...

177
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,120
Your eyes...

178
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:40,940
...scare me...

179
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,050
We get rid of our emotions and pull the trigger.

180
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:33,150
We take others' happiness away.
