1
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,910
It's the first time I've ever worn something this light and cool!

2
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,050
Cal...

3
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:31,420
This concludes all of Claudia McCunnen's conspiracies.

4
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,860
She trapped me in order to take away my command.

5
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,470
Then she used Zwei, who eventually became Phantom, as a toy...

6
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,110
...and eliminated Wisemel's power.

7
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,330
Her modus operandi is something to be praised.

8
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,300
We received a call from Lizzie Garland.

9
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,430
Claudia McCunnen has gone into hiding.

10
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,690
It seems like she doesn't plan to give us excuses.

11
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,800
Even though it is unbelievable, Scythe Master,

12
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,580
you can think of it as a corroboration for your story.

13
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,320
According to your suggestion,

14
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,040
we must retain the cooperative route with the Godoh Group, which sided with Claudia.

15
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,650
Yes.

16
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,550
Last year's cocaine robbery was surely a painful memory for Inferno.

17
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,100
However...

18
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,660
The profit from the Far Eastern market which the Godoh Group makes...

19
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,610
...is infinitely higher than the sustained losses.

20
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,600
Plus, if you apply the "emotional theory,"

21
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:32,350
I hope you will be much more considerate when it comes to Mr. Shiga's decision...

22
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,220
...to purge Godoh Daisuke as soon as the truth was revealed.

23
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,100
I see.

24
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,390
This is certainly a logical suggestion.

25
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,360
However...

26
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:49,340
Of course, the profit that the Godoh Group demands this time will be reduced as a penalty.

27
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,090
I hope you don't mind.

28
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,190
Very well.

29
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,330
Mr. Shiga,

30
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:03,590
for agitating your men, I assure a most cruel end to Claudia McCunnen.

31
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,300
Thank you, Mr. McGuire.

32
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,210
We are investigating Claudia's whereabouts,

33
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,010
but Phantom is the real problem.

34
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,100
We don't know what he'll do.

35
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,450
If you don't mind, Mr. McGuire,

36
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:24,610
may I send out Ein to track him down?

37
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,950
A duel between the old and the new Phantom, eh?

38
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,870
Interesting...

39
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,490
You want to work under the Bloodies?

40
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,820
Don't joke around!

41
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,400
Isaac was the one who killed Romero!

42
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,800
A new, strong organization is backing the Bloodies now.

43
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,380
So what?

44
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,390
One day, Inferno's time will come.

45
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,600
You...

46
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,770
Do you want to climb up the ranks that much?

47
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,240
Even by working under your little brother's murderer?

48
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,990
I'll reach where Romero couldn't.

49
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,490
I believe that's the best way to pay my respects to him.

50
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,540
At this point, I don't want to give up.

51
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,020
Come with me, Lizzie Garland.

52
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,020
I need you.

53
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,870
Even though I am part of the Mafia,

54
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,010
I have no intention of becoming a human slave.

55
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:22,590
There's a righteousness which is above simple loss and profit.

56
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,490
If you promise not to violate this, then...

57
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,740
Very well, Clau.

58
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,350
I'll follow you.

59
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,360
I promise.

60
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,330
You stupid moron.

61
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,320
To go on ahead like that.

62
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,330
You're such a complete imbecile.

63
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,380
It's no good! Nothing is coming out of this!

64
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,360
Fuck.

65
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,200
Call Ms. Lizzie!

66
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,830
There's nothing here.

67
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,450
I found it.

68
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,340
Her car key.

69
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,880
The more I look at it, the more awesome it is!

70
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,300
I'd love to ride the car owner as well.

71
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,900
No doubt.

72
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,920
Reiji.

73
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,790
Thank goodness.

74
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,030
It seems like you're all right.

75
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,180
I hope you at least have a gist of what's going on.

76
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,940
Claudia...

77
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,720
You...

78
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,610
I have no excuses.

79
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,220
I simply did what I had to do
in order to survive in the organization.

80
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,880
I've been deceiving you as well.

81
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,400
I don't plan on giving up just yet.

82
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,000
I can still win.

83
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,900
Reiji,

84
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,240
with you...

85
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,740
I'm going to escape from L.A. and join the East Coast Organization.

86
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,820
But in order to protect myself from Inferno's agents,

87
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,310
I need your help.

88
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,980
I'll wait for you at the 39th Drive Inn.

89
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,460
This time, I'll put my life in your hands.

90
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,180
Cal...

91
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,600
Scars like that can be removed at any time.

92
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:53,080
But I intentionally did nothing.

93
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,550
Do you know why?

94
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,060
Yes, Master.

95
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,510
What does that scar symbolize?

96
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,600
Insult and downfall.

97
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,110
That is correct.

98
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,390
Ein.

99
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,670
In the past, you were my best achievement.

100
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,590
But you were soiled by that man twice.

101
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,320
Your current self is far from perfection.

102
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,220
You're just like garbage.

103
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,550
But still...

104
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,850
I am right beside garbage like you.

105
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:28,960
This is because I believe that the time for renewal will come someday.

106
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,690
Kill Zwei.

107
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,550
Cleanse your disgrace with your own hands.

108
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,910
Reclaim yourself and recover that light that was within you.

109
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,140
Then I shall remove that scar from you.

110
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,310
I shall love you as my creation once more.

111
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,940
Thank you, Master.

112
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,490
Can Ein win against Azuma Reiji?

113
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,740
In the worst-case scenario,

114
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,510
she'll sacrifice herself in order to kill Zwei.

115
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,730
Sacrificing her own life...

116
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,980
You're just going to use her and then throw her away?

117
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,290
Thanks to an excellent creation known as Ein,

118
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,580
my art is about to reach a new level.

119
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:30,090
Even though she is the first full creation that is worth celebrating,

120
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,930
I don't put that much worth into souvenirs.

121
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,890
But this is the final stage.

122
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,430
There must have been a better method.

123
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:50,140
Sometimes, actors overact in plays
and the brush moves to an unexpected location.

124
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:56,010
It's the Muse's prank which surprises both the artist and the audience.

125
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,410
Will the final stage be a tragedy?

126
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,910
Or will it be a happy ending?

127
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,830
To leave the finale's joy to fate.

128
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,690
Isn't that something to be thrilled about?

129
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:28,640
Would her disposal be too much for you to handle, Lizzie Garland?

130
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,700
Don't underestimate me!

131
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,380
Who the hell do you think I am?

132
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,570
You and Claudia are old friends.

133
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,630
Due to your feelings, you might have difficulties pulling the trigger.

134
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,800
Shut the fuck up, you bastard!

135
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,800
A man who has no sense of time will become hated, Reiji.

136
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,330
This is where it all began.

137
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,320
Zwei.

138
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,800
I am...

139
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,690
I am...

140
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,710
...not Zwei!

141
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,490
I...

142
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,420
I...

143
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,360
What was I doing until now...?

144
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,330
I've always wanted to race just like this.

145
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,820
Driving at an uncatchable speed, leaving everything behind.

146
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,010
You might end up flying to the sky.

147
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,760
That would be wonderful.

148
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,650
That's true freedom.

149
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:36,190
Where were you planning to go with all that?

150
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,000
I have no goal.

151
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,940
I just go wherever I can.

152
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,770
That's stupid.

153
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,470
One day, you'll just get tired and stop.

154
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,780
At that point, what will you do when you don't have your legs on the ground anymore?

155
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:54,000
There are stones which can't be left unturned.

156
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,760
That's true...

157
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,650
But it's okay.

158
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:02,010
Some scenes can only be seen when you race at this speed.

159
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,980
I just wanted to chase that to the end.

160
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,230
Till the very end...

161
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,030
Idiot...

162
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,440
...I'm sorry.

163
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,240
Do you want to die like this? Without doing anything?

164
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,420
If you're my opponent, then I'm like a rat in a trap.

165
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,630
That's a problem.

166
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,300
I was told to win in a proper fight.

167
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,050
Only the best shall survive.

168
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,550
To prove worthy of being a true Phantom.

169
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:13,740
I see.

170
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,530
If that's the case, then I'll play with you.

171
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,850
Strong...

172
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,930
Even now,

173
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,310
you are given reasons to fight this badly...

174
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,790
...by that Scythe.

175
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:50,970
Elen...

176
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,670
Why?

177
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,790
I can't win.

178
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,950
I don't want to win either.

179
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,870
I'm tired of this.

180
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,810
To kill you, and run away from this place...

181
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:22,980
Then what?

182
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,730
What would change?

183
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,050
To get deceived, played with,

184
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,900
and never be able to protect the one that you love.

185
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,030
There is no exit.

186
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,690
I hate this endless loop.

187
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,980
So please, finish me off this time.

188
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,270
With your hand.

189
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:42,890
That's right.

190
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,980
I won't blame you.

191
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,810
Nothing could have been done.

192
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,190
Even I can't endure this.

193
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:53,120
But you are still alive and can fight your way through.

194
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,550
Even now... for that Scythe.

195
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,170
No.

196
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,210
The reason I live is...

197
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:07,630
...this.

198
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,220
You told me to survive.

199
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,140
I swore to fight for my own will.

200
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,940
This is the scar that you made that time.

201
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,740
I admired you.

202
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,570
Even though it was just a short moment,

203
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,660
your strength that day...

204
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,700
...the proof of your oath that day...

205
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,040
...lives on in this body.

206
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,920
That's why I couldn't throw my life away.

207
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,310
That can't be...

208
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,280
You are another form of myself.

209
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,240
You fought through the path that I gave up myself.

210
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,780
You struggled and fought through.

211
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:08,580
That is why I lived dreaming about you,

212
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:13,150
believing that another me is living on freely somewhere.

213
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,180
This scar has always reminded me of that.

214
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,120
But I can no longer endure this pain.

215
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,490
If you give up,

216
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,510
no one can blame you for it.

217
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,170
So please,

218
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,830
if you are going to break that day's oath...

219
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,470
...kill me first.

220
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,130
And end everything once and for all.

221
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,390
I can't do something like that.

222
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,570
Don't worry.

223
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,180
I am Master's failure.

224
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,170
I'm just a doll that's waiting to be disposed of.

225
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,150
Elen...

226
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,250
If this world wasn't a complete hell for for me,

227
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,860
that's because you were alive.

228
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,890
So please, kill me.

229
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:13,110
I don't want to live in a world without you.

230
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,210
Until now, I couldn't keep any promises.

231
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,150
I thought I had lost everything.

232
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,520
Reiji...

233
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:36,360
But if I still have a promise I must keep, I'd like to keep it.

234
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,530
This is definitely my last one.

235
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,700
I'll take you away from Scythe.

236
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:50,620
Looks like the ending wasn't so pleasing.

237
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,920
I wouldn't be too quick to judge.

238
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,750
Perhaps this was really just one act of the show.

239
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,060
Bro!

240
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,640
Thanks, Reiji.

241
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,440
I'll treasure it.

242
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,960
I'll treasure it...

243
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,320
...forever.

244
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,910
Cal.

245
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,720
Cal...

246
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,660
It seems like I can't go to where you are for a while.

247
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,840
I still have an unfinished job that I must do.

248
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,830
Reiji?

249
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:21,960
Let's go.

250
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,810
Liar.

251
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,820
You said that we wouldn't get separated.

252
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,050
You said that we would be together...
