1
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,700
How long do you plan on sleeping?

2
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,920
School's already over.

3
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,510
What is it?

4
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,940
You could've woken me up some other way.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,920
What?

6
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,010
Actually...

7
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,430
I want to discuss something with you.

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,210
Is that the sort of attitude you should have when you're asking for something?

9
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,600
So what?!

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,790
It's something that you'll benefit from anyway.

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,190
Why do you look so skeptical?

12
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,400
Tell me about it.

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,190
Before I do, I want you to come to the roof.

14
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,320
Why did you bring me here?

15
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,500
So what is it?

16
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,840
Just come along.

17
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,560
Umm...

18
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,190
If I remember correctly, you're from the class next to ours...

19
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,470
Umm, Sanae...

20
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,920
On second thought, I...

21
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,250
Can't hear you! Can't hear you!

22
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,950
Well, see you later.

23
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:07,440
You're Elen's friend, right?

24
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,550
Fujiwara-san, was it?

25
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,270
It's Fujieda.

26
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,290
I'm Fujieda Mio.

27
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,470
So you know Sanae.

28
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,880
Yes, umm...

29
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,050
We were in the same class during freshman year.

30
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,480
Oh...

31
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,150
By the way, did you want something from me?

32
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,750
Actually... I just wanted to ask you something.

33
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,270
Is it something about Elen?

34
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,150
No, it isn't...

35
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,670
Umm...

36
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,770
What I want to ask about is you.

37
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,010
Reiji-san, do you...

38
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,780
Do you have anyone you like right now?

39
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,140
But I guess it wouldn't be someone like me.

40
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,420
That means...

41
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,210
No... Umm...

42
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,040
Mio?

43
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:55,900
Elen!

44
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,660
Brother, what are you...

45
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,090
...doing here?

46
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,500
I was wondering who you were talking to.

47
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,710
You know Mio?

48
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,530
No...

49
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,100
Why are you here?

50
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,140
I was looking for Mio.

51
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,480
I suddenly wanted to eat Kanekoya's waffles,

52
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,540
so I wanted to ask Mio if she'd tag along.

53
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,990
Hey, wanna go?

54
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,460
I have something to do today...

55
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,290
Bye!

56
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,830
Did I intrude on something?

57
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,120
You barged right in.

58
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,520
Did something happen?

59
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,400
She was confessing to me...

60
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,140
Huh?

61
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,330
Like I said, Fujiwara-san was about to.

62
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,020
It's Fujieda.

63
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,410
Wait, seriously?

64
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,960
Mio confessed to you?

65
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,550
Yeah, I guess...

66
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,610
Mio's taste is odd.

67
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,470
What's that supposed to mean?

68
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,270
So how did you reply to her?

69
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,800
You barged in before I could, then-

70
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,600
Go after her!

71
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,720
I think Mio would really want to hear a reply.

72
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,970
This might sound weird coming from the one who barged in...

73
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,230
...but you can't just ignore her!

74
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,190
But I don't know how I should...

75
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,070
Think about that yourself.

76
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:07,770
Like I said...

77
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,820
Just go!

78
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,750
Jeez, I went all the way to set it up for you.

79
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,450
Why don't you just get to the main points?

80
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,260
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,260
You should've just followed the game plan.

82
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,490
"I like you, so be my boyfriend."

83
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,600
Like that.

84
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,930
Then just strangle him until he agrees.

85
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,790
It won't take longer than five seconds.

86
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,140
Confessing is a blitzkrieg!

87
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,020
What's there to think about?

88
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,780
But, I...

89
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,590
I don't think I can do it!

90
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,920
Oh, goddammit!

91
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,300
This is the final spring of your school life!

92
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,610
Do you plan on wasting it?

93
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,510
Sanae.

94
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,200
Great timing!

95
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,840
We were planning to look for you after this.

96
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,440
Thank goodness I found you guys.

97
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,410
I have something to say to Fujieda-san.

98
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,870
So get out of my sight.

99
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,470
Oh, really?

100
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,380
All right, Master.

101
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,870
I'll get the hell out of your sight right away.

102
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,680
Please take your time.

103
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,600
What are you doing, Sanae?

104
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,730
Well, well...

105
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,220
Fujieda-san, umm...

106
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:22,960
Yes?

107
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,850
About what just happened...

108
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,190
It was just too sudden...

109
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,400
How should I put it?

110
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,570
Quit peeping.

111
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,820
Okay...

112
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,170
Like I said...

113
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:34,960
Yes?

114
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,970
Well...

115
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:37,830
Yes?

116
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,490
So how did you reply to her?

117
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,210
"Let's just start off by being friends."

118
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,620
That's such an ordinary reply.

119
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,520
There's no taste in it at all.

120
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,610
Leave me alone.

121
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,710
So, did you make any plans with that friend of yours?

122
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,430
We're going into town tomorrow.

123
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,220
Brother...

124
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,060
What?

125
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,230
Be a good escort.

126
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,480
Mio is my friend.

127
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,280
If you were to embarrass her...

128
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,280
Bang!

129
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,390
That's violent.

130
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,910
I'm supporting you guys.

131
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,030
Mio's a nice girl.

132
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,530
Yeah, I could tell right after our small chat.

133
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:17,700
So!

134
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,960
Give me some temporary pocket money!

135
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,040
I already gave you this month's.

136
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,680
Really? Really?

137
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,990
I can't believe you're already going on a date.

138
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,100
This is a great step forward for our late blooming Mio!

139
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,010
That's great.

140
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,470
What are you girls talking about?

141
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,070
Oh, Auntie.

142
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,250
Sorry for intruding.

143
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,450
Same here.

144
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,630
No, don't worry about it.

145
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,410
Auntie, this is a major event!

146
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,720
It's big news!

147
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,520
What is it?

148
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,980
Tomorrow, Mio's going on-

149
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,120
Don't say it!

150
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,150
Let me guess, a date?

151
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,240
How do you know?

152
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,550
Did you bring your boxed lunch?

153
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,880
I got it.

154
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,240
I'm off.

155
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,610
Wait a sec.

156
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,800
All right, now it's 40 points.

157
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,840
That's low.

158
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,120
Review what I told you yesterday.

159
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,410
I like you!

160
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,130
I love you.

161
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,630
It's not about money.

162
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,340
What kind of host are you?

163
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,290
Thank you for the meal.

164
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,440
It tasted really good.

165
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:46,420
I wanted to take you to a restaurant...

166
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,850
You live alone with Elen, right?

167
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,880
Our parents died in an accident.

168
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,680
I'm sorry.

169
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,930
Don't worry about it.

170
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,980
It was a long time ago.

171
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,440
I don't feel anything special about it.

172
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,180
You're strong, aren't you?

173
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,740
I live alone with my mom, too.

174
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:10,130
But knowing that my mother works so hard...

175
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,390
I sometimes wish I had a father.

176
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,320
That's what I think.

177
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,420
You have to support your mom.

178
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,840
If you need a guy for anything, I'm always around.

179
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,330
Thank you!

180
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,830
Let's see. Next is...

181
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,530
What's that?

182
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,230
That looks like Sanae's handwriting.

183
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,590
Go to a place that you can't say...

184
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,800
Reiji-san, what sort of a place is "a place that you can't say"?

185
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,880
After boarding the staircase that leads to adulthood,

186
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,600
you'll become Cinderella!

187
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,640
I'm a guy.

188
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,570
As long as you complete the schedule I gave you,

189
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,560
your date will end perfectly!

190
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,560
Damn that Sanae...

191
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,820
It's a woman.

192
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,010
It's amazing that she's riding such a big motorcycle.

193
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,460
I'd never be able to buy such an awesome bike since I'm destined to be poor-

194
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,510
Huh? When did...

195
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,860
Reiji-san?

196
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,840
Most of the sound was hidden by a silencer.

197
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,740
The sound of a 9mm parabellum bullet, huh?

198
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,830
That woke me up from my dream.

199
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,450
Traveling from Mexico to Peru by land.

200
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,490
Then from the Palau Islands to the Philippines.

201
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,500
And then it's been half a year since we've settled in Japan.

202
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:35,520
We should've forgotten our past and continued to live on here... On this piece of land.

203
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,030
This is your hometown.

204
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:52,910
You've changed a lot after coming to this country.

205
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,640
I can tell just by looking.

206
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,150
Your heart is opening up slowly.

207
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,450
That's what a hometown is, right?

208
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,120
But this is the end.

209
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,950
They're here.

210
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:10,950
Inferno?

211
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,690
I don't know.

212
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,380
But I received a silent warning.

213
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,330
I see.

214
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,460
So it's time we wake up from our dreams.

215
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:24,330
If it were possible, I'd like you to keep staying in your dreams.

216
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,330
To forget what you've been through.

217
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,280
What about you?

218
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,290
I...

219
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,450
I still need a confession of my sins.

220
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,820
Confession of your sins?

221
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,730
To who?

222
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:41,340
To God directly, because I'll meet with Him one day.

223
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,740
Elen...

224
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,430
Inferno is finally here.

225
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,990
Even though I don't want to...

226
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,620
We'll make use Fujieda-san's feelings.

227
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,830
Fujieda-san's feelings?

228
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,190
What do you mean, Elen?!

229
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:06,930
Right after giving birth to her, Fujieda-san's parents...

230
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,430
Yeah, I heard about it from her.

231
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,850
Everyone around her told her that her father had disappeared.

232
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:17,130
Even now, she still believes that lie.

233
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,100
Lie?

234
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,320
Her father is important enough to be in the newspaper.

235
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,190
Who was it?

236
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,200
Godoh Kaiten.

237
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,950
The leader of the large-area mafia group - the Godoh Group.

238
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,530
Godoh Group?!

239
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:32,990
Correct.

240
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,250
Fujieda is a surname from her mother's side.

241
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,540
That Godoh Group...

242
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,750
Does she know...

243
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,960
No, she doesn't.

244
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:52,060
Even inside the Godoh Group, only a few know of Mio's existence.

245
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:59,050
The entire reason was to protect his separated wife and daughter from the power struggle.

246
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,430
Then Mio and Godoh Daisuke are...

247
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,320
Yeah, siblings through the same father.

248
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,880
Godoh Kaiten doesn't want his daughter involved in any mayhem,

249
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,170
but he can't protect her out in the open.

250
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,820
Mio is Godoh Kaiten's biggest weakness.

251
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,400
How do you know that?

252
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,740
I heard it from Scythe Master.

253
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,280
Scythe Master?

254
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,310
It was from a long time ago,

255
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,530
but I told you that after Master escaped from Inferno,

256
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,380
he was hiding in Japan, right?

257
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,230
Yeah.

258
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,800
Back then, Master thoroughly investigated the Godoh Group.

259
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:47,740
Master also planned on using this weakness if he had to.

260
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,960
Weakness?

261
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,990
Don't tell me you want to use Fujieda-san to threaten the Godoh Group?

262
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,790
Just in case, it can be our ace card.

263
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,350
Right now, the young leader holding the Godoh Group's power is Shiga Toru.

264
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,920
A member of Inferno.

265
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,900
Now you understand the situation, right?

266
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:19,730
Even if it's Inferno you're going against, as long as you hold Mio as a hostage...

267
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,730
Why didn't you tell me?

268
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,610
That's right. I should've told you sooner.

269
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,350
If only I had known that Mio was interested in you.

270
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,240
If only I had known that they'd be here so quickly.

271
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:10,750
Our life here was surprisingly short.

272
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:17,320
We have to make preparations to escape.

273
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,450
Yeah, you're right.

274
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,410
We should escape.

275
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,660
Don't push yourself too hard.

276
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,500
It's okay to cry right now.

277
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,530
Right now, you can still be like how you were before.

278
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,770
That would be too selfish.

279
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,920
It's only natural to be prepared for something like this.

280
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,210
Since we're refugees.

281
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,700
No, you've already forgotten.

282
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,520
But that's good.

283
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,530
I was happy because of that.

284
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,980
Elen...

285
00:16:53,980 --> 00:17:01,800
For the past six months, your smile and sleeping face were filled with happiness.

286
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,860
Just looking at you like that made me happy.

287
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:13,550
If the hometown you were born in can bring peace to your heart...

288
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,360
Someday, I'll also...

289
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,100
That's the dream I have.

290
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:28,420
Because you promised me that one day you'd bring me back to my hometown.

291
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,450
I don't want the happiness you had up until now to be a lie.

292
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,010
We can come back another time.

293
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,790
Even if we leave, this country won't just disappear.

294
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,570
You'll definitely be able to come back to your hometown some day.

295
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:58,440
A day will come when we can live truly normal lives.

296
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,950
But that day is not now.

297
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,320
What?

298
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,890
Reiji left in the middle of the date?

299
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,960
It wasn't a date...

300
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,150
Also, Reiji-san said he had something important to do.

301
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:31,330
For young people in their prime,
nothing is more important than love!

302
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,590
You're too loud...

303
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,880
Jeez.

304
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,090
I even gave him a schedule!

305
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,280
Maybe you should just mind your own business.

306
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,690
That's too bad.

307
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,100
I guess...

308
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,720
Oh, "I guess"?

309
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,350
Speak of...

310
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,700
...the devil!

311
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,590
Hey, that hurts!

312
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,580
Sanae...

313
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,220
Come on, Sanae.

314
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,760
Reiji-san, I had a lot of fun yesterday.

315
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,810
Me too...

316
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,780
Did you take care of your important matter?

317
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,020
Yeah, I did.

318
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,330
You're pretty good to be able to block my attack.

319
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,330
You're just a little worse than me.

320
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,610
I have some business with Elen, so I need to go first.

321
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,580
Bye.

322
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,200
Where do you think you're going
and leaving your girlfriend behind?

323
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,650
Is he upset?

324
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,420
Something feels different...

325
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,510
About Reiji-san.

326
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,990
Why... Why are you here?!

327
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:22,510
No, putting that aside... Is it really you?

328
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,180
Were you still alive?

329
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,720
Cal!

330
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,790
We are...

331
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,340
...ghosts that cannot exist anywhere.

332
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,820
We are phantoms with no identity.

333
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,090
Nice to meet you, Ein.

334
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:33,460
Or should I call you... the Old Phantom?
