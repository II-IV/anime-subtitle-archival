1
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,410
Hey, quit slacking, transfer student.

2
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:54,920
Start cleaning.

3
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,200
He's such a weird guy.

4
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,820
He's always staring out into space and daydreaming.

5
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,960
Just like an airhead!

6
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,270
Lucky! The rain stopped.

7
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,810
It's pretty.

8
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,710
We almost missed it.

9
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,990
Because it's an expected view.

10
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,380
But unexpectedly, those kinds of views are usually the best.

11
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,460
The ship will depart on Monday at midnight.

12
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,830
We must meet with the people who will pick us up at Hotaru before the evening.

13
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,640
So we only have five days left, huh?

14
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,220
It'd be great if they'd just let us leave without any fuss.

15
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,590
I wonder if they will.

16
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,660
We should still be careful.

17
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,320
I don't want to leave any trouble behind.

18
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:16,260
If we can leave without a trace and disappear just like smoke, then...

19
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,600
Scythe!

20
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,860
What is it, Miss Garland?

21
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,780
Where's Phantom?

22
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,960
You better not be scheming anything.

23
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,540
Phantom?

24
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,340
I thought she'd be with you today.

25
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,860
She's nowhere to be found.

26
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,510
Crap!

27
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,630
Just take your eyes off her for a second, and...

28
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,140
This isn't something new.

29
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,400
She'll come back at night.

30
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,350
Weapons are missing, too.

31
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,550
A lot of them.

32
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:58,840
Oh?

33
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,180
That sounds pretty dangerous.

34
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,730
I wonder what she wants to do.

35
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,800
Whatever.

36
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,980
I can probably guess where she went.

37
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,250
Contact McGuire and Mr. Shiga. I'll go after Phantom right away.

38
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,490
So it has begun, huh?

39
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,890
She's just a kid.

40
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,160
Is something wrong with your head?

41
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,290
I'm just continuing what Zwei left behind.

42
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,270
But-

43
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,650
Drei?

44
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,240
Yep. That's my name from today on.

45
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,900
I'm looking forward to working with you.

46
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,010
I'll be counting on you.

47
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:31,670
Hey.

48
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,170
You're not gonna run away, right?

49
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,620
Jesus...

50
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,870
I'm not a babysitter.

51
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,020
I'm sorry for what happened the other day.

52
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,850
It probably scared you.

53
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,530
Not really...

54
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,060
Back when I was living in the U.S., she was my...

55
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,050
I didn't think she'd come all the way here for me.

56
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,700
I never thought she'd punch me right after seeing me.

57
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,570
But I'm glad I was able to see her once more.

58
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,490
Even if she hit me...

59
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,830
I've already talked to her about it,

60
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,620
so I guess that's the end of it.

61
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,460
Okay.

62
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,880
I'll pay you back next time.

63
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,800
Let's go to a movie again.

64
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:56,520
Later.

65
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,510
Good bye.

66
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,830
Huh? Why?

67
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,520
Oh yeah, Mom's not coming back today.

68
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,650
Yo, it's not like this is the first time we've met.

69
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,010
Don't be so scared.

70
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,990
Why are you here?

71
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,390
You're Godoh's princess, right?

72
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,270
Godoh? Are you talking about my uncle?

73
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,630
Uncle, huh?

74
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,110
Whatever, I'll leave the explanations for later.

75
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,870
Umm...

76
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,940
You might not see these very often in this country,

77
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,060
but yeah, it's real.

78
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:12,880
Get on.

79
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,640
Let me tell you about...

80
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,410
...your beloved Reiji's secret.

81
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,460
I thought you'd be arriving soon, Phantom.

82
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,000
Just give me a second.

83
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,200
Great timing.

84
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,910
I have something to talk to you about, too.

85
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,620
Cal...

86
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,840
The game continues.

87
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,470
No one is allowed to touch Zwei or Ein.

88
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,560
If you guys don't abide by that rule,

89
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,150
I'll kill the princess.

90
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,860
I won't let anyone get in my way.

91
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,500
Don't touch my prey.

92
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,520
Quit doing such stupid things.

93
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,490
Do you really hate Zwei that much?

94
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,980
No shit!

95
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:49,270
I'll never forgive traitors and bastards who ruin other people's normal lives.

96
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,160
There's a line you should never cross.

97
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,350
Wake up already, Cal.

98
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,950
If you cross it, you'll fall into hell.

99
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,410
I've always thought it was weird.

100
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:19,210
Lizzie, why were you always so kind to me?

101
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,830
I didn't want you to become an assassin.

102
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,950
Both Zwei and I,

103
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,970
we thought the same way.

104
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,410
Everyone is so selfish...

105
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,500
I am Phantom.

106
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,540
If you don't like it, try stopping me.

107
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,510
Right here, right now.

108
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,840
I'll draw when this song ends.

109
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:08,260
If you don't shoot by then, you must be one hell of a naÃ¯ve person.

110
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,430
So naÃ¯ve that you deserve to die here.

111
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,250
Cal.

112
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,020
I...

113
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,170
...don't want to shoot you.

114
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,470
Cal!

115
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,300
Why didn't you shoot?

116
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,530
You're asking me why...?

117
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,390
Are you sure you want such a heavy one?

118
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,800
Yeah, I don't want to shoot unless I have to.

119
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:47,630
But this thing... This thing is getting heavier and heavier...

120
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,760
It's too heavy...

121
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,880
Clau...

122
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,980
This will go on for three or four days, so eat sparingly.

123
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,070
Why are you doing this?

124
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,630
Please explain the situation.

125
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,300
Why are you doing this? Even killing someone...

126
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:36,820
That's my-

127
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,810
This is the last person you contacted, right?

128
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:49,300
You read this as "Reiji", right?

129
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,040
Who are you to Reiji-san?

130
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,700
A previous apprentice...

131
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,630
...and his ex.

132
00:15:59,270 --> 00:15:59,730
You're lying.

133
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,070
Why do you think that?

134
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,580
What do you know about him?

135
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:16,770
By the way, Reiji was the one who taught me how to use this.

136
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,450
What do you think he was doing back in the states?

137
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,100
He was an assassin.

138
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,650
And he was the best of them all.

139
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,100
He killed countless amounts of people.

140
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,980
No way...

141
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,500
He lied to you.

142
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,870
Two years ago, Godoh Daisuke died in Los Angeles.

143
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,160
If I remember correctly, he's your uncle, right?

144
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,930
How do you know-

145
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:49,100
Of course I know. And I know more about it than you do.

146
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,380
Godoh Daisuke was a part of a gang...

147
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:59,930
And he's not your uncle, but actually your brother from a different mother...

148
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,490
I know everything.

149
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,410
You're lying!

150
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,760
What's up with you?

151
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,390
Are you unsatisfied with being the daughter of a gang family?

152
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,730
That's not all.

153
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,890
Godoh Daisuke didn't die by accident.

154
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,230
He was killed because of your beloved Reiji...

155
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,030
Stop it!

156
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,700
It's up to you to believe it or not.

157
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,800
However, there will be a bloodbath soon because of you.

158
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,160
Think about what I told you when that happens.

159
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,960
You'll understand everything.

160
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,350
What's your goal?

161
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,930
A death match.

162
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,700
A death match with Reiji.

163
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,780
No way...

164
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,510
The sun's up.

165
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,730
Now, let it begin.

166
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:13,800
Hello?

167
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,830
Sorry, this ain't Mio.

168
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,090
What did you do to her?

169
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,910
Don't worry.

170
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,060
I don't plan on doing anything to her.

171
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,420
You're already so busy with the escape preparations,

172
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,910
I don't think you'll be able to handle an extra hostage.

173
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,700
So I'm looking after her for you.

174
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,540
I wasn't your only target?

175
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,790
This has nothing to do with her.

176
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,860
Didn't you want to return to a normal lifestyle?

177
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:47,100
Just as you wished, I'm protecting the lifestyle that you wanted.

178
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:52,200
I won't let the Godoh Group or Inferno do anything.

179
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,050
You'll be fine as long as you go to school normally.

180
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:02,010
But you can't just disappear out of the blue.

181
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,290
I don't know where you're running to,

182
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,950
but if you leave my sight,

183
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,390
Mio will be seeing her brother!

184
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:16,550
Remember this. I'm always watching you.

185
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:21,460
This time, you won't be able to run...

186
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,590
This time...

187
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,440
I can't believe she betrayed Inferno.

188
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,760
That just shows how much she hates me.

189
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,590
We should act independently now.

190
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:38,860
Independently?

191
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,490
My, my.

192
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,430
Fujieda Mio was kidnapped by Phantom!

193
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,810
Why are you letting that bitch run free?!

194
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,570
You've got pretty amazing sources.

195
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,050
Quit messing around with me!

196
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,860
Wasn't this part of your calculations?!

197
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,020
No way.

198
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,550
That girl is Bro's memento!

199
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,500
She's not your toy!

200
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,640
This event might damage the name of Inferno.

201
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:24,160
I will try my best to protect Ms. Fujieda Mio.

202
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,560
I'll go search for Drei,

203
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,830
and you'll follow her instructions.

204
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,670
I'll kill her and rescue Mio.

205
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,830
But she's watching us...

206
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,540
If we were to do anything reckless, Mio will...

207
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:48,150
Even if I'm gone, Drei won't do anything to Mio.

208
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,160
Why are you so certain?

209
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,580
Her only target is you.

210
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,200
But...

211
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,280
We're not cornered yet.

212
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:04,330
Control your emotions. The one who can't do that...

213
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:07,810
...will die.

214
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,090
Don't worry, Mr. Shiga.

215
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,830
I've summoned my private staff.

216
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:21,950
The ultimate weapons that were perfectly trained.

217
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,710
Extreme determination with suppressed emotions.

218
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,780
They will end everything.

219
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:41,690
I promise you a satisfying end.

220
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,320
They won't fail, no matter what.

221
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,320
We are...

222
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,070
...ghosts that cannot exist anywhere.

223
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,450
We are phantoms with no identity.

224
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:27,150
If you can live on...

225
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:32,270
...that'll be proof that I lived.
