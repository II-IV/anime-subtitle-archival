1
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,930
I kill people with this hand, and I also eat with this hand...

2
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,400
There's no difference.

3
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,570
I do these things... in order to live.

4
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,770
That's how it is, right?

5
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,430
Yo.

6
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,490
That was unfortunate, hardhead.

7
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,890
Gant, you bastard! Is that all you can say on a day like this?

8
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,710
You've got a nice look in your eyes, Tony.

9
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,040
What are you talking about, old man Gant?

10
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,270
Don't play dumb.

11
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,540
I've known you guys since you were snotty brats.

12
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,130
So I can tell...

13
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:27,500
That look in your eyes is telling me you're about to start a bloodbath.

14
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,890
Don't do anything dumb, all right?

15
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,600
I'm always watching you.

16
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,780
Are we going to do it, Tony?

17
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,330
Yeah. We're going to crush Inferno.

18
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,760
It's not for revenge. It's to protect our town.

19
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,760
But Gant is keeping a close eye on us.

20
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,660
We can't make any careless moves.

21
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,580
I've got an idea.

22
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,440
There's a way to give them the coup de grÃ¢ce without dirtying our hands.

23
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,230
Inferno is basically a bunch of traitors...

24
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,430
...who go against their bosses,
and join hands with their families' rivals.

25
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,990
Among the organizations on the West Coast,

26
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,930
these fifteen would benefit from joining Inferno.

27
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,780
Richard Harrington. Carlo Mendoza.

28
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,340
Are you saying that big shots like them are joining hands behind the scenes?

29
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,470
If we obtain evidence of that and reveal it to the public, they're done for.

30
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,010
Any organization would take care of misconduct by people in their own group.

31
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,470
Those who spit on the code of conduct...

32
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,840
...will bite the dust because of their own misdeeds.

33
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,720
Amazing... That's the most intelligent way.

34
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,370
Anton, I'll leave the arrangements to you.

35
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,050
Stay close to them and reveal their true colors.

36
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,230
However... be cautious.

37
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,320
Good morning, Ms. McCunnen.

38
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,490
You look stunningly beautiful as always.

39
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,520
Why are you here?

40
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,380
I called him here.

41
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,530
He offers his opinions based on his unique insights.

42
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,380
We can gain a lot from them.

43
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:26,080
I plan to have him participate in future executive meetings as a regular.

44
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,430
Any objections?

45
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,270
No sir.

46
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,960
The reason I called for an urgent meeting today...

47
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,510
...is to inform you of Tony Stone's latest actions.

48
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,950
Tony? That hardhead is still trying to do something?

49
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,040
I've obtained information that he's using spies.

50
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,940
I did think that there was an annoying fly buzzing around lately.

51
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,710
So he was sent by Tony of all people.

52
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:03,160
Seems like the message we sent him the other day had the opposite effect.

53
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,900
If they had come at us in a frenzy,
that would have actually been convenient for us.

54
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,550
But I didn't expect that he'd try to strike our weak point.

55
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,550
I suppose we should get rid of him immediately.

56
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:20,480
However, our goal at the beginning was to gain
the Stone Family's turf without turning it into a battlefield.

57
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,520
You have some sort of plan?

58
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,660
I can't help but to think...

59
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,450
...that Tony Stone's careless action is a once-in-a-million chance.

60
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,280
Oh? Sounds interesting.

61
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,950
Let us hear it.

62
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,810
Ein's been gone for a while now.

63
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,940
That's reckless. A daring plan like that can't possibly...

64
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,620
It's possible if we use Phantom.

65
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,670
I think she's proven her ability many times by now.

66
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:18,630
True. Although the scale is bigger,

67
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,860
it's not that much more reckless than her previous missions.

68
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,670
This might even work out.

69
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,420
I'd like to hear your decision, Mr. McGuire.

70
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,970
You sure know the right timing to promote your talent.

71
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,970
Thank you very much.

72
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,800
Fine.

73
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,680
Why don't we take a chance on that confidence of yours, Scythe Master.

74
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,700
Good, Ein. Wonderful.

75
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,530
You're really the best subject.

76
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:03,620
This meaningless world filled with confusion will be completely transformed by my will.

77
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:07,330
A new order... A new balance...

78
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,410
I will build it all.

79
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,720
In this program, even God is just an audience member watching from the upper gallery!

80
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,200
You are the lead... Ein.

81
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,370
My precious prima donna.

82
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,150
Did the meeting drag on?

83
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,110
These are the instructions for our next operation. Look through them later.

84
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,950
This one is a series of missions. Our targets consist of...

85
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,590
...twelve people.

86
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,970
Twelve? Don't tell me we're killing all of them in one night?

87
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,470
Our individual missions aren't hard.

88
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:02,490
We have to time things carefully and aim to be perfectly in-sync.

89
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,010
These are all executives of Inferno's rivals.

90
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,890
If this succeeds, the power balance on the West Coast will change considerably.

91
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,690
Is this okay? Isn't it too hasty?

92
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,870
That's not something you should be worrying about.

93
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,250
It's natural to think about the meaning of the mission, right?

94
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,960
Did someone tell you that?

95
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,860
You shouldn't bother.

96
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,580
It doesn't suit our way of existing.

97
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,600
So what's our way of existing?

98
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,060
Being a tool... Being a device...

99
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,330
All we need to do is function.

100
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,210
Don't think about unnecessary things.

101
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,910
How can you say that so firmly?

102
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,200
Does thinking harm us?

103
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,040
We'll break...

104
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,710
Both me...

105
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,960
...and you...

106
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,940
Looks like everything is ready, yes?

107
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,900
Take that stupid smile off your face, you snaky bastard.

108
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,470
Your plan isn't even an operation. It's acrobatics.

109
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,660
It's the same as walking a tightrope or jumping through a flaming hoop.

110
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,540
I only planned it because I have confidence in your abilities.

111
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:50,690
And anyways, why are you running this all by yourself as if you own the place?

112
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,710
Where's Clau?

113
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,110
She said she couldn't come because she had something else to attend to.

114
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,840
What are we going to do with her?

115
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:04,290
If Clau orders it, I'll go out on a limb no matter how dangerous it is.

116
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,850
But I have no reason to risk my life on your orders.

117
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,130
We'll have more and more of this kind of operations.

118
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:17,190
You may want to rethink how you decide to treat me...

119
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,030
...Ms. Garland.

120
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,370
Lizzie, it's time.

121
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,370
Don't just stand there! Let's go!

122
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,060
Let's go.

123
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,720
Yeah.

124
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,270
Well then. I'll see you later.

125
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,560
Phase one, complete.

126
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,270
Roger. Initiating Phase two.

127
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,120
The back! He escaped to the back!

128
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,720
Search over there!

129
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,890
I got him! Over here!

130
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,110
Who the hell is this guy?

131
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,370
I feel like I've seen him before.

132
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,620
I think he was working as a bouncer on Tony's turf.

133
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:14,560
The Stone Family?! Why did they come after the old man?

134
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,780
Those bastards!

135
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:21,210
There haven't been any suspicious actions from Carlos tonight.

136
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,130
He's having dinner at one of his usual restaurants right now.

137
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,140
What a carefree guy.

138
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,990
Yes. Okay.

139
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,410
Well then, I'll talk to you on the next scheduled call.

140
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,130
What's going on?!

141
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,570
With regards to Allen Construction's bidding,

142
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,670
there was a rumor that the local mafia was involved.

143
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,910
So it's possible that this is a gang war.

144
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,890
I see.

145
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,220
Ah, yes.

146
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,570
According to the information we've just received,

147
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:45,190
there was a gunfight and car accident on the Pacific Coast Highway.

148
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,730
We have a relay from the scene.

149
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,640
They're all overreacting.

150
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,360
The night has just begun.

151
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:57,740
You mean there's going to be more of that?!

152
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,940
Tonight's bloodshed is only the beginning.

153
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,360
From here on, it will truly be an era dominated by survival of the fittest.

154
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:37,240
It's a world where any dream is possible so long as you have power.

155
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:44,650
Mr. Godoh... would that way of life... appeal to you?

156
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,220
Anton, what the hell is going on?!

157
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,260
Abel, Bark... No one's reporting!

158
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,320
When things have gotten this serious!

159
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,970
All of them are probably dead by now.

160
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,760
Like a bullet, they left their mark.

161
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,740
I'm sure they're satisfied.

162
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,440
What do you mean?!

163
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,230
Are you saying that it was Bark and the others?!

164
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,050
Who killed Don Ronny and Hugo?!

165
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,860
That's what everyone will assume...

166
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:38,910
...since no one will go interview them in their tombs.

167
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,830
Anton... Why...?

168
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,500
Don't you get it? I guess you don't...

169
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,170
...since you're hardheaded.

170
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,580
Well done, kid.

171
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:11,450
Yeah. Now I can say goodbye to this filthy town.

172
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,540
It took me twenty-five years to get out of this cesspool.

173
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,090
I'm sick and tired of it.

174
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,010
You're retiring at such a young age?

175
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:29,130
I've received enough compensation from Inferno.

176
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,910
I'll buy a cottage or something on a Caribbean beach.

177
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,250
What's your cut?

178
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,190
My first promotion in fifteen years.

179
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:40,870
I did end a mafia war, after all.

180
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,940
Looks like both of us will live a long life.

181
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,530
An era came to an end yesterday.

182
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:00,860
The six old men who had controlled the underworld on the West Coast for a long time...

183
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,870
...died tragically.

184
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:06,800
Tony Stone was considered the mastermind of it all,

185
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,460
and the law brought him to justice.

186
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,810
Having lost their leaders,

187
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:18,440
each organization will be led to the new era by our compatriots...

188
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,320
...under one name: Inferno.

189
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,740
Outstanding. Another miracle performed by your Phantom.

190
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,830
Thank you very much.

191
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:40,400
Lieutenant Cyrus Gant, who resolved the mafia war that shook the entire city,

192
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,380
received an award from the mayor for his deeds.

193
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:49,200
Tony Stone, who was known as gang leader and boss of Melanie Square,

194
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,560
I wonder if everyone actually believes what's being said here.

195
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:56,460
simultaneously attacked six West Coast-based criminal organizations, and succeeded in every attempt.

196
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:58,560
No one cares about the truth... nor are they interested.

197
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:02,140
However, his ambitions were suddenly crushed by Lieutenant Gant's heroic actions.

198
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,350
I wonder who'll pray for the people who died that day.

199
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,870
I wonder who'll atone for those sins.

200
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,740
There's neither prayer nor atonement.

201
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,410
Death is the end of everything.

202
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,690
No matter what you do after that...

203
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,190
...it's meaningless.

204
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,620
There is nothing.

205
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,590
Dreams are just illusions.

206
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,300
All they do is get in the way of reality.
