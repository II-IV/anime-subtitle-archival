1
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:36,900
Reiji...

2
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,250
My apologies for arriving late.

3
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,290
You are...

4
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,190
Uncle Daisuke's...

5
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,100
Hey, Mom...

6
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,880
Is this about your dad?

7
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,520
A lot of people mentioned Dad and Uncle Daisuke...

8
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,620
I knew we'd have to talk about this eventually.

9
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,030
But that time came sooner than I expected.

10
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,470
The truth is your father isn't dead.

11
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,620
He's still alive.

12
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,390
He lives in an unimaginably cruel world.

13
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,230
Mom...

14
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,590
...are you okay with that?

15
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,530
Back then, I wanted us to live together.

16
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,430
I didn't mind giving up my life for that.

17
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,870
But...

18
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,100
I'm glad things are the way they are.

19
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,180
By leaving me behind,

20
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,110
he was able to keep his memories of me.

21
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,890
The only precious thing in our hearts that we can rely on.

22
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,460
He longed for how we live now.

23
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,120
But that's something he'll never reach.

24
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,340
A place that can only be thought of from far far away.

25
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,090
A place that can only be reached in dreams.

26
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:07,840
If I had followed him instead,
his wishes would have been destroyed.

27
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,480
I'm living the life that he wanted to live.

28
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,110
Just being together is not real love.

29
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,110
Mom...

30
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,820
Daisuke was the son of your father and his previous wife.

31
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:34,520
He endured everything because he had a little sister who was living the life that he dreamed of.

32
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,670
That's what he told me.

33
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,080
I...

34
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,150
I have something to tell him.

35
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,960
Jeez...

36
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,060
She definitely has my blood.

37
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,780
Crap... I can't find them without any clues!

38
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,330
Is this Fujieda?!

39
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,590
Yes, Elen saved me.

40
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,570
I'm back home now.

41
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,750
That's great.

42
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,250
Reiji...

43
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,630
Elen and Cal are going to kill each other.

44
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,630
I overheard their phone conversation.

45
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:38,920
She said it'll be at some place that they both know at 3am.

46
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,210
A place that they both know?

47
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,570
And also... Cal must be in a lot of pain.

48
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,380
She has no one to talk to.

49
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,340
Reiji, I'm counting on you to take care of them.

50
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,290
Okay, don't worry.

51
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,080
I'll definitely do something about it.

52
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,110
Fujieda...

53
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm really sorry about what happened this time.

54
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,550
It's all my fault.

55
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,370
Don't say that. I don't mind at all.

56
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,400
I'll forget about it by tomorrow.

57
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,150
That's why I'll always be here to welcome you.

58
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,990
I love your smiling face.

59
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:35,700
If you can be that happy, it must mean that this place is right for you.

60
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,470
Thank you.

61
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,560
Really, thank you.

62
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,930
Fujieda, I-

63
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,730
I'll wait for you.

64
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:54,140
I'll always wait for the day when you'll return to this city without any worries.

65
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,320
That's why this isn't goodbye.

66
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,890
Please be safe.

67
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,260
All right.

68
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,400
I'm off.

69
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:23,150
Listen up. Don't go easy on them just because they're kids.

70
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,460
Are you going to kill them?

71
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,430
I'll be right there.

72
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,870
I've sworn to prevent Mio from getting hurt ever again.

73
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,580
Do you think this is what she wants?

74
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,980
This is the one promise I made to Daisuke.

75
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,170
How selfish.

76
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,730
You people are always like this.

77
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,950
Shiga, the one who shot Daisuke was...

78
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:22,870
What's the point of all this?

79
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,990
There's no point.

80
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,860
I'm doing it because I can. That's all there is to it.

81
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,260
What will come of this?

82
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,640
Nothing at all.

83
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,070
She'll die and I'll burn out.

84
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,500
The end.

85
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,450
That's all.

86
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,330
Is that everything you desire?

87
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,980
Of course! What else could I wish for?

88
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,490
And what about you guys?!

89
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,690
What have you accomplished while you've been alive?!

90
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,750
What'll be left after you die?!

91
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,550
Nothing at all!

92
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,300
And just like that, everyone dies like pieces of trash!

93
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,450
Correct.

94
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,430
And that will also apply to you one day.

95
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,500
You'll have no proof of your existence nor a meaning in life...

96
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,570
...and die.

97
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,790
Quit joking around.

98
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,590
Don't compare me with you guys.

99
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,080
I'm the almighty Phantom!

100
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:38,260
I've finally found the thing I'm better at than everyone else.

101
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,630
I found a way of life that people can't look down upon.

102
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:48,000
This is all I am...

103
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,100
What I do is to take away and destroy.

104
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:59,740
I don't want to have it done to me anymore...

105
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,450
I thought you'd be here.

106
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,940
"I think this is the best choice."

107
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,510
Do you really believe that?

108
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,670
Yes.

109
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,940
You can't kill Cal.

110
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,990
No, I can and I will.

111
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,640
I'll bear all her anger and sadness.

112
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,230
I'll be the saddest person in this world when she dies.

113
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,360
I can mourn for her.

114
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,690
So let me kill her.

115
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,170
No, you'll lose for sure.

116
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:26,550
I'll never let myself lose you.

117
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:27,870
Elen...

118
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,970
You're the only one who can't do that.

119
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,930
Because you're gentle.

120
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,880
Because you won't be able to kill her.

121
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,660
I'll stay, too.

122
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,530
The two of us will definitely be able to defeat her.

123
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,930
You have to understand this!

124
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,760
This is the seed I've sown!

125
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,860
If I don't settle this here, I'll always be bound by my past.

126
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,400
I won't be able to free myself.

127
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,980
Elen, leave first!

128
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,000
I'll come right after!

129
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,890
Where can I go without you?

130
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,240
I don't even know where I came from...

131
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,120
I don't even have any memories!

132
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,860
What should I do to free myself?

133
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,920
What good is freedom built on the deaths of others?

134
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,340
Tell me! Please!

135
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,950
Let's go find it together.

136
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,740
I'll definitely return to your side to fulfill that promise.

137
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,490
Reiji...

138
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,490
Elen won't be coming.

139
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,250
Why are you here?

140
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,410
This is my duty.

141
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,730
To protect that girl?

142
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,800
No, Cal.

143
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,010
To kill you.

144
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,510
I've sacrificed countless people up until now.

145
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:57,280
I've tricked countless people,
used them and killed them in the end.

146
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,270
Just for the sake of staying alive.

147
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,530
You've got quite the nerve...

148
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,580
You're right, Cal.

149
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,470
Your anger represents justice.

150
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,840
You don't need to bring this to court.

151
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,740
Just use your gun to bring judgment upon me.

152
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:17,260
Not by anyone else, but by yourself.

153
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,540
If you're stronger than me,

154
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,050
then I'll be punished.

155
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,010
Just the way I want it.

156
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,450
I won't let you interfere.

157
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,280
Get her!

158
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,410
If you really want to have a match, then this is the perfect choice.

159
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,630
That's...

160
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,630
You still remember?

161
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,540
This is our karma.

162
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,630
My guidepost up until now.

163
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:17,650
This thing always reminds me of who to hate and who to kill.

164
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,990
A duel.

165
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,890
When this song ends, we shoot.

166
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,030
Okay?

167
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,030
You're the only one...

168
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,540
...who is still alive after hearing this song, Reiji.

169
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,170
What? Did you fall asleep?

170
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,610
I had a dream about back when we were in Los Angeles.

171
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,800
What kind of dream?

172
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:05,400
What would've happened if we hadn't seen each other after the place got blown up?

173
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,550
That's so stupid!

174
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,750
As if you'd make a stupid mistake like that.

175
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,590
That would never happen.

176
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:17,100
There's no way we'll be separated.

177
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,430
If that really happened, I would go look for you.

178
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,870
Even to the ends of the Earth...

179
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,520
That's impossible.

180
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,840
I'm a hopeless idiot.

181
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,780
Why am I thinking of such things?

182
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:44,480
It might not be so bad to think about things from time to time.

183
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,170
It might not be so bad...

184
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:55,300
At least something like that can happen in a dream...

185
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,360
Is this where Judy Devens passed away?

186
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,990
Why are you so strong?

187
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,840
This is this only way I can answer you.

188
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,230
Oh...

189
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:38,440
Then I can still have you all to myself at the end?

190
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,810
That's great...

191
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,140
I don't need anything else...

192
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,810
Do you have to sacrifice yourself for such things?

193
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,610
What do you mean by "such things"?

194
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,320
Is there something better?

195
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,290
I think we had other ways to live our lives.

196
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,480
If we had met some other way, we might have been able to live happily ever after.

197
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,940
Yeah...

198
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:21,340
We just messed up somewhere, that's all...

199
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,550
That has to be it.

200
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,390
I'm glad I met you.

201
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm...

202
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,460
...satisfied...

203
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,400
...and happy...

204
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,790
Cal!

205
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,580
Cal...

206
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,570
CAL!!!

207
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:25,350
Phantom, you monster!

208
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,750
I really don't understand this.

209
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,820
Mr. Shiga, I thought you were smarter than this.

210
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,700
Why didn't you just leave it to us?

211
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,700
You bastard!

212
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,670
You've been watching this whole time?!

213
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:53,600
It's time for the final act.

214
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,980
There's no place in the cast for you unrefined stage props.

215
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:01,770
If you want to stay, then please do so.

216
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:09,120
Please feel privileged to be able to see my best work.

217
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,020
The concerto of the strongest ghosts.

218
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:18,130
Now then, who will respond to the curtain call?

219
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,720
I will kill.

220
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:43,110
I will kill in order to live.

221
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,560
We are...

222
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,250
...ghosts that cannot exist anywhere.

223
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:59,040
We are phantoms with no identity.

224
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,290
In my wrongful life where I couldn't fulfill any promises,

225
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,590
there is still one promise I want to fulfill.
