1
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,650
I'll... do it.

2
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,300
Leave Cal to me.

3
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,300
Are you planning to die?

4
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,160
That's not it.

5
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,810
I need you to work out a plan for our escape.

6
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,700
Our time is limited.

7
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,550
I don't want to waste our time on Cal.

8
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,310
So I'll take care of it.

9
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,300
I asked you this before, but...

10
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,320
Do you really have the determination to shoot her?

11
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,780
Well...

12
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,830
Please.

13
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,840
Give me some time to think about it.

14
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,330
All right.

15
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,350
But make your decision by today.

16
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,630
If you can't decide...

17
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,860
...then I'll take care of Drei myself.

18
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,880
I'll...

19
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,870
...save Mio, too.

20
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,040
I can't let Elen shoot Cal.

21
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,500
I have to settle it myself.

22
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,470
No one else.

23
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,890
Reiji.

24
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,810
Reiji.

25
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,390
I want to be with you.

26
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,450
Reiji.

27
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,710
What is it?

28
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,650
Want to eat lunch with us?

29
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,720
You're basically handcuffed to Mio.
You don't really get a chance to eat lunch with us.

30
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,050
We're going to have a lonely table today,

31
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,400
since both Mio and Elen are absent.

32
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,210
Elen is absent?!

33
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,670
We both got to school this morning!

34
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,280
She left early.

35
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,800
She said she wasn't feeling well since this morning.

36
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,630
You didn't notice it at all?

37
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:05,370
Hey-

38
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,130
Wait!

39
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,830
Tell me how far along you've gotten with Mio!

40
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:21,780
Elen!

41
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:27,820
The person you are trying to reach is currently not available. Please hang up and try-

42
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,890
Found you!

43
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,000
Quit running and tell us!

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,790
How far along have you gotten with-

45
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,150
Hold on!

46
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,920
I'm a bit-

47
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,770
What's the rush?

48
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,340
Are you that worried about Elen?

49
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,980
You've got quite a sister complex-

50
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,560
Hey, you two!

51
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,260
5th period is about to start!

52
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,510
Aw, geez...

53
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,880
Let's go back.

54
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,590
Hey!

55
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,630
"Keep your phone off during class."

56
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,600
It's called common sense.

57
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,710
All right, let's get back to class.

58
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,330
This is the voicemail system.

59
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,850
You have one new message.

60
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,540
You might be angry by the time you hear this message.

61
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,540
But...

62
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,940
I think this is the best choice.

63
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,920
You shouldn't fight Cal.

64
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,360
I'm the one who dragged Mio into this.

65
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,120
I'll save her, even if it costs me my life.

66
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,700
So...

67
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,180
I want you to go ahead and escape without me.

68
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,070
I'll catch up with you after I rescue Mio.

69
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,070
If...

70
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,090
If by any chance, I don't make it by the appointed time...

71
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:01,070
Think of me as dead.

72
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,900
Message received today, at 2:15 pm.

73
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,190
Don't do it...

74
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,840
Don't do it, Elen!

75
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,060
I don't want to lose anyone again.

76
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,560
I can't stand to see anyone get hurt again!

77
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,780
No one!

78
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,190
So that's Ein...

79
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,140
Our prototype.

80
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,250
We must contact Master.

81
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,740
You've got some determination.

82
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,100
I was expecting you to wail and put up a fight.

83
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,100
I'm not an animal.

84
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,670
You were completely fooled by that guy, which is why you're here right now.

85
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,780
I wouldn't be surprised if you looked bitter about it.

86
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,110
Are you bitter yourself?

87
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,300
That you were-

88
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,300
Talking shit now, are we?

89
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,680
I still can't believe it.

90
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,630
That someone could carry this much hatred...

91
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,480
You're not the only one who had to endure sadness.

92
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,420
I'm sure Reiji also-

93
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,710
What do you know?

94
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,430
I can tell.

95
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,780
There's no way I wouldn't be able to tell.

96
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,170
Because I truly love him with all my heart.

97
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,140
You're such a liar!

98
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,670
That's right.

99
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,940
You, Reiji...

100
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,500
You're all liars.

101
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,650
Is that the same for everyone from this country?

102
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,560
Have you ever shivered from the cold?

103
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,400
Have you ever gotten the crap beaten out of you?

104
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,780
Have you ever survived without eating for three days?!

105
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,510
Who the hell do you think you are?

106
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:50,690
Do you really think that nothing in this world can hurt you?

107
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:56,100
You've been treated like a princess your entire life!

108
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,680
Do you think everyone lives like that?!

109
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,280
In a foolish country like this...

110
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,190
What would a pampered bitch like you understand?

111
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,680
You don't understand a thing.

112
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,860
You don't know the pain of others...

113
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,740
No!

114
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,960
Please, stop!

115
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:20,330
I only had one outfit to wear.

116
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,330
And that one burned to a crisp, too.

117
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:30,460
What did you eat growing up to get such smooth skin?

118
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,090
Huh?!

119
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,550
I'm asking you, Princess.

120
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,160
I'll tell you...

121
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,660
...the meaning of true despair.

122
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:46,600
The feeling of being powerless and unable to fight back...

123
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,320
I'll engrave it into your body.

124
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,530
A deep scar on your heart that will be with you for the rest of your life!

125
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,730
I waited here for you... for such a long time...

126
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:24,370
Because you promised me you'd come back, no matter what...

127
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,660
I waited...

128
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,290
...for such a long time...

129
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,280
For a long time...

130
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,710
Reiji...

131
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,030
Is that you, Shiga?

132
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,010
Pardon me, Boss.

133
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:27,410
It seems like you have bad news.

134
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,030
It's about Fujieda Mio.

135
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:36,040
Because of my inattentiveness, your daughter has been dragged into a bit of trouble.

136
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,550
Even now, we haven't got a minute to lose.

137
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,280
I understand that I'm to take full responsibility for the matter.

138
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,220
But before that, I believe rescuing Mio is of higher priority.

139
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:56,770
I'm requesting that we dispatch the Godoh Group's retainers to settle the conflict-

140
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:00,600
Is it those Americans who are behind this?

141
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,090
Is Mio still alive?

142
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,330
Yes. We are sure of that.

143
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,320
In that case, it's best not to meddle.

144
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,030
Don't use the Godoh Group.

145
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,710
Let those foreigners take care of everything.

146
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,130
But...

147
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,340
If the Group gets involved, the entire nation will know about it.

148
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:30,710
"Why is the Godoh Group getting so worked up over one girl?"

149
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,600
That's what everyone will think.

150
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:38,390
And I don't intend to make you take full responsibility for it either.

151
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,410
But then!

152
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,320
I'm saying that there's no need, Shiga!

153
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,660
There's no connection between the Godoh and the Fujieda. There mustn't be one!

154
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:52,120
Even now... and even in the past...

155
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,660
Do I make myself clear?

156
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,060
As long as Mio's life isn't in danger, do not take action.

157
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,630
As long as they're not after money or trying to blackmail us, there's nothing we can do.

158
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,800
But I do appreciate you looking out for her.

159
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:15,020
Shiga, in the end, Yakuza are just useless good-for-nothings.

160
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,650
Especially when it comes to protecting something.

161
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,660
Swords and guns are only good for destroying and killing.

162
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,630
They can't protect anything.

163
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,660
Understood, sir.

164
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,740
I will keep that in mind.

165
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:41,010
I've been acting as myself, within the repertoire that I created.

166
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:48,930
That repertoire, that play... has changed its colors, and is nearing its end.

167
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,520
The creation of the ultimate soldiers.

168
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,480
The first creation was Ein.

169
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,940
And the experimental creations were Zwei and Drei.

170
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:05,220
By using the results of those experiments, the performers best suited for the final act have been created...

171
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,800
Zahlenschwestern.

172
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:13,870
Note: "Zahlenschwestern" means "number sisters" in German

173
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,860
They have no fear. They know no mercy.

174
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,500
Automatons who carry death like faithful hounds.

175
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,760
Both the Godoh Group and Inferno are nothing but stage props.

176
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:33,440
When Ein and Zwei, who have been driven into a tight corner by Drei, bare their fangs like the beasts they are...

177
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,930
The dream contest between my works of art will commence.

178
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,940
I want you Zahlenschwestern to participate in that contest.

179
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,590
Let's wait for a bit.

180
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:54,030
Until we hear the closing chimes.

181
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,030
Is that you, Ein?

182
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,660
Drei, right?

183
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,180
Tell me what you want.

184
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,040
Pick a place where we won't have any interferences.

185
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,670
I'll put an end to everything.

186
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,050
Yeah, that's right.

187
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,360
Without him.

188
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,730
Just the two of us.

189
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,000
My... phone...?

190
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,060
Don't tell me she's talking to Reiji...

191
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,080
Okay. That place sounds good.

192
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,070
Three in the morning, right?

193
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,970
Do you know about the ruins that are above Shinokura Academy?

194
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,330
The place that used to be the girl's dormitory, right?

195
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,830
Yeah, that place.

196
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,060
That's where Mio is.

197
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,520
You'd better prepare something for her to wear.

198
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,600
Looks like you're awake.

199
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,080
Just forget this ever happened.

200
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,740
It's not worth it to hate me.

201
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:02,240
Even if you choose to, there are tons of people who hate me, and would refuse to forgive me.

202
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:10,170
I doubt I'll live for long, and when my time comes, I'll go to hell for sure.

203
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,380
See ya.

204
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,710
Mio?

205
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,080
Where were you? I was worried sick-

206
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,250
I'm Mio's classmate.

207
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,510
She was absent from school today, so I brought her assignments.

208
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,830
Mio wasn't at school?

209
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,140
Please give this to her.

210
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,020
Okay.

211
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,110
Well, if you'll excuse me.

212
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,650
Take care.

213
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,930
Umm... are you...

214
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,210
No, it's nothing.

215
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,190
Sorry about that.

216
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,140
Good night.

217
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,950
Don't tell me she...

218
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,990
Elen!

219
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,460
My name is Ein.

220
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,900
I have no reason to lie to you anymore.

221
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,530
So... just call me Ein.

222
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,970
Lie? What are you...

223
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,560
I brought you a change of clothes.

224
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,740
Why?

225
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,270
Who told you to...?!

226
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,960
Drei did.

227
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,070
Drei?

228
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,220
Are you talking about... Cal?

229
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,110
She used to be called that, too.

230
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,940
What exactly are you guys...?

231
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,290
You heard from Drei, right?

232
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,710
Is that true?

233
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,960
Are you and Reiji really...?

234
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:13,860
Yes.

235
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:15,920
We're assassins.

236
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,040
No way...

237
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,120
There's no way that could be...

238
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:23,180
Sorry, but could you go home on your own?

239
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,680
You can call the police with this.

240
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,180
Bye.

241
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,540
Cal left.

242
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,190
She mentioned something about "putting an end to everything".

243
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,550
I think she's going to kill Reiji...

244
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,250
I know.

245
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,370
You do?

246
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,700
Then... that phone call from earlier...

247
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,580
You're going to fight her?

248
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,420
Isn't there... Isn't there something I can do?

249
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,170
I love Reiji!

250
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,250
I would do anything for him!

251
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,830
Is that not enough?

252
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,670
Can I not stay by his side?!

253
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,530
Your feelings for him may very well be real.

254
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:16,090
But those feelings alone are not enough to defeat Drei.

255
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:22,000
If I don't kill her, she'll kill Reiji.

256
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,530
The one who shall prevent that isn't you... but me.

257
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:33,470
If you really want to help Reiji, stay here for a little longer.

258
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,750
If you do that, the likelihood of Reiji surviving will increase.

259
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,050
Reiji...

260
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,930
Did Reiji...

261
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,260
No, you've got it wrong.

262
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,680
I'm the one who involved you in all this.

263
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:54,880
Reiji isn't someone who can put on a crying or laughing facade.

264
00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:00,260
If you happened to have seen his smile or his tears before,

265
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,260
they were real.

266
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,640
Ever since you called me Elen,

267
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,480
I've existed for the sole purpose of protecting you.

268
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,980
I want you to live...

269
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,510
I want you to continue living...

270
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:47,630
If you survive... that's proof that I lived, too.

271
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,670
We are...

272
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:55,190
...ghosts that cannot exist anywhere.

273
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,640
We are phantoms with no identity.

274
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:29,760
Hey, even if it's in my dreams...

275
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,760
...can't I at least have a miraculous redemption?
