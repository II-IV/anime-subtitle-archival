1
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,220
Please take me off of this mission, Ms McCunnen.

2
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,410
I have something important to do.

3
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,480
What if I said...

4
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,920
...there was something more important than that?

5
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:50,670
What is it?

6
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,380
It can't be...

7
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,250
Yes. This is your passport.

8
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:09,140
The real you... your past is written in it.

9
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,420
Ein.

10
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,120
Be careful.

11
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,130
I didn't know...

12
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,600
There's no way I could've known...

13
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,860
...about the twist of the fate that was waiting for us.

14
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,020
...about the future.

15
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,850
Go ahead and take a look.

16
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,850
Are you afraid of regaining your past?

17
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,870
I've been following the organization's orders to kill people.

18
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,220
Yes. You've had great achievements.

19
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:07,120
But I was able to kill them because I had no past and memories.

20
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:13,840
You've been following orders like a robot without feeling any guilt.

21
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:24,080
If you regain your original self,
you might be tormented by your sins.

22
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,220
You're afraid of that, aren't you?

23
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,870
But that's precisely why I want you to return to your former self.

24
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,860
With your own will.

25
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,780
With my own will...

26
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,130
The distance is 249 yards.

27
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,910
An intermittent strong wind is blowing from the south.

28
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:05,390
Return to your true self, and accept yourself as Zwei.

29
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,960
You're so selfish...

30
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,500
Your organization was the one that took away my memories.

31
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,890
And it was also the organization
that stained my hands with blood.

32
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,320
And now...

33
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,540
It's a change.

34
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,330
The organization will be reborn soon.

35
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,160
When that happens...

36
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,240
I want you to be there, Zwei.

37
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,470
But no matter how skilled you are,

38
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,880
I don't want a doll who only follows its orders.

39
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,020
I want a companion.

40
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,700
A dependable subordinate.

41
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,630
Someone who will follow me of his own will.

42
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,150
If I learn about my past...

43
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,480
I'm not confident that I can keep going as I am.

44
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,240
When that time comes...

45
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,810
My mission is to back up the raid.

46
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,510
The people in sight are my targets.

47
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,440
Which organization are they from?!

48
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,110
The lading...

49
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,780
A sniper?

50
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,740
We did it!

51
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,550
It's too early to say that, bro.

52
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,330
Just get the hell out of here!

53
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,080
All right!

54
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,030
Just to nail us down here...

55
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,770
You've got some guts.

56
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,530
Try reading your name.

57
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,970
Azuma...

58
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,490
Reiji.

59
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,540
Seems like you remembered it.

60
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,300
Right... I...

61
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,460
...was on a trip.

62
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,090
And then...

63
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,100
I've killed so many people with these hands...

64
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,780
Just because I wanted to live on.

65
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,040
I was better off not knowing it...

66
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,330
I told you, didn't I?

67
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,670
I don't need a puppet.

68
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,830
Wake up from your dream.

69
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,450
You'll return to being you.

70
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:41,730
Accept your past and your sins and face them with your own will,

71
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,940
Azuma Reiji.

72
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,570
Phantom?!

73
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,160
Damn you, Scythe!

74
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,360
What do you want me to do?

75
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,100
Follow me, Reiji.

76
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,050
With your own will.

77
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,380
There's someone who needs your help.

78
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,180
This is your home.

79
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,140
If you're willing to stain your hands with blood again,

80
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,560
and share your guilt with me,

81
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,060
I promise to show you a wonderful life.

82
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,440
However, I'm not forcing you.

83
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,320
You can make the other choice, too.

84
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,820
The other choice?

85
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,920
The other choice is...

86
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,380
Go back to Japan?

87
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,520
If that's what you want,

88
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,520
I'll make an exception.

89
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,190
You might doubt me,

90
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,710
but I'm serious.

91
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,360
I'll really allow you to go back to your hometown.

92
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:19,070
What I want is a subordinate with a solid will.

93
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,260
You idiot!

94
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,860
Why are you shooting your allies?!

95
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,050
This might be Scythe's order but stop acting like a puppet!

96
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,610
You can't escape!

97
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:44,520
Think about this.

98
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:49,350
That snaky bastard is just using you as a disposable pawn!

99
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,830
Go back...

100
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,000
...to Japan...

101
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,860
This is an important decision for you.

102
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,970
I'll give you some time to think about it.

103
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,960
Hello? This is the Azuma residence.

104
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,820
Hello?

105
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,000
Hello?

106
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:25,120
There's no way I could go back there.

107
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:30,660
Look for her!

108
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,070
That Scythe bastard betrayed us.

109
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,070
Did you hear how many people she killed?

110
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,820
We shall repay him suitably.

111
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,790
Of course, Phantom as well.

112
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,020
Ein? What are you doing here?

113
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,030
Did you come here to kill me?

114
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,110
What are you talking about?

115
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,860
You don't know anything?

116
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,300
Then hurry up and return to the organization.

117
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,170
You can still make it...

118
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,630
Ein!

119
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,250
Ein...

120
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,240
It's me.

121
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,280
There's been a sudden change of plans.

122
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,060
Scythe betrayed the organization.

123
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,990
He made Phantom attack Inferno's lading.

124
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,320
Of course he immersed immediately.

125
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,230
Phantom has escaped, too.

126
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,630
But luckily Lizzie shot her.

127
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,240
The organization is looking for those two with all their might.

128
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,160
They haven't found either of them though.

129
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,570
They suspect that you've deserted the organization, too.

130
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,200
But I can give you an alibi.

131
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,050
I guess you don't have any time to consider my deal.

132
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,330
Make a decision quickly.

133
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,920
Come to my side...

134
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:52,810
Or...

135
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,590
I'll tell you one thing.

136
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,380
Scythe and Phantom are our enemies.

137
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,320
If you're with them, the organization will...

138
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,900
The bleeding won't stop.
The bullet didn't pass through all the way.

139
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,630
I've got to take her to a doctor.

140
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,230
I can't...

141
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,720
The organization probably has connections to hospitals.

142
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,550
I have to do it.

143
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:04,480
Don't die on me, Ein.

144
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,480
We sealed off all possible escape routes.

145
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,260
They're literally birds in a cage.

146
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,590
No one can run away from the organization.

147
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,820
Not even Phantom.

148
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,870
Now, who will hunt the prey?

149
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,200
Don't die, Ein.

150
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,340
You still can't find them with so many people?!

151
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,230
Highway?

152
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,280
Seal it off.

153
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,630
God damn it! If I had just killed her there...

154
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,660
Clau, what about him?

155
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,040
Zwei?

156
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,410
He's Scythe's pet dog, too.

157
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,430
It's quite possible that he'd be on their side.

158
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,810
When that happens, Lizzie...

159
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,390
You...

160
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,200
...shall kill him.

161
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,380
Ein.

162
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,940
You know, Ein.

163
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,860
Ms McCunnen gave me my passport tonight.

164
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,410
My passport...

165
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,230
After that, I remembered everything.

166
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:25,050
About my hometown, my family...

167
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,230
I had a place to return to.

168
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,920
I even remembered my name.

169
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,510
My name is Reiji.

170
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,610
Azuma Reiji.

171
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:41,790
It's much better than a boring name like Zwei, right?

172
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,660
But for some reason...

173
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,890
I'm not really happy...

174
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,220
I'm no longer my old self.

175
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,710
I shouldn't go back there.

176
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,880
Can I only return to the organization?

177
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,940
Ein... we should both go back...

178
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,870
Scythe and Phantom are our enemies.

179
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:25,980
If you're with them, the organization will... kill you.

180
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,010
I can't!

181
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,180
If I go back, Ein will...

182
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,070
In that case...

183
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,430
I'll leave Ein here...

184
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,200
...and go back alone?

185
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:56,900
What's wrong?

186
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,500
Nothing.

187
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,660
Don't worry.

188
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,480
The wind.

189
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,070
Blue, white, and green.

190
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,770
That's all there is to it.

191
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,220
There's nothing else here.

192
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,110
But it's so bright there...

193
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,290
And the wind is blowing.

194
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,310
A very strong wind.

195
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,810
Ein.

196
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,610
Be careful.

197
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,120
You too.

198
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,610
Without having a name, we were just given numbers.

199
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,390
We were just used like pawns and abandoned.

200
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,210
This has to be a joke.

201
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,740
This has to be a joke!

202
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,660
This meaningless way of life has to be a joke!

203
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:18,970
Ein.

204
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,320
Ein,

205
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,310
I'm the only one who can protect you.

206
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,400
I won't forsake you.

207
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,580
I definitely won't hand you over to the organization.

208
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,910
Let's escape...

209
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,800
From this city...

210
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,840
From Inferno.

211
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,670
Reiji.

212
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,910
Let's escape together, Ein.

213
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,690
I'll give you a new name.

214
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,520
Not Phantom nor a number.

215
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,680
Your own name...
