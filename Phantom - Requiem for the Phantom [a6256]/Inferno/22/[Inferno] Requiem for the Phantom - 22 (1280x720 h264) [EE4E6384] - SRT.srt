1
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,570
Nice to meet you, Ein.

2
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,580
Or should I call you the Old Phantom?

3
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,120
But that's in the past.

4
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,280
At this moment,

5
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,810
Phantom is me.

6
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,740
The Scythe dude calls me Drei.

7
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,460
Ein, Zwei, Drei.

8
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,940
I don't think you need an explanation, right?

9
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,920
"Nice to meet you"? I see the title of Phantom has degraded.

10
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,950
You know, I could kill you whenever I want to.

11
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,030
But that wouldn't be fun, would it?

12
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,230
Finding you two. Driving you into a corner. Killing you.

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,880
These are the only things that have kept me alive for the past two years.

14
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,800
Being kept by that fucking Inferno.

15
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,690
So please let me enjoy myself.

16
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,350
I want to see you two being afraid and running for your lives.

17
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,680
And will that make you satisfied?

18
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,300
It would.

19
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,490
You should've seen Reiji's face when he saw me!

20
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,360
It was like he saw a ghost or something.

21
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,720
Next, hmm...

22
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,940
How about I kill you in front of Reiji?

23
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,220
What kind of face do you think he'll make?

24
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,750
Impossible.

25
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,460
Huh?

26
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,960
You met me first.

27
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,840
And I'll kill you right here.

28
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,190
You're well prepared.

29
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,420
Sacrificing yourself to protect Reiji?

30
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,450
That's so damn lovable!

31
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,200
You're the one that's lovable.

32
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,410
Huh?

33
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:52,410
You couldn't forget the fact that Reiji abandoned you, right?

34
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,920
You want to make him regret more. You want to bury him in sadness.

35
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,610
But he's not the Reiji you knew back then.

36
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,930
He threw away his past and lives for the present.

37
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,980
Your point?

38
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,310
You're just a ghost of the past.

39
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,900
If you stand in his way,

40
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,820
he will shoot you.

41
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,190
You talk as if you know him pretty well.

42
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,700
You just don't understand how strong-willed he is.

43
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,360
And the main character enters.

44
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,460
Elen, Cal, you have no reason to fight each other.

45
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,680
Did you hear that?

46
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,740
Ein, it seems like you're wrong.

47
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,320
Not yet.

48
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,910
The entire cast hasn't gathered yet.

49
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,040
Drive.

50
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,010
Yes, sir.

51
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,320
Shoot me, Reiji.

52
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,800
Stop it, Cal.

53
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,590
Didn't you already abandon me once?

54
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,370
One more time won't make a difference.

55
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,670
Cal...

56
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,120
Shoot.

57
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,030
However, I'll take this woman with me.

58
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,680
I'll take her with me to hell.

59
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,860
Cut it out, you idiot.

60
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,120
Jesus Christ, I knew this would happen.

61
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,120
Why are you in such a rush?

62
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,380
This doesn't concern you.

63
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,230
This is Japan, you dumbass.

64
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:03,790
Don't think you can just get away after shooting in broad daylight.

65
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,460
I don't give a shit.

66
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,010
Really?

67
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,710
Then shoot, Phantom.

68
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:17,480
But if you do that, I'll kill everyone in here including you.

69
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,780
Come on, you're first, Phantom.

70
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,470
Put down your gun and get the fuck out of here.

71
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,820
I have your back.

72
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,410
Bang!

73
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,310
Man, what a boring ending.

74
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,540
Cal...

75
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,410
She's your successor, Zwei.

76
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,620
And I'm her support.

77
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,020
Thanks to her, I don't feel alive every single day.

78
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,770
Thanks.

79
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,770
Indeed.

80
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,030
Anyway, the game of school is over.

81
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,320
The organization discovered your whereabouts.

82
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,180
Hurry up and go somewhere else.

83
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,830
And I'm sorry, but I don't have the confidence to stop that crazy bitch again.

84
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,500
All right. We'll hurry.

85
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,680
Lizzie...

86
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,420
Well, how should I put it...

87
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,750
Live in the present, Zwei.

88
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,190
For Clau's sake, too.

89
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,090
Were you going to shoot?

90
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,080
What about you?

91
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,690
I...

92
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:53,670
This girl and me... if you had to pick one of us...

93
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,910
When that happens...

94
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,610
There's no time left.

95
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,840
I'll secure the escape route.

96
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,260
During this period, we'll let Inferno handle Drei.

97
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,260
It's finally time to shuffle the deck.

98
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,300
Hurry up.

99
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,360
We're going to go without you.

100
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,150
I'm sorry!

101
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,650
Come in.

102
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,630
Excuse me.

103
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,630
Boss, you've got a call.

104
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,750
Who is it?

105
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,490
Well, he calls himself Claudia's confidant.

106
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,510
This is Shiga.

107
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,300
It's been two years, Shiga Toru.

108
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,760
Who are you?

109
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,560
I've already introduced myself.

110
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,580
Claudia McCunnen's confidant?

111
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,230
That Asian brat that was always by her side.

112
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,160
If I remember correctly, it's the assassin...

113
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,520
Phantom.

114
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,660
Correct.

115
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,420
I hear you're being hunted down by the organization.

116
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,890
What do you want?

117
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,990
Does Shinokura High School ring any bells?

118
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,540
Shinokura...

119
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,990
Correct.

120
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:31,550
The school that the daughter of Godoh Kaiten goes to.

121
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,610
Hey, you know what the fuck you're doing?

122
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,410
You're touching something that you're not supposed to!

123
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,180
Don't worry.

124
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,240
As long as nothing happens to us, we won't lay a hand on Mio.

125
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,110
As long as nothing happens to us that is.

126
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,560
What do you mean by that?

127
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,580
Inferno's assassin is after me right now.

128
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,880
And I want you to stop her, Shiga Toru.

129
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:59,460
Put pressure on the Inferno presence in Japan with your authority.

130
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,750
Stop messing around.

131
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,790
It's up to you whether you do it or not.

132
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,200
This has nothing to do with her!

133
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,070
Just do your best.

134
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:18,070
So you became an actor, too.

135
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,410
I'm nothing compared to you.

136
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:24,140
If this works out, we can gain enough time.

137
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,100
Shiga's a sharp guy.

138
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,430
It'll be fine.

139
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,320
He'll definitely do as we say.

140
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,030
If this doesn't work out...

141
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,800
If that happens, we'll think of other plans.

142
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,360
I don't want to endanger Mio.

143
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,520
Are you happy that Drei is still alive?

144
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,970
Yeah.

145
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,970
I thought she died on that day.

146
00:10:54,580 --> 00:11:00,890
I thought I killed her by getting her involved with what happened back then.

147
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,350
But she's still alive.

148
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,560
Tomorrow, I'm going north at daybreak.

149
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,520
There's a smuggling freighter.

150
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,820
I'm going to go and negotiate.

151
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,600
Alone?

152
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,680
Yeah.

153
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,700
You stay with Mio.

154
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,020
Let's go home!

155
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,430
Look at the time.

156
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,340
I'll make dinner as soon as we get home!

157
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,170
Hey, Phantom!

158
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,820
I just received orders from the higher-ups.

159
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,880
Fuck off!

160
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,070
So it seems like you've heard about it already.

161
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:47,640
The Godoh Group's godfather - Godoh Kaiten's secret child.

162
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:55,650
It seems like those two didn't become students because they felt like it.

163
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,940
I don't give a fuck about Japan's yakuza!

164
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,820
Calm down, Phantom.

165
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,450
The Godoh Group is also an official part of Inferno.

166
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,500
That's right.

167
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,940
If the Godoh princess can't be safely secured,
there's no way to kill them.

168
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,780
We were deceived by Zwei.

169
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,300
I guess this is it for now.

170
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,550
We'll wait for the next chance.

171
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,550
Fuck!

172
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,420
Bodyguard for a high school student?

173
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,140
Yeah.

174
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,600
Who the hell is she?

175
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,340
You don't need to know.

176
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:36,060
But to me and to the Group,
 she's an extremely important person.

177
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,650
Is there a need to deploy us?

178
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,070
Yeah.

179
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,670
Use your lives to protect her! Got it?!

180
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,660
Yes, sir.

181
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,230
Do you hate him that much?

182
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,220
No shit.

183
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:58,250
Why the fuck do you think I've been listening to the orders of this shitty organization?

184
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,590
It's because I want find and kill him.

185
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,090
That's all.

186
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,760
To be honest, I'm relieved.

187
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,690
Huh?

188
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:21,050
I don't think I can bear to watch you and Zwei fight, Cal.

189
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,120
So you're underestimating me.

190
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,000
You think I'd lose?

191
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,820
That's not it.

192
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,530
It's true that he lied to a lot of people two years ago and messed around with them.

193
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,940
I was also a victim.

194
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,830
That's because he's a fraud.

195
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:43,120
But you were the exception.

196
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,720
Zwei protected you.

197
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,800
He's been lying to me this whole time.

198
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,480
He never told me anything.

199
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,750
He covered up his lies with more lies.

200
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:03,730
He was just scared of the moment when he wouldn't be able to keep me in the dark anymore.

201
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,450
He lied in order to protect you.

202
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,630
Protect?

203
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:17,500
The only one he ever wanted to protect was himself.

204
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,050
See, he abandoned me in the end.

205
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,480
And ran away with another woman.

206
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,570
Even so, that can't be your reason to be an assassin.

207
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,920
You're not being one because you want to, right?

208
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,610
I am.

209
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,820
Right now, I'm the great Phantom who can even make a crying brat shut up.

210
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:48,700
Gangs who own the streets will shiver when they hear my name.

211
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,600
Feels good man.

212
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,450
Kicking those bastards around, tormenting them, killing them.

213
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,750
You can't have a better life than this.

214
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:05,580
He's afraid of me.

215
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:11,260
He realized that I would become too strong.

216
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:18,520
I'll definitely pay him back for lying to me and using me.

217
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,730
Cal, you're just like burnt-out fireworks.

218
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,870
Elen's absent today?

219
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,040
Yeah, she's had a fever since last night.

220
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,920
It might just be a cold though.

221
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,770
You should've told me that sooner!

222
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,300
I could've gone to your house and taken that cold away from her!

223
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,730
Sup!

224
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:52,790
I see you're talking about boring stuff as usual, you idiots.

225
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:53,590
Shut up.

226
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:58,930
By the way, we're going to a movie today and I'm allowing you guys to come too.

227
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,980
Is that how you invite someone?

228
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,480
Mio's coming, too.

229
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,120
Sorry, I'll pass.

230
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,650
I have something to do.

231
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,620
Could it be a date?

232
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,500
Good guess!

233
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,130
So, they ditched us.

234
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,890
It seems like it.

235
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,310
Why did Sanae say everyone's going?

236
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,000
What a way to beat around the bush.

237
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,490
Yeah.

238
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,840
I hope Elen gets better soon.

239
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,720
Let's go to a movie.

240
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,690
I'll just be a bother to Elen if I go home.

241
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,190
Sure!

242
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,700
This situation is convenient.

243
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,430
As long as I move around with Fujieda Mio,

244
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,880
Shiga will be pressured.

245
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,600
I was fooling around like a kid. It's embarrassing.

246
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,710
That movie was pretty good.

247
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,060
We should thank Sanae.

248
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,200
I think you're...

249
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,340
...a mysterious person.

250
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,360
How should I put it...

251
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,380
Your views are different from those of normal people.

252
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,540
What do you mean?

253
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:49,540
What's ordinary and normal to us...

254
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,260
...is something that you treasure dearly.

255
00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:00,760
That's why when I look at you, I fall in love with the present.

256
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:08,980
Even if it's something boring, it has its own significance.

257
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,480
It's just that everyone has forgotten about it.

258
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,070
Am I intruding?

259
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,090
Reiji-san...

260
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,810
So she's Fujieda Mio.

261
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,820
Ein, me, and the princess of the Godoh Group.

262
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,900
You use each and every woman that gets close to you.

263
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,770
You don't even have any intentions of harming her.

264
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,610
Cal...

265
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,960
Now, let's continue our match.

266
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,990
There can be only one true Phantom.

267
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,980
You're Phantom, Cal.

268
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,970
Right now, I'm just a student.

269
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,880
Don't make me laugh, Zwei.

270
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,670
Are you that type of person?

271
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,590
If you want my life, then I'll give it to you.

272
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,260
Why were you escaping up until today?

273
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,770
You didn't want to die. You just wanted to keep living. Wasn't that it?

274
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,200
If you kill me, I'll gladly accept that as punishment.

275
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:35,900
I did something that merits you killing me.

276
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,860
However, I have a condition.

277
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:47,110
After taking my life, I want you stop hunting Elen-... Ein.

278
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,950
You want to be her scapegoat?

279
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:57,720
She won't be a threat to Scythe or Inferno anymore.

280
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,130
So...

281
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,910
You want to protect her even if you die.

282
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,270
After abandoning me...

283
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:12,310
I can't believe you have someone else that's so important to you.

284
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,230
No, Cal...

285
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,350
Back then, I was...

286
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,600
I'll kill you as you wish.

287
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:34,250
However, I'll continue to torture you and make you feel pain before I kill you.

288
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,290
Reiji-san...

289
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,850
We are...

290
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:55,370
...ghosts that cannot exist anywhere.

291
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:58,700
We are phantoms with no identity.

292
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:28,390
If you can't shoot me here, you're too naÃ¯ve.

293
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:33,220
It's only natural for you to die here.
