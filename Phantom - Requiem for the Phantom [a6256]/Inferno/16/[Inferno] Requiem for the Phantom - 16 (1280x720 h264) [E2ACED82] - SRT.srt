1
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,170
You bastards...

2
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,840
What? What happened?

3
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,900
There's another sniper...

4
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,080
No way...

5
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,430
Where?

6
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,120
Where did he shoot from?

7
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,370
Don't tell me...

8
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,330
Mission completed.

9
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,440
Very well. Withdraw via route C immediately,

10
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,880
and wait for instructions.

11
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,630
Yes, Master.

12
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,350
A shot that didn't hit anyone but stirred up mistrust.

13
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,620
Now, how will the heroine improvise her way out?

14
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,380
You called us all the way out here to get shot.

15
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,400
What the fuck is this?!

16
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,780
You guys will pay for this, right?

17
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,130
What are you talking about?!

18
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,120
Weren't you bastards the ones who shot?!

19
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,370
Oh? Then...

20
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,290
Kill them all!

21
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,490
You can't, Mr. Godoh!

22
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,110
You scared me...

23
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,870
Ray...

24
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,480
I... I...

25
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,150
Wanted to...

26
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,110
There's another sniper.

27
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,710
But...

28
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,720
Reiji...

29
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,560
Reiji!

30
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,730
What's wrong?

31
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,780
Nothing, let's retreat.

32
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,070
I see. All right.

33
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,990
My subordinate has successfully erased the threat.

34
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,710
There's no need to worry about snipings anymore.

35
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,180
What they hell are you playing at?

36
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:47,780
Mr. Godoh, I present to you Issac Wisemel's head.
The head of the person who has been plotting to kill you.

37
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,220
What did you say?

38
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:56,100
This traitor, who only cares about personal profit, was killed by me.

39
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,290
Traitor?

40
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,110
Can you give me an explanation?

41
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,800
A reason for shooting our own people.

42
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,140
This sniping was plotted by Wisemel.

43
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,120
If you confirm the identity of the sniper who my subordinate stopped,

44
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,620
that would be unshakable evidence.

45
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,130
Nice set-up.

46
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,380
This is the Inferno way of settling things.

47
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,760
The hotel sniping occurred after I killed Randy.

48
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,550
That wasn't part of Wisemel's plan.

49
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,520
There was another sniper.

50
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,020
That sniper was also Wisemel's subordinate.

51
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,920
He's the type that's extremely determined.

52
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,490
Then why did the sniper only fire one shot and didn't continue to fire?

53
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,870
Wisemel's objective should have been to kill Godoh Daisuke.

54
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,520
You sound like you're the only one who knows the truth.

55
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:04,380
Killing or not killing... didn't matter.

56
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,340
That sniper's true objective was...

57
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,560
...to stir up mistrust between the two groups there.

58
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,730
To mess up Inferno from the inside.

59
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,740
Did they even predict that Claudia would kill Wisemel?

60
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,310
Stop.

61
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,280
The whole thing is a conspiracy stirred up by that bastard Wisemel.

62
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,920
That's why Clau finished him off according to her own judgment.

63
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,810
Don't think too much.

64
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,450
We're just soldiers.

65
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,700
There's no point in thinking that deep.

66
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,260
Lizzy's correct.

67
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,790
We don't need to know the truth.

68
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,900
Besides, if Wisemel takes the blame for everything that happened,

69
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,740
the whereabouts of the 5 million becomes clear.

70
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,840
The money that the Godoh Clan lost...

71
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,110
...will appear in Wisemel's mansion.

72
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,460
This will put an end to everything.

73
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,300
The deaths of the yakuza, avenging Judy,

74
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,120
and...

75
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,740
...my very own assumption.

76
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,750
No.

77
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,740
That's not it.

78
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:38,770
She can't be alive...

79
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,120
Hey, I heard some rumors.

80
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,820
Is it true that Issac of the Bloodies died?

81
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,820
Yes, it is.

82
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,830
The person you killed was Issac's man and also the one who killed Judy, right?

83
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,580
Yeah.

84
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,670
Then avenging Judy is done...

85
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,180
I see.

86
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,550
Hey, so how was it?

87
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,460
How was my assassin training?

88
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,190
If it's fine with you, I can help you with your assassinations from now on.

89
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,130
No more assassinations.

90
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,770
No more...

91
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:41,240
Then does that mean I'm fired?

92
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,220
However...

93
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,670
I wouldn't want to miss your cooking.

94
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,040
For the time being, I'll let you be my kitchen maid.

95
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,760
Really?! Yay! A maid!

96
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,970
I've always wanted to try that!

97
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,050
Maid clothes are really cute, aren't they?!

98
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,760
You don't need to go that far.

99
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,040
Eh?! No maid clothes?!

100
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,850
No.

101
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,300
I guess it's okay as long as I can stay by your side.

102
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,600
What a fabulous report.

103
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,280
This sums up that Issac Wisemel was behind everything that happened.

104
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,380
The Godoh Clan has no reason not to consent to this.

105
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:31,920
However, to be able to see through all this in the middle of such chaos...

106
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,300
You really are excellent.

107
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,600
You'll be taking Issac's place from now on.

108
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:46,890
Then...

109
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,770
Don't disappoint me, Claudia McCunnen.

110
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,300
Understood.

111
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,210
Potential?

112
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,900
Yes. She has a rare quality about her.

113
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,420
You could call it talent.

114
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:22,470
Talent... I've heard such words before.

115
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,980
So you mean you want to train that girl into a hitman?

116
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,200
Yes.

117
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,310
If she doesn't show any results...

118
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,320
You know what to expect, right?

119
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,840
Yes.

120
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,820
Then let's see what she's made of.

121
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,830
There won't be any more dangers now.

122
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,770
I should find an excuse and...

123
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,500
...send her off...

124
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,800
But yet,

125
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,180
I feel at ease when I'm here.

126
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,620
Cal.

127
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,120
I'm going out.

128
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,370
I might be coming back the day after tomorrow.

129
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,730
I probably should have told you earlier.

130
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,260
No, don't worry. Have a good trip.

131
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,840
Be careful, okay?

132
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,850
You too.

133
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:53,090
Seems like you're already used to the office work.

134
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,420
Stop joking around.

135
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,830
How about just spending your days like this?

136
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:02,570
You're already an executive.
There's no need to wander around.

137
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,250
It still hasn't ended.

138
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,180
This is just the beginning.

139
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,220
What else do you need?
Being too greedy will do you no good.

140
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,490
Well, I know you won't listen.

141
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,400
But be careful where you tread.

142
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,110
Do I seem that much of an idiot to you?

143
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,330
Just let me give you some advice. It's my hobby, after all.

144
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,430
Cal, I didn't really get it...

145
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,980
Is this the full one you-

146
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,590
Cal.

147
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,190
Welcome back! You're home already?

148
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,890
Cal, where did you go?

149
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,750
You bought it!

150
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,200
Chicken served with this is really good.

151
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,720
Should I just let this go on?

152
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,890
Should I...

153
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,340
Reiji.

154
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,510
What's up?

155
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,270
You know,

156
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,780
I really want to become your assistant.

157
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,560
Cal, that's...

158
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:47,390
I know that you don't want me to become an assassin.

159
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,740
Because you know the pain of an assassin.

160
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,620
But I want to become useful.

161
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:03,660
Being weak, being poor, and not being able to do anything without relying on others.

162
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,090
I'm tired of living like that.

163
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,260
Cal, you can walk whatever path you want. Do whatever you want...

164
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,700
But why do you want to become an assassin?

165
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,810
Do you hate assassins?

166
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,730
Yeah.

167
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,770
Does that mean you hate yourself too?

168
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,830
Yeah, I do.

169
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,790
Killing is like my second nature and I can't go back.

170
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,210
That's why I hate myself.

171
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,990
But Reiji...

172
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,030
I'm already broken.

173
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,160
Do you want to become like me?!

174
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,900
Sorry Reiji... I...

175
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,400
Cal, I said too much.

176
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,380
Sorry.

177
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,410
But it's true.

178
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,600
I don't know how many have died because of me.

179
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,120
If I weren't there, they would still be living.

180
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,690
They could have all gone back to their families and lovers.

181
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,730
It's not your fault.

182
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:33,680
You just accepted a job that was going to be done either way.

183
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,510
It's not as pretty as you described...

184
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,290
Then, do you really want to kill?

185
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,070
Do you shoot just because you want to kill?

186
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,150
Do you like to kill?

187
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,870
You don't, right?

188
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,870
You feel bitter, full of pain, sad, and unforgiving to yourself for doing such things.

189
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,230
You want to kill yourself.

190
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,590
You don't pull the trigger simply like the people that killed Judy.

191
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,560
You live while enduring it all.

192
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,130
That's why you won't make mistakes.

193
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,260
You won't kill the innocent.

194
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:24,600
If those guys back then had been you, then Judy wouldn't have had to die.

195
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,190
But Cal...

196
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,990
When you kill your first person, the whole world changes.

197
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:39,630
Everything you see... everything you hear... everything changes.

198
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:46,620
You won't be your kind self anymore.

199
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,640
I don't want you to become like that.

200
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,240
This isn't where you belong.

201
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,260
You shouldn't come into the world that I'm in.

202
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,380
But... But you'll always stay in there, right?

203
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,090
If I go there, then I'll always be able to stay with you.

204
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:10,900
Cal...

205
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,420
I don't want to leave you...

206
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,630
I want to stay by your side forever.

207
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,910
I want to help you.

208
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,340
I just...

209
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,750
...want to be with you.

210
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,750
I get it now. I...

211
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,260
...really do want to go back.

212
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,270
By doing that, I can stay with you.

213
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,080
There's no need. I'll go to your world.

214
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,600
I'll go to where you are.

215
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,210
Let me go... Let me go back...

216
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:05,490
Back to the world where you are.

217
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,720
Cal, I was like a dead person before I met you.

218
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,100
If we get split up, I'll turn into a dead person again.

219
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:36,580
I'll forget how to laugh and cry.
The things you made me remember.

220
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,650
Don't tell me, this guy is...

221
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,610
Do you know him?

222
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:48,370
There's no doubt about it. It's that brat!

223
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,690
I was shocked.

224
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:56,100
Ms. McCunnen should've been helping you people join Inferno.

225
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,630
Where was the plan changed?

226
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,370
How would I know?!

227
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,450
Contact the boss immediately! Hurry!

228
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,300
Yes, sir!

229
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,820
Your turn should be over soon, Ms. McCunnen.

230
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,960
Let me give you a flower that's suitable for the end.

231
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,530
Hello?

232
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:27,520
Phantom, can you dispatch right away?

233
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,120
Why so sudden?

234
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:33,270
The remnants of the Bloodies are making some weird movements.

235
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,750
I want to settle it without causing a ruckus.

236
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,910
Can you help me?

237
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,100
All right. Where do we meet?

238
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,850
The usual train station at 20:00.

239
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,090
Understood.

240
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,250
Work?

241
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,350
Yeah.

242
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,360
I thought we would be together for the whole day...

243
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,240
What are you talking about?

244
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,240
Aren't we going to be together forever from now on?

245
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:08,740
Huh?

246
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,990
We have plenty of time.

247
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,470
I need to regain my own self.

248
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,930
For Cal's sake,

249
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,040
and...

250
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,760
Elen's sake.

251
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:27,980
Don't call me Elen. I'm Ein.

252
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,730
No matter now or before. I'm just Ein.
