1
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,790
Romero...

2
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,950
I wonder if you would have looked as peaceful as he does...

3
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,130
...had you been raised in a different country.

4
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,180
You were still here, Lizzie?

5
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,320
Aren't you going to Mexico tomorrow?

6
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,480
I figured I'd nail you down before I leave,

7
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,570
to make sure you behave yourself while I'm gone.

8
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,140
Who is that?

9
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,450
He's quite handsome, isn't he?

10
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,470
I can't really tell Asians apart.

11
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,040
All I know is that they all look so carefree.

12
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,070
Does he look like someone who could kill?

13
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,480
You're joking, right?

14
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,500
He probably couldn't even harm a fly.

15
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,830
Yeah.

16
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,700
You'd think so, right?

17
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,010
Good. You're getting the hang of it.

18
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,990
A knife is both a shield and a weapon.

19
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,970
And that's why...

20
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:18,140
A close combat fight between two knife wielders will be decided by whoever can parry the other's knife.

21
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,580
You were going easy on me?

22
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,460
What good will binding do when your opponent's still armed with a knife?

23
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,810
An FBI Agent was found dead this afternoon in Tijuana, Mexico.

24
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,210
Learn the words using your eyes and your ears.

25
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,020
Mexican authorities have officially declared this case a homicide,

26
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,390
and have commenced investigations in the area.

27
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:49,400
American authorities have identified the terrorist group Noche de Sangre as potential perpetrators,

28
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,760
Nothing...

29
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,890
based on the group's recent expansion activities in South America.

30
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,470
She's going to kill again.

31
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,630
How is Zwei coming along?

32
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,060
His technical skills have almost reached full potential.

33
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,760
Just in time.

34
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,180
Come here, Ein.

35
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,240
Yes, Master.

36
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,350
No one can see through you.

37
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,530
Encompassed beneath your soft, white skin.

38
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,460
The dangerous weapon that lies within.

39
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,990
Ready your gun.

40
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,720
Ein, you are perfect.

41
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,590
I created you and I raised you.

42
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,430
You are a perfect specimen.

43
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,910
I want to preserve this perfection to the end of time.

44
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,590
Model Zwei into perfection...

45
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,320
...with your hands.

46
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,260
Make him as perfect as you are.

47
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,660
Yes, Master.

48
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,900
This is your final step before reaching absolute perfection.

49
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:12,460
Bequeath your perfection unto the next generation, Ein.

50
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,800
Yes, Master.

51
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,780
I thought you'd be back earlier, Ein.

52
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,770
Come.

53
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,660
We need to get you ready.

54
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,960
How much longer are you going to make me wait?

55
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,450
Don't you realize how important I am to your organization?

56
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,950
I've been diverting the military's arms to you for many years,

57
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,620
regardless of all the danger that it's brought me.

58
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:02,610
Your achievements are quite commendable, Lieutenant Juarez.

59
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,540
But this was quite an unexpected turn of events.

60
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,810
I couldn't help it.

61
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,160
I got caught up in the killing while I was on leave, you know.

62
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,340
That's quite unfortunate.

63
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,270
It appears that the victim was an FBI investigator.

64
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,390
An acquaintance of yours, perhaps?

65
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,400
I've got nothing to do with them.

66
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,920
They're suspicious of me for some reason.

67
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,520
I see.

68
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:34,480
If I get interrogated, you guys will also be in hot water.

69
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,120
Therefore, Inferno has an obligation to protect me.

70
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,620
But of course.

71
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,820
Rest assured that you will be looking at a Caribbean sunset in just a few hours.

72
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,200
I sure hope so.

73
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,140
Choose the gun you're most comfortable with.

74
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,980
Are we practicing again?

75
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,730
No, tonight will be... a test.

76
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,020
A test?

77
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,570
Follow me.

78
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,780
I thought we were going to an airport.

79
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,280
What's going on?!

80
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,710
What are you people trying to-

81
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,070
Mr. McGuire,

82
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:14,130
allow me to introduce Lieutenant Juarez, U.S. Navy.

83
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,970
A member of Inferno?

84
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,570
Looks like she's carrying a high caliber automatic.

85
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,160
She must be a bodyguard.

86
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,540
I'm asking what the hell is going on!

87
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,650
This guy...

88
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,130
You were being too greedy.

89
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,760
Things wouldn't have gotten out of hand if you had stuck to selling weapons only to us.

90
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:48,790
Instead, you decided to sell arms to terrorists as well, and now you're marked by the FBI.

91
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,310
We at Inferno place the highest priority on keeping a low profile.

92
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,360
You betrayed me-

93
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,340
Scythe.

94
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,260
Inferno has decided to give you a chance to save yourself, Lieutenant Juarez.

95
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,130
Please run away.

96
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,180
We'll give you a ten minute head start.

97
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,920
After that, we will send someone to hunt you down.

98
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,050
If you can get away, you win.

99
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,580
I hope that's satisfactory with you.

100
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,990
Absolutely.

101
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,390
There's an armory inside that building.

102
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,750
Feel free to take whatever you want.

103
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,250
What are you up to?

104
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:37,250
All we've done is pave the way for you to earn your freedom and your right to live.

105
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:41,010
Is that not the greatest glory that exists for a soldier such as yourself?

106
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,070
Is this how you repay me for everything I've done for you?!

107
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,270
You guys really call yourselves-

108
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,470
I don't think you should be wasting your time here.

109
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,770
Damn it!

110
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,970
You've heard the situation.

111
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,730
Here's your first mission, Zwei.

112
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,540
Kill that man.

113
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,750
It doesn't matter how. Just get it done.

114
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,970
Wait.

115
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,180
I'm not-

116
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,070
Your training is complete.

117
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,700
You've done well.

118
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,210
You were an excellent student.

119
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,260
We're confident that you'll do well.

120
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,730
None other than Inferno's almighty Phantom is acknowledging your skills.

121
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,550
Have confidence in yourself.

122
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,680
Confidence?

123
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,270
How can I be confident in killing someone?

124
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,710
Go, Zwei.

125
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,440
I can't.

126
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,770
How can I?

127
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,500
I'll let you decide one last time.

128
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,920
Will you accept everything that's happened and survive,

129
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,760
or will you deny everything and die?

130
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,360
Do you really think he'll be all right?

131
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,510
He's up against a Navy SEAL, isn't he?

132
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,770
It shouldn't be a problem.

133
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,510
I've asked you all the way out here

134
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,510
to demonstrate just how capable he truly is, Mr. McGuire.

135
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,150
What kind of weapon is he carrying?

136
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,620
When you're the hunter, think as if you're the prey.

137
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,950
When you're the prey, think as if you're the hunter.

138
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,890
Your opponent will also be trying to think ahead.

139
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,590
So...

140
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,930
What's your opinion of this, Phantom?

141
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,740
Lieutenant Juarez is a professional who has received formal military training,

142
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,040
and his field experience far outweighs that of Zwei.

143
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,440
But Zwei is far superior in terms of reflexes and concentration,

144
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,470
provided that he's able to clear his mind.

145
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,820
Your conclusion?

146
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,100
They're evenly matched.

147
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:59,370
Their respective potentials will probably determine the outcome of this match.

148
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,430
What are Zwei's odds of winning?

149
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:04,620
I don't know Lieutenant Juarez's abilities, so it's tough to say.

150
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,410
Wait! Don't shoot!

151
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,620
I'm unarmed!

152
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,450
Just hear me out.

153
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,740
I don't know why they're making a kid like you do this,

154
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,960
but just think about it!

155
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,790
We have no reason to kill each other.

156
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,800
Do you have a family?

157
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,180
I have a brother who's much younger than I am.

158
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,060
All I wanted was for him to live freely.

159
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,560
If you can spot one rat, there are at least thirty more nearby.

160
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:08,070
A man who's lied once will lie again and again.

161
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,120
I've been flirting with danger all my life,

162
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,780
but I was finally able to pay for him to enter college.

163
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,560
I, at least, want to support him until he graduates.

164
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,270
A craftsman always carries many tools.

165
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,200
The same applies to killing.

166
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,170
Inferno is using both of us.

167
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,670
They're the bad guys, not you.

168
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,680
I thought the winner would have been decided within two shots.

169
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,950
What do we do if that boy loses?

170
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,290
Where there's a will there's a way.

171
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,200
Would you prefer to wait inside the car just in case?

172
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,890
Yes.

173
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,310
Playtime's over.

174
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,560
I've seen plenty like you.

175
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,900
Ones who don't have the balls to pull the trigger.

176
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,430
And now, allow me to teach you...

177
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,490
...precisely how to kill someone.

178
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,990
Does it hurt?

179
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,840
Killing someone...

180
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,500
...isn't something just anyone can do.

181
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,880
Don't think that I'm done with you, yet.

182
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,770
Your lesson is just beginning.

183
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,980
Zwei.

184
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,710
That wasn't bad for your first kill.

185
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,710
Why?

186
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,410
Why?

187
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,720
Wasn't this all supposed to be a dream?

188
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,250
I told you.

189
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,380
It's going to be a long one.

190
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,740
This is just the prolongation of the dream.

191
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,450
A dream that will not end until you either lose yourself,

192
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,510
or die.

193
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,030
Do you want it to end?

194
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,870
It's up to you.

195
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:35,590
Abandon your eyes, your ears, and even your heart.

196
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,620
And simply become Zwei.

197
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,240
See everything through Zwei's eyes.

198
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,430
And hear everything through Zwei's ears.

199
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,260
Once you do, you will know no fear,

200
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,460
and know no sadness.

201
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,080
You will be at peace with yourself.

202
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,190
My name...

203
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,970
My name...

204
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,920
...isn't Zwei.

205
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,240
I guess it's not after all.

206
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,930
What do you want me to do?

207
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,960
End it...

208
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,310
...all of it.

209
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,170
You are no longer who you once were.

210
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,180
Stand up, Zwei.

211
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,330
Zwei.

212
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,820
Where did you find a boy like him?

213
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,680
He was recommended to us by a certain group in Japan.

214
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,720
I see.

215
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,120
So you mean to tell me that talent is hidden even in a tamed country like Japan?

216
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,670
Yes.

217
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,030
You passed the test.

218
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,900
You are now a member of Inferno.

219
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,710
You are what I used to be.

220
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:32,180
You know both my despair and my pain.
