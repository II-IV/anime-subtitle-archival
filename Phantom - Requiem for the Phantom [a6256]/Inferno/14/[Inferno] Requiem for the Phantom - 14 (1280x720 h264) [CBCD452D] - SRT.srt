1
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,940
Cal, what are you doing?

2
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,340
Cooking. Can't you tell?

3
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,610
What did you use to make it?

4
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,400
Those.

5
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,540
Just try some.

6
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,700
I used to cook for Judy every day.

7
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:03,970
It's good.

8
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,310
I know, right?

9
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,440
Then I took an even more expensive pot down from the shelf,

10
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,090
and I handed him a fifty dollar bill.

11
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,470
The face the shopkeeper made was hilarious.

12
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,860
You know, then...

13
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,000
So you mean you want to train that girl into a hitman?

14
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,440
Cal.

15
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,320
What is it?

16
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,620
Do you know how to use a gun?

17
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,430
Yeah.

18
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,260
"Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?"

19
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,830
That was an Eastwood reference.

20
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,230
Oh, and also...

21
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,280
I'm being serious here.

22
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,530
In other words, this is related to avenging Judy.

23
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,430
Let me make it clear.

24
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,970
Five million isn't enough.

25
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,490
Really?

26
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,220
But you only need a little more.

27
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,200
You could make it even by yourself.

28
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,000
What should I do?

29
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,900
Become my assistant in the meantime.

30
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,350
I know how you feel.

31
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,470
But...

32
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,720
Wow!

33
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,220
Wow! I'm going to become Phantom's assistant?!

34
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,500
Hey...

35
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,910
Come on, don't worry.

36
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,520
Hey, so if I become your assistant,

37
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,950
I'll be able to see the moment when Judy gets avenged with my own eyes, right?

38
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,460
Before that, there's something you need to get.

39
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,650
What's that? A new gun?

40
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,780
New clothes.

41
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,430
Let's go buy some tomorrow.

42
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,840
You're going out?

43
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,490
Yeah, work.

44
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,960
Then, can I...

45
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,450
Your mission today is to wait here.

46
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,490
But that's so boring!

47
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,670
Work is supposed to be boring and not enjoyable at all.

48
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,540
Be a good girl and wait.

49
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,910
Fine...

50
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,430
Five million were stolen and four men were killed.

51
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,220
On top of that, it was in your territory.

52
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,310
Even so, you're not going to apologize or compensate?

53
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,390
I offer my condolences for the deceased ones,

54
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,440
but we're not going to shoulder any responsibilities for incidents that occurred before our deal was completed.

55
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,720
You bitch...

56
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,900
Muroto.

57
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,200
However, it's true that our business has been interfered with.

58
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,140
We'll do whatever we can to find out who was behind it.

59
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,580
So you'll be able to take back the money, right?

60
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,430
That's included too.

61
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,050
I hope you will stay in Los Angeles until the conclusion is reached.

62
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,590
Of course, we can guarantee you a pleasant stay.

63
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,730
But originally...

64
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,280
Our money was stolen.

65
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,380
Our men were killed.

66
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:36,190
I doubt we'd be able to go back to Japan empty-handed.

67
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,270
Hey, Shiga, let's extend our vacation.

68
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,030
How are we going to explain this to the boss?

69
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,240
Just say we're not acclimatized.

70
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,750
The one behind this is Isaac Wisemel.

71
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,550
Wisemel?

72
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,520
There's no evidence that the details of our deal got leaked.

73
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,010
It was done by someone from within.

74
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,380
But Wisemel is also a victim.

75
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,500
You're right.

76
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:16,180
No one would think that he'd start trouble in his own yard for a measly five million dollars.

77
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,390
He planned it out well.

78
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,410
Wisemel's goal is to stop the
Godoh Group from joining Inferno.

79
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,120
He probably doesn't want to see me gain such a huge backing.

80
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,910
That's too coercive.

81
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,540
Do you think he became an executive with his rude mouth?

82
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,030
He's the type of guy who forces things when it's needed.

83
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,690
He'll definitely target the Godoh Group again.

84
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,330
Then just ask them to go back to Japan-

85
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,510
That'll be troublesome without bait, won't it?

86
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,480
We're fishing for a shark.

87
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,680
The Godoh Group is the bait, and you're the hook.

88
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,160
Yeah, it turns out we have to stay here.

89
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,160
We need you to stay with us for a little longer.

90
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,820
Understood.

91
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,760
This is just a backup plan in case something happens...

92
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,960
Leave the pointless talk for later.

93
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,040
The wine is losing its taste.

94
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,960
I'll contact you again.

95
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,470
I hope you have an enjoyable vacation.

96
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,200
I finally found a coordinator that has no link with Inferno.

97
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,570
That Giuseppe guy?

98
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,250
If he really knows everything about the underworld,

99
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,860
then it's pointless to plan the whole thing out.

100
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,480
That's true, but...

101
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,960
Whatever, just drink.

102
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,660
It's a gift from Inferno.

103
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,510
This booze is thirty years old, Shiga.

104
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,210
All right, I'll drink with you.

105
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,420
Bait, huh?

106
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,070
Reiji!

107
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,470
Everything was OK at the base!

108
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,020
You shouldn't say that out loud.

109
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:22,480
Sorry!

110
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,420
So is this part of the pleasant stay you mentioned?

111
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,840
What do you think?

112
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,720
Don't worry.

113
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,350
I meant it when I said "I can't go back empty-handed".

114
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,980
It seems like you have dissatisfied subordinates though.

115
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,170
You mean Shiga?

116
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,080
Don't worry.

117
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,220
He was just voicing some ideas.

118
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,990
That's his job.

119
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,450
I see.

120
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,780
You should worry about yourself.

121
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,450
It hasn't been going well recently, right?

122
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,330
Just as you said.

123
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,400
No matter what country you're in,
trying to live in the underground is the same.

124
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,050
However,

125
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,440
3000 people of the Godoh Group will be protecting you soon.

126
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,470
How reliable.

127
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,640
Have you decided yet?

128
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,610
Hold on.

129
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,470
It's already been two hours.

130
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,470
But I don't know...

131
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,220
There's nothing you want?

132
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,010
No, there's a lot!

133
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,150
Then...

134
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,960
Even though I have a lot I want...

135
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:36,230
If you ask me to pick one, I don't know which one to pick...

136
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,650
Just pick the one you want most.

137
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:45,040
But I want all the clothes here equally.

138
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,330
If I just picked one, I'd have to give up the others, right?

139
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,520
Don't worry.

140
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,780
This isn't the only chance that you'll get to shop.

141
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,670
I'll bring you here again if there's something else you want.

142
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,300
Really?

143
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,000
Yeah, so pick a set of clothes you want to wear today.

144
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:11,500
Then...

145
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,930
Just to tell you, we won't be coming here every day.

146
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,060
I know!

147
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,650
Do you really?

148
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,590
Hey, hey, is it cute?

149
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,330
Does it look good on me?

150
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,830
Yeah, it looks really good on you.

151
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,710
This is my first time wearing such light clothes!

152
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,510
Reiji! Hurry!

153
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,690
Go back on your own.

154
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,890
A SIG Sauer, huh?

155
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:01,830
It's the same as the Beretta you're using now. 9mm, 15 shots.

156
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:07,180
But this one has a smaller build,
since you said she hasn't used a gun before.

157
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,840
This should do.

158
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,320
I'll give it a try.

159
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,750
Thanks.

160
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,580
So?

161
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,930
Huh?

162
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,670
I doubt you came here just to give me a gun I never asked you for.

163
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,600
That girl Cal was mentioned in today's executive meeting.

164
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,810
Was it Wisemel?

165
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,550
Even worse, McGuire.

166
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:37,070
He said he wants to see how much she's grown.

167
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:44,150
You should at least teach her how to use a gun.

168
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,390
Welcome home, Reiji.

169
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,090
Oh, you changed already?

170
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,240
Those clothes are for going out.

171
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,090
This is enough to wear inside.

172
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,590
Yeah, that's good enough.

173
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,700
We'll begin firearms training now.

174
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,350
Really?

175
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,380
Is this the training ground?

176
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,930
I haven't been here for a while.

177
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,290
Such a lonely place.

178
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,020
Let's begin.

179
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:36,860
Hold it properly with the right amount of force.

180
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,880
Right hand out and left hand supporting.

181
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,880
Yeah. Just like that.

182
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,240
Use the sight to aim at the target.

183
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,640
Can you see it?

184
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,400
My hands are shaking...

185
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,600
Use your fingers, not your arms.

186
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,270
Good, that's it.

187
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,230
Pull the trigger slowly.

188
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,130
You rushed it.

189
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,860
Do it slower, like you're squeezing something.

190
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,700
I hit it! I hit it!

191
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,880
Did you see that, Reiji?

192
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,350
Yay!

193
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,860
Try reloading it.

194
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,270
Her reloading is cautious and well done.

195
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,780
All right, try practicing by yourself.

196
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,180
Lonely place, huh?

197
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,000
What do you want from me?

198
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,990
So? What do you want from me?

199
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,850
Who are you talking to, me?

200
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,070
OK.

201
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,930
You're dead.

202
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,930
I missed...

203
00:15:59,070 --> 00:15:59,990
Cal.

204
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:06,430
You know, um... That was a De Niro reference...

205
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,230
Do that again.

206
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,070
Do that De Niro or whatever reference again.

207
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,130
What do you want from me?

208
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:17,380
So-

209
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,700
Cut the dialog.

210
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,450
Next time, don't shoot immediately.

211
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,670
Strike your pose, stop for one beat, and then shoot.

212
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:25,810
All right.

213
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,460
I hit it?

214
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,720
Yay! I hit it!

215
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,640
Yes.

216
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,790
Are you ready to fish for the shark?

217
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:47,630
The Godohs are tired of sitting and waiting.

218
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,700
They plan on going out and having some fun tonight.

219
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:56,150
Your mission is to watch over them and catch Wisemel in the act.

220
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,050
All right!

221
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,060
I'm not even close...

222
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,070
How easygoing can they get?

223
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,300
All right!

224
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,110
Today isn't my lucky day.

225
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,440
Don't be so depressed.

226
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,020
You'll never get the Goddess of Victory if you don't have confidence.

227
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:56,300
She's already opened up for you,
so what's the point of me trying to get her?

228
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,710
You're giving up?

229
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,740
This is the only thing that won't betray me.

230
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,810
Don't drink too much now.

231
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,330
Why can't they act like Japanese and stay together?

232
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,970
Shiga-kun!

233
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,330
Yes, Bro?

234
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:36,290
Hey, does the mafia really control this place?

235
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,360
No way...

236
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,340
This isn't a De Niro movie.

237
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:47,060
That girl is probably a genius.

238
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,060
But should I let her walk the same path as me?

239
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,600
No, I should set her free as soon as possible.

240
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,320
Let's go play poker.

241
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:10,000
Umm...

242
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yes?

243
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:15,020
My friend was supposed to be here.

244
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,750
Oh, the Japanese guy?

245
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:23,760
It seems like he returned to his room with a young woman.

246
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,430
Got him.

247
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,220
Don't tell me...

248
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,540
Elen?

249
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,880
No, it can't be her.

250
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:28,920
Elen is dead...

251
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,200
She was killed by me, so...
