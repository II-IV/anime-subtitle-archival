1
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,990
Judy...

2
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,810
Don't mind her, Cal.

3
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,410
She's probably just out of booze again.

4
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,440
Well, I'll be off.

5
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,590
I should be back by morning as always.

6
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,730
Be careful.

7
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,390
Over there!

8
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:11,610
Phantom!

9
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,220
It's Inferno's...

10
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,030
...Phantom!

11
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:02,380
Just in the past year, more than 20 important figures have fallen victim to this mysterious purge.

12
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:09,430
These murders are being called "Phantom Assassinations", and are striking terror into the hearts of the U.S. underworld.

13
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,520
Looks like that lady's doing this the flashy way as usual.

14
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,270
It's not a laughing matter, bro.

15
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,360
It could be us on the news tomorrow, you know.

16
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:47,140
Belacruz, who was a substantial Number Two of the Gambino household, is no longer there.

17
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,140
The Gambinos have nothing left.

18
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,640
The East Coast is ours now.

19
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,100
This is all thanks to Phantom.

20
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:05,690
Our previous Phantom astonished us as well, but that boy is something else, Claudia.

21
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,740
It's almost frightening how much he's accomplished.

22
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,500
It's a wonder that you were able to tame him up to now.

23
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,210
I didn't tame him.

24
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,710
His devotion to Inferno is his own will.

25
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,080
Oh, really now?

26
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:33,100
I've always thought that he was trying so hard because he wanted to get to those tits of yours.

27
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,100
By the way, Mr. McGuire...

28
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,630
The investigation for that group is now complete.

29
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,190
The Japanese organization that's going to be joining us, right?

30
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,200
They've reclaimed their own market in Japan, and are making quite a bit of a profit.

31
00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:01,550
But their Southeast Asian dealer, who was the
source of their products, suffered a deadly blow.

32
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,430
The Godoh Group currently has no products in stock.

33
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,180
If we establish a business relationship with the Godoh Group right now,

34
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,430
we will control the monopolistic export of products to Japan.

35
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:28,240
This weekend I've made a deal for 5 million dollars with
Mr. Daisuke Godoh, the young head of the group.

36
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,410
As a means of a friendly gift, for starters.

37
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,410
Now wait just a second.

38
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,770
Why are you suddenly in charge of the negotiations, too?

39
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,370
What about our say in this?

40
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,220
That's enough.

41
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:44,880
But...!

42
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,230
If she's able to carry out the negotiations smoothly,
I don't see why we should find someone else for the job.

43
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,370
Then that's exactly what I'll do.

44
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,580
Good work.

45
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,050
Say, don't you think you've been pushing yourself too hard lately?

46
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,320
You think so?

47
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,910
I'm sure you've got something in mind,

48
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,710
but if you give too much support to one organization, you'll end up having to carry extra burdens.

49
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,840
I'll be fine. Everything is going well.

50
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,550
That was fast.

51
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,390
I've returned,

52
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,060
Ms. McCunnen.

53
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:44,320
Lizzie told me what happened in New York, Zwei.

54
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,020
Sounds like it was a success.

55
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,000
Thank you.

56
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,580
I'll prepare a ride right away.

57
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,990
Would you care to drive?

58
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,280
I'll leave it to you.

59
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:02,000
Looking good, Phantom.

60
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,520
How was New York?

61
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,900
It was cold. Nothing special.

62
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,170
Isaac was saying earlier that you're only playing the role of Phantom for my body.

63
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:43,000
I could see him saying something like that.

64
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,590
Was he right?

65
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,870
Who knows.

66
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,090
If I ever had reasons... I've forgotten them.

67
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,760
That's right. Who really cares?

68
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,850
You're here out of your own will.

69
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,710
You're here out of your own will.

70
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,080
Yeah right...

71
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,080
I don't have a will.

72
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,810
I don't have anything right now.

73
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:56,320
But soon, like me, you won't be able to feel anything.

74
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:02,080
There's nothing for us in the past or the future.

75
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,220
It was exactly as you said, Elen.

76
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,150
Your handling's a bit stiff.

77
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,700
You can't blame me when 25kg of cocaine is your customer.

78
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,410
Only the two of us?

79
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,420
The whole purpose of this deal is to get to know and trust each other.

80
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:55,420
It wouldn't quite work if we brought along a lot of people with us, would it?

81
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,100
I see.

82
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,230
And so, who are they?

83
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,060
They're people from your homeland.

84
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,810
Those yakuzas, huh?

85
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,540
This is where we're doing the trade?

86
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:25,230
This place has always been a territory of the Bloodies.

87
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,440
Isaac Wisemel's gang.

88
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,910
That's right.

89
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,920
No one would pull something stupid in this area that might get them in trouble with the Bloodies.

90
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:40,130
So it's the safest place for Inferno.

91
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,640
Is that them?

92
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,220
They're not giving us a signal.

93
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,660
Something's up.

94
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,710
Zwei?

95
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,180
Stay in the car.

96
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,040
The guy behind this was working alone.

97
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,490
His weapon was a silenced pistol, and...

98
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,400
...a large knife.

99
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,120
So while his opponents were disoriented in the darkness, he killed them one by one.

100
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,030
He's pretty good.

101
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,370
I told you to stay in the car.

102
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,390
What's going on?

103
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:11,600
Looks like there won't be a deal tonight.

104
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,500
Who would have done this?

105
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,720
Who knows.

106
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,090
There's no point in thinking about it here.

107
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,860
Head back without me.

108
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,610
I'll be back right away.

109
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,610
Where are you going?

110
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,190
Dealing with the aftermath.

111
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,440
Sounds like you brought all sorts of trouble into my territory.

112
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,050
What do you have to say to that?!

113
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:46,320
The patrolling brats are all charged up,

114
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,660
and the dealers and women are scared out of their minds which is killing my business!

115
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,780
You really screwed up my territory, didn't you?!

116
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,120
How about you say something, Claudia?!

117
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,120
What, are you trying to avoid your responsibility, Mr. Wisemel?

118
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,620
What?

119
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,380
It's your responsibility to protect your own territory.

120
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:12,060
My customer was robbed of 5 million dollars and four men in your territory.

121
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:17,750
I want you to rethink who should be getting cursed at right now.

122
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,020
You bitch, do you really think you're allowed to talk to me like-

123
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,900
This is painful to watch.

124
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,610
Claudia, how is the Godoh Group taking this?

125
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,360
They're certainly not happy,
but they're still under control.

126
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,760
Great.

127
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,750
I'll leave their reception to you.

128
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,390
Butter them up to the best of your abilities.

129
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:39,420
We have to reimburse a customer's money as quickly as possible.

130
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,530
Along with the heads of the thieves who stole it.

131
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,070
That's your job, Isaac.

132
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,250
Hang on a second!

133
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,260
You're saying that those Asians are customers?!

134
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,070
I haven't agreed to this yet.

135
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,170
This is a matter of dignity.

136
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,980
The people who came to Inferno for help were assaulted.

137
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,530
It doesn't matter whether they're customers or beggars.

138
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,080
You're saying that we should allow something like that in front of your doorstep?

139
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,040
Fine.

140
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,080
I'll see what I can do.

141
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,220
It's a battlefield in there as usual, huh?

142
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,470
We've identified the body.

143
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,470
Her name is Judy Devens. 26 years old.

144
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,000
Apparently she was an old-timer in that area.

145
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,430
No connections to anyone.

146
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,980
She never relied on a mediator, and worked alone.

147
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:50,850
What about her room?

148
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,460
I took a look.

149
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,990
No guns, no knives, nothing.

150
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,440
It seemed like she had a roommate,
but we have no idea where she might be.

151
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,500
Is there something on your mind?

152
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,720
Lizzy, I'll leave this place to you.

153
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,310
Geez, you sure have a lot of requests.

154
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,890
Whatever, go ahead.

155
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,390
Both the police and the media should have left by now.

156
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,420
Is this where Judy Devens passed away?

157
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,620
Who are you?

158
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,010
Seriously, who are you?

159
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:34,280
And what about you? A friend of Judy's?

160
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,310
You were Judy's friend too, huh?

161
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,260
I'm her younger sister.

162
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,880
What, is it wrong to have so many sisters?

163
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,350
Not at all.

164
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,940
Who killed Judy?

165
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,480
How should I know?

166
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,990
Not even the faintest idea?

167
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,490
Are you saying that she had a reason to be killed?

168
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,490
That was thoughtless of me.

169
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,300
Wait!

170
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,970
What are you going to do if you find the person who killed her?

171
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,720
I'll make him pay dearly for killing Judy.

172
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,470
You're saying you can do that?

173
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,480
I guess so.

174
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,570
Then...

175
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,190
If that's true...

176
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,800
Take me with you!

177
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,980
I can help you!

178
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,090
No.

179
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,050
I know who killed her!

180
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,970
I saw it all.

181
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,970
I was here with Judy last night when she was shot!

182
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:16,180
I went to pick her up because she was drunk,
and we were on our way home.

183
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,320
But then, Judy was trying to protect me, and...

184
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,530
Please, could you take me along?

185
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,290
What's your name?

186
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,990
Cal.

187
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,650
Cal Devens.

188
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,540
What about you?

189
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,120
My name is...

190
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,060
Azuma... Reiji.

191
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,720
Oh, so you're Japanese.

192
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,740
All right, Reiji!

193
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,350
From now on, we're partners.

194
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,760
Partners?

195
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,570
That's right.

196
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:55,030
We're one in mind and flesh, with a sole goal: to avenge Judy's death.

197
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,520
I promise I'll be useful in some way.

198
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:02,990
Sounds good.

199
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,460
From here on, we're partners.

200
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,490
It'll probably only be for a little while, though.

201
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,750
She was such a small girl.

202
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,540
And I...

203
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,300
...continued to sin.

204
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,110
Someone like me, whose life had been screwed up.

205
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,140
Inside that whirlpool...

206
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,900
...I screw up people's lives.

207
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,000
What... should I do?

208
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,190
Where should I go?

209
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,840
What's... going on?
