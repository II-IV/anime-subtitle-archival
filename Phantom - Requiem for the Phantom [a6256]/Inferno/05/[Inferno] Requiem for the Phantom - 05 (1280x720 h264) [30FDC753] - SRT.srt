1
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,060
I thought I told you, Sam.

2
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,780
Melanie Square doesn't need hard drugs.

3
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,060
Please wait, Mr. Tony. I didn't have a choice!

4
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,480
Ben told me to sell them no matter what.

5
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,150
I don't give a shit why you did it!

6
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,340
This is my turf... the Stone Family's turf.

7
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,640
I'll show no mercy to those who can't follow my rules,

8
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,820
even if they're the President or the First Lady!

9
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,950
That's enough.

10
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,670
Old man Gant...

11
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,170
I'll take him. You don't mind, do you?

12
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,420
Suit yourself.

13
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,430
You're old fashioned as always.

14
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,930
You're probably the only mafia family in L.A. that doesn't allow hard drugs these days.

15
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,390
I just want Melanie Square to be a decent place to play.

16
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,360
We've got enough money. We don't have to bend our principles to make more.

17
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,770
Don't talk so big, you novice.

18
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,070
You don't even live by the sweat of your brow.

19
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,060
You're right about that.

20
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,830
Hardheaded Tony, huh?

21
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,590
Daddy!

22
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,110
Duke! I didn't know you were here.

23
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,970
Sorry to show up so suddenly, Tony.

24
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:22,550
Eva.

25
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,560
We came to the Square to see a movie, so...

26
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,160
Daddy, you didn't forget, did you?

27
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,730
We're going to the amusement park together the day after tomorrow.

28
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,090
Yeah, of course I remember.

29
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,300
How could I forget about a day where I get to hang out with you?

30
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,070
Yeah!

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,320
Tony, can I have a moment?

32
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,210
That guy again?

33
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,210
It's about time we settle this.

34
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,100
If he won't comply, teach him a lesson.

35
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,600
Yes sir.

36
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,100
Ms. McCunnen, this is Richard Harrington.

37
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,380
I'm hoping to get a favorable response from you tonight.

38
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,110
We're giving you the best deal we can offer.

39
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,160
I see. Well, it's not a bad deal.

40
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,230
But my response is the same.

41
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,460
Why is that?

42
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,910
Don't make me repeat myself.
Melanie Square is our family's turf.

43
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,330
Everyone who lives here... Everyone who works here...

44
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,280
They're all my family.

45
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,630
I won't betray them.

46
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:43,010
You heard the man. So go back and tell your boss.

47
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,720
Or do you want to take a few bullets and go back in a body bag?

48
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:52,640
It seems that you guys still don't realize Inferno's true power.

49
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,880
What'd you say?!

50
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,460
We'll give you three more days. This is your last chance.

51
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:05,650
I trust you'll change your mind, Tony Stone.

52
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,740
What an annoying prick!

53
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,750
How can he be so confident?!

54
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,840
Even if it was a bluff, it's creepy.

55
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,800
Lutz, Rob. Do a thorough investigation on who's behind Inferno.

56
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,400
It's hard to believe that they're just some new organization.

57
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,540
Yes sir.

58
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,700
Are you ready?

59
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,170
Whenever you are.

60
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,550
Even if you block your opponent's weapon once, it doesn't end there.

61
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,120
I see.

62
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,050
That's impressive.

63
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,650
You couldn't do anything at first, but you can hold your own now.

64
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,650
That's because I've got a good coach.

65
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,590
There are two missions that I'd like you to carry out.

66
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,620
Will you accept?

67
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:18,920
Two?

68
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,330
I'll explain at my place. Come with me.

69
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,830
Your place?

70
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,350
So this is where you live, Ms. McCunnen?

71
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,410
That's right, though it's a little too big for a single person with no family.

72
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,070
Lizzie's been recruited for a different case today, so...

73
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,190
To get to the point, please explain the details of those missions.

74
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:13,180
First, I want you to be my guard and keep me company tonight.

75
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,640
I told you... Lizzie is out.

76
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,680
Even though the security here is perfect,
I want someone around just as a formality.

77
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,690
Why does a high-ranking executive like you have only one bodyguard?

78
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,400
Do I need someone else?

79
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:39,700
And the second mission is to monitor a mother and her child.

80
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,930
Okay, if that's your order.

81
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,590
That's not good.

82
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,730
You're not a doll.

83
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,770
Why you have to monitor them...

84
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,870
Why it is important...

85
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,470
You need to ask those things, okay?

86
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,220
What do you mean you can't get a clear picture about Inferno!?

87
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,890
We've asked information brokers and others all over the place,

88
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,150
but each of them say something different.

89
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,640
One would say the Verrocchio Family is involved,

90
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,730
while another one would say it was the Cervantes Family.

91
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,740
And of course, I heard the Bloodies' name as well.

92
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,740
What the hell is that?!

93
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:23,270
Lutz, since when did you start letting people sell you a bill of goods?!

94
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,800
I apologize.

95
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,260
Cut it out, Anton.

96
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,240
They did their job.

97
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,750
What do you mean?

98
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,940
Extending their power in a short time...

99
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,770
Doing things in various ways...

100
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,040
Their executives who don't show themselves...

101
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,450
And the information Lutz and Rob got...

102
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,090
If we put them all together, we'll get the answer.

103
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,770
Inferno is a special organization that is connected to the mafia families on the West Coast.

104
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,530
What?!

105
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,780
That guy's confidence also comes from that.

106
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,460
The only way for us to survive is to kiss up to them.

107
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,250
He knew that from the start.

108
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,680
Boss, then Melanie Square will be...!

109
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,980
Not in my book.

110
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,910
No matter who we're facing,
I can't betray the people of the Square!

111
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,980
Anton, set up a meeting with Inferno immediately.

112
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,270
But give them a condition.

113
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,270
Tell them to bring their boss.

114
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,480
Tony... don't tell me you're going to...

115
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,490
I'll negotiate, at least...

116
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:45,280
The real boss probably won't show,
considering their organization system.

117
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,530
But that's okay.

118
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,750
It'll be enough to pick a fight with them.

119
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,290
But if we do that, they'll definitely retaliate against us.

120
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,760
He's right. Not just the Square,
but your family will be in danger too!

121
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,600
I'll leave them to you.

122
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,940
Make sure you keep them safe.

123
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,770
I'll teach them that we're too troublesome to swallow.

124
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,230
Then, depending on how they react,
the mother and her child will have to be...?

125
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,570
That's right. Even if that's the case...

126
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:19,740
...will you be able to do it?

127
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,710
Tell me... Don't just take orders...

128
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,210
Tell me your answer.

129
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,420
Come on! Hurry up!

130
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:16,800
Coming.

131
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:20,920
Thank you.

132
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,550
No problem.

133
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,170
Looks like you're getting used to it.

134
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:33,060
In order to blend in with a flock of sheep, you have to wear sheep skin.

135
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,390
What were the characteristics of the fifth to last person that we passed by?

136
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,280
A white male in his twenties.

137
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,440
He was wearing a Dodgers cap and a black shirt.

138
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,580
Based on how he was talking on his cell,

139
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,940
he got separated from a friend and is trying to find a place where they can meet up.

140
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,790
Correct.

141
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,860
Even when wearing sheep skin,
a wolf shouldn't forget his sense of smell.

142
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,790
That's also something you taught me.

143
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,490
Hey, hold on.

144
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,770
Okay, got it. Buy it for him.

145
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,780
Well then, Duke. See you later.

146
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,810
Okay, Daddy.

147
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,060
Tony, please be careful.

148
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:46,430
Anton said that everything is ready.

149
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,220
Let's go.

150
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:58,230
What're you hardheaded guys doing all dressed up tonight?

151
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,980
Old man Gant... I don't think it has anything to do with you.

152
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,910
Don't do anything that would hurt the citizens, got it?

153
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,660
If you do...

154
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,690
I know.

155
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,060
Your residence is thoroughly guarded by Abel and Bark.

156
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,690
That place is the safest place in LA tonight.

157
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,700
What about Inferno?

158
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,160
They'll be here soon.

159
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,010
So it's okay to have you handle it, Ms. McCunnen?

160
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:33,910
Yes. We have to think about the future too, so I'll represent Inferno at the meeting.

161
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,900
I appreciate your thoughtfulness.

162
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,690
My feelings are a bit mixed though,
being the one in charge of this district.

163
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:44,770
I'd like to make Melanie Square ours without turning it into a battlefield.

164
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,400
I'm counting on you, Ms. McCunnen.

165
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,590
You needn't worry. If one has two trump cards,

166
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,430
they can win most games.

167
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,920
Rob just called and said that the meeting is about to start.

168
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,280
I see...

169
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,810
Please don't worry.

170
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,710
So far, things have been quiet around here.

171
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:19,490
So long as nothing happens tonight, the game is ours.

172
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,180
Yes...

173
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:00,110
I didn't expect a babe like you to be an Inferno executive.

174
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,180
Many people get surprised.

175
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,530
I sure hope you aren't just a decoration.

176
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,190
I thought we told you to bring your boss.

177
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,650
I won't say that I'm the head of Inferno.

178
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:16,210
However, I've been given full authority with regards to this case.

179
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,590
She's right.

180
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,700
Please refrain from speaking rudely to her.

181
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,710
Back off from Melanie Square.

182
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,520
You think we'd just agree to that?

183
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,110
We'll pay the debt later on.

184
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,320
That's the code of conduct among mafia, is it not?

185
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,960
You won't have to. All we want...

186
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,470
...is Melanie Square.

187
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,690
Those at the Square are all people who were driven out from other places and live in obscurity.

188
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,900
They are inept and cannot live anywhere else besides the Square.

189
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:57,160
Even so, they're our family.

190
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,670
I can't betray our family.

191
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,210
That's against my principles.

192
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,050
Old-fashioned and hardheaded.

193
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,380
You're just like your nickname, Tony Stone.

194
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:15,170
Could you still say the same thing if I told you that your real family was in danger?

195
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,300
If you do that, you'll lose everything, too.

196
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,680
Is that okay with you?

197
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,920
I'll ask you once more.

198
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,900
Will you hand Melanie Square over to Inferno?

199
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:43,870
No.

200
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,680
You're late, Phantom.

201
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,530
What the hell?!

202
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,190
Duck! It's a sniper!

203
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,910
Shoot back! Kill the sniper!

204
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,290
We can't! He's too far!

205
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,180
Zwei, you're up.

206
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,250
What?! What about the Boss?!

207
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,350
Is he okay?!

208
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,120
The negotiations were broken off.

209
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,940
Boss and Anton are all right, but Rob and Lutz were...

210
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,330
Oh no...!

211
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,760
In any case, please go stay with Duke.

212
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,680
Okay.

213
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,990
They're... crazy...

214
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,490
Inferno!

215
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,490
Mommy!

216
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,500
Duke, haven't you gone to bed yet?

217
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,290
You see, the guy I saw at the amusement park is...

218
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:54,790
What?

219
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,630
Eva! Eva!

220
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,570
Fantastic.

221
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,550
You're... fantastic.

222
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:27,590
Being a tool... Being a device...

223
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:32,180
All we need to do is function.
