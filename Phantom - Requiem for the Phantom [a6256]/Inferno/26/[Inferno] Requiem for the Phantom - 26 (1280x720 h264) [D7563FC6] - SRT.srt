1
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,080
I will kill.

2
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,710
In order to live...

3
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,120
I will kill.

4
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,030
Elen...

5
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,820
Are you ready?

6
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,080
It has begun, Mr. Shiga.

7
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,230
This is what I've been searching for.

8
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,260
The play you've written will definitely backfire on you one day.

9
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,420
And you'll go to hell, Scythe Master.

10
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,500
That sounds rather interesting.

11
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,510
Now, my fellow creations,

12
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,960
sing and dance...

13
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,950
...in this murderous and blood-thirsty world!

14
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,650
Who are these girls?

15
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,570
There's no one else in this world with such twisted tastes.

16
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,730
So they're the same as us.

17
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,350
There are at least two more of them.

18
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,510
Sounds bad.

19
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,850
Not true.

20
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,130
Apart from these girls, there shouldn't be any more assassins from Inferno.

21
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,610
Why do you think so?

22
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,700
That person won't allow unrefined stage props to appear on the stage.

23
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,790
He plans to draw the curtains himself?

24
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,960
This is the final battle.

25
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,940
Neun and FÃ¼nf left the stage?

26
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,640
They're putting up quite a fight.

27
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,530
This wasn't part of my scenario.

28
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,560
That's right.

29
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,520
There isn't a better ending scene than this.

30
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,080
Let's go.

31
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,170
I'll bait them.

32
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,150
Use this chance to find Scythe.

33
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,360
The rest will be easy after killing their commander.

34
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,430
You're the only one who can understand his intentions.

35
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,000
Be careful.

36
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,360
You too.

37
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,740
2 on 1.

38
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,740
Oh?

39
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,750
So you're here...

40
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,720
Ein.

41
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,600
Welcome to my stage!

42
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,740
I won't act on your stage.

43
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,470
Only two are here?

44
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,420
Don't tell me the others are...

45
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,560
Are you going to surrender?

46
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,070
No, I'm here to kill you...

47
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,230
Master.

48
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,670
Kill me?

49
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,210
That's interesting.

50
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:16,120
How are you going to kill me when you're on the verge of despair?

51
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,710
There's no way I'm scheduled to die in this scene of your play.

52
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,970
You do not wish to see such a boring ending.

53
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,830
I never thought you would've understood so well.

54
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,160
It's just as you said.

55
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:44,110
The reason why I returned to this island-country is to see the co-acting of my daughters.

56
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,450
Let me introduce you.

57
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,970
These two are Sechs and Sieben.

58
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,320
You can acknowledge them as your younger sisters, Ein.

59
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:58,660
That's Ein, your prototype.

60
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,390
Have a little fun with her.

61
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,170
And when she reaches her limit,

62
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,920
slowly skin her and scrape her flesh off.

63
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,630
What's wrong, Ein?

64
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,160
You can't step back anymore.

65
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:43,150
Even though I went easy on you, you can't even fight back.

66
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:44,920
How boring.

67
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,910
Their thoughts, actions and even breathing...

68
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,750
...are exactly the same as how you trained me.

69
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,470
That's right.

70
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,760
Ever since the moment you created me,

71
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,880
nothing has changed.

72
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,780
Relying on you even till the end...

73
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,520
I'm sorry, Cal.

74
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,960
My, my.

75
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,090
This is surprising.

76
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,760
I never thought you would have such fighting strength in you.

77
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,820
I told you already.

78
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,230
I'm here to kill you.

79
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,450
But that's impossible for you.

80
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,580
Why?

81
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,270
Because I surrender.

82
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,200
Why?

83
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:11,690
That means I'm not a threat to you anymore.

84
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,920
So? Can you still kill me, Ein?

85
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,520
This is the difference between you and Zwei.

86
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,660
Compared to Zwei who can kill under his own intentions,

87
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:30,000
you can only kill under orders.

88
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,610
If you go against that, your heart will sink to darkness.

89
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,940
The horror and guilt of killing will swallow you.

90
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:45,820
Your will-less mentality is even weaker than that of a normal person.

91
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,150
You won't be able to shoot me.

92
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,920
That's right, it's impossible for you.

93
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,160
Because... you need me.

94
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,360
Thank you for bringing me such an enjoyable night, Ein.

95
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,180
Elen...

96
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:21,380
You really are a foolish person.

97
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:26,360
Do you really think you can see through everyone?

98
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,160
Of course.

99
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,130
I will kill you.

100
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,690
Because...

101
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,910
I hate you.

102
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,340
I'll never forgive you for hurting him.

103
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,750
What will come of killing me?

104
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,690
Others will come and kill you.

105
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,380
You won't find your memories.

106
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,630
You're just walking in a spiral with no end.

107
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,390
Even if that's true...

108
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:03,780
I can kill you right now, Scythe Master.

109
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,870
Beautiful...

110
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,360
That's beautiful, Ein!

111
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,870
Don't call me Ein.

112
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,760
My name is Elen.

113
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,670
I will live the life that he wished for.

114
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,170
Elen...

115
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,470
This is a prank by the Muses.

116
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,760
Please go to hell first.

117
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:34,750
I still want to stay with him for a little longer.

118
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:13,360
Let's go, Elen.

119
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,650
Oh?

120
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,250
So Scythe Master and the Phantoms...

121
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,720
How should we deal with it?

122
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:31,210
Those who destroy old systems and create new ones are the young ones.

123
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:35,760
Flowers that fade away... Ghosts that don't exist.

124
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,340
Even if it's just a fleeting dream,

125
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:44,990
we have things we must do.

126
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,090
What's going on here?

127
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,470
Seems like something happened at the chapel and the old school building.

128
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,870
How scary...

129
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,230
Have a safe trip,

130
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,050
Reiji.

131
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,990
Helmut von Giuseppe. Born in Berlin.

132
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,090
Doctoral degree in psychology and brain physiology.

133
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:33,110
Active as an expert in the fields of interrogation and brainwashing.

134
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,630
After that, he entered the underworld and wandered from place to place.

135
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,720
He then became the middleman for freelance assassins.

136
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,250
His nickname in the underworld was Scythe Master.

137
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:52,460
In order to search for Elen's past, we must research that man's background.

138
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:57,970
She met Scythe and began her life as Ein,

139
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,190
five years ago.

140
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,150
Their encounter took place in Hong Kong.

141
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,440
Really?

142
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,170
This man came to this orphanage?

143
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,240
Yes, around five years ago.

144
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,490
He said he wanted to adopt a girl from Ulan Bator.

145
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,080
Adopt a girl...

146
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,750
She was a girl with milky white skin.

147
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,580
If she's still alive, she'd probably be the same age as you two.

148
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,400
This might be my imagination...

149
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,640
But the girl over there looks exactly like her.

150
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,080
Ulan Bator.

151
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,540
We came to Mongolia.

152
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,970
But we couldn't find any more clues.

153
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:49,570
Go to the grasslands and look up to the sky.

154
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,080
You'll definitely find out that way.

155
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,860
As long as you look up, you will understand.

156
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:05,990
We're here.

157
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,650
If you are a child of Mongolia, you will never forget the sky.

158
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:46,210
The sky and the clouds will be engraved into your flesh and bones.

159
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,160
As long as you look up, you will understand.

160
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,670
I don't think we need to go on anymore.

161
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,930
Are you sure?

162
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,790
I'm sure.

163
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,740
I remember this sky.

164
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,650
I've seen it countless times in my dreams.

165
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,810
Seeing this is enough.

166
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:41,240
In my wrongful life where I couldn't fulfill any promises,

167
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:44,720
there is still a promise I want to fulfill.

168
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,690
There's no need to search for my memories anymore.

169
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:55,230
Even if I can't find them, I already have the name you gave me.

170
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,980
That is to make you smile.

171
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,200
I have memories of being with you.

172
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,270
To find your true smile.

173
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,020
One day, I will...

174
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:37,020
These memories... These memories are enough for me to continue living.

175
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,690
These memories are enough for me.
