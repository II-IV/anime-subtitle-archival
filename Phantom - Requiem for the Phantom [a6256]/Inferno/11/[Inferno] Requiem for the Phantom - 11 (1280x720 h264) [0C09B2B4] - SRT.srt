1
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,230
Where should I go?

2
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,930
I don't even know where I came from.

3
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,650
I don't have any memories.

4
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,170
How can I become free?

5
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,860
A freedom I can attain through murder...

6
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,280
What is it?

7
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,440
Smile.

8
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,940
Please smile, Elen.

9
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,830
Just give it to the police.

10
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,550
I'm counting on you.

11
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,160
Wait!

12
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,980
I'll be killed if I don't run.

13
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,090
I can't escape from those black eyes.

14
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,030
If you don't want to die...

15
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,790
...come at me with all you've got!

16
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,430
You were born with a talent.

17
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,360
A talent to kill people.

18
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,470
A talent to survive.

19
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,480
A talent for being an assassin.

20
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,930
You have to be reborn if you want to live.

21
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,970
Your existence is only allowed as long as you kill people.

22
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,540
What is the path that we must walk?

23
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,090
Being a tool.

24
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,040
Being an instrument.

25
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,050
We just need to function.

26
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,220
We can't think about anything unnecessary.

27
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,690
"I'll erase an inexperienced young man's memories and make him an assassin."

28
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,150
I agreed to Scythe's reckless plan.

29
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,280
Because it was necessary...

30
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,790
The power of Phantom.

31
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,510
Phantom. Inferno's ultimate assassin.

32
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,070
The title given to the best sniper in the organization.

33
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,290
My masterpiece...

34
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,540
Ein.

35
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,060
And Zwei.

36
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,140
He too.

37
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,580
But in the end I'm just being used by the organization.

38
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:46,740
Both Phantom and I have no other choice but to live like slaves.

39
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,580
We indeed have that in common.

40
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,400
But we're not slaves.

41
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,550
Even you have your freedom.

42
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,050
It's speed.

43
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,340
Speed?

44
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,800
Even if the course is predetermined,

45
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,300
as long as you wish and put in effort,

46
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,060
you can accelerate your speed.

47
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,920
You might even stand at the top of the organization.

48
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,070
You're free to decide how you'll go.

49
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,800
Say, Lizzie.

50
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,250
Would you comply with any order?

51
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,900
I won't work under someone I wouldn't follow.

52
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,590
That sounds like you.

53
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,520
Hey, Clau.

54
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,260
What?

55
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,260
I've been meaning to apologize for some time now.

56
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,310
Four years ago, I wholeheartedly joined your organization but wasn't of any use.

57
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:11,220
Your organization was crushed by Wisemel,

58
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,530
and even Romero was...

59
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,330
Back then, if I had been...

60
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,830
It's all in the past now.

61
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,480
The weak will be assimilated by the strong.

62
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,110
That's how nature works.

63
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,720
That's why I've joined Inferno.

64
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,430
Clau...

65
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:47,480
One day I just have to get back what I lost
and what was taken away from me...

66
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,630
I want you to do another job for me in Los Angeles soon.

67
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,020
You want to do an unexpected job,

68
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,910
to make the higher-ups owe you one?

69
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,270
Yes.

70
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,290
That's why we need to do this in a clandestine manner.

71
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,920
I'm not personally against such plotting.

72
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,530
He's no longer necessary to me.

73
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,690
I'll take Zwei...

74
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,140
Phantom...

75
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,310
It can't be...

76
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,040
Yes. This is your passport.

77
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,030
The real you... your past is written in it.

78
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,090
Try reading your name.

79
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,470
Azuma...

80
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,030
Reiji.

81
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,910
Right... I was on a trip.

82
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,560
And then...

83
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,290
Hello? This is the Azuma residence.

84
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,380
Hello?

85
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,430
Hello?

86
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,780
There's no way I could go back there.

87
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,290
Which organization are they from?!

88
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,010
Phantom?!

89
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,260
Damn you, Scythe!

90
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,080
You idiot!

91
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,510
Why are you shooting your allies?!

92
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,760
This might be Scythe's order but stop acting like a puppet!

93
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,410
You can't escape!

94
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,280
Think about this.

95
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,400
Ein!

96
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,200
I have to do it.

97
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:08,110
Ein, I'm the only one who can protect you.

98
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,290
I won't forsake you.

99
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,450
I definitely won't hand you over to the organization.

100
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,250
Let's escape together...

101
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,150
From this city...

102
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,130
From Inferno.

103
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,400
Why are you so concerned about me?

104
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,560
You won't benefit from this in any way.

105
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,070
I don't want to let you die.

106
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,410
I don't want to leave you to your death.

107
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,450
This isn't for anyone.

108
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,070
I'm doing this on my own will.

109
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,810
You need a new name.

110
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,730
A name?

111
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,630
Not Phantom nor a number.

112
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,270
A name for you to live as yourself.

113
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,390
Elen. Your name is Elen.

114
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,140
From now on I'll call you Elen.

115
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,140
Why Elen?

116
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,130
Do you need a reason?

117
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,600
I've decided that.

118
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:23,300
A name to live as yourself. Not as a puppet or an assassin.

119
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,540
Elen.

120
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,120
Elen... It sounds kind of strange.

121
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:36,620
Let's look for your lost past, Elen.

122
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,200
Together with me.

123
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,620
That isn't like you, Ein.

124
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,630
Overcome your pain with your will.

125
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,880
Master.

126
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,240
She went back to Scythe.

127
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,730
No way.

128
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,740
Idiot. You assisted the traitor.

129
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,770
You're a suspect now.

130
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,780
You cannot return to Japan anymore.

131
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,630
But you still have an ideal choice left.

132
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,760
A way to prove your innocence and get Ein back.

133
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,140
What is that?

134
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,160
You know how to use this, don't you?

135
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,160
I'll kill Scythe.

136
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,400
Scythe!

137
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,990
Reiji...

138
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,700
That's an interesting outcome.

139
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,760
How appropriate for the finale.

140
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,040
During the past three months,

141
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,320
we've successfully taken over one of the important organizations that control the east,

142
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,070
the Renato Family of Boston, as well as the Baldini Clan of Philadelphia.

143
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:03,540
We've also started negotiations with our rivals about them joining us.

144
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,570
Our policy won't change.

145
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,840
We'll give a backhand to those who play tough against us,

146
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,960
and death to those who dare to strike back.

147
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,150
Creation and destruction.

148
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,990
This country will change...

149
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,600
To our era... The era of Inferno.

150
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,730
Is it okay to leave everything to her?

151
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,990
She's doing an excellent job.

152
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:40,160
Her existence is vital to Inferno,
which needs a little rest from its expansion.

153
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,820
Besides...

154
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,250
...you have your subordinates called "Bloodies."

155
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,710
And I have you.

156
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:57,380
Because she doesn't have any backing,
she's unaffected by any interest conflicts.

157
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,390
She has Phantom.

158
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,160
Phantom is indeed very skilled.

159
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,080
But the organization won't bow down to Phantom alone.

160
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,910
Just as we saw with Scythe Master three months ago.

161
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,610
There's no mistake.

162
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,230
He's such a fool.

163
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,740
Now that he's lost Phantom...

164
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,400
He has no value.

165
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,620
Sorry for making you wait, Mr Giuseppe.

166
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:38,740
If Claudia should get arrogant, and repeat the same mistake,

167
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,610
we'll just dispose of her.

168
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,210
You can drive a bit longer.

169
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,370
Come back in about an hour.

170
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,370
Do you think this is too good to be true?

171
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,000
Ms McCunnen, I fail to see...

172
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,720
...what you would gain by offering such favorable terms to us.

173
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,260
I want the Godoh Group to owe me a favor.

174
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:30,060
Someone with a strong sense of duty like you would owe me a favor. That's all.

175
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,860
So you want someone to back you up?

176
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,230
Right.

177
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,360
I'll give you these 200 million dollars.

178
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,090
But I'll gain something even more valuable than that.

179
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,980
It certainly makes business sense.

180
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:50,580
We'll inform you later regarding the profit.

181
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,740
We'll win big.

182
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,720
It means we'll have a big debt to owe then.

183
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,330
This is the true beginning.

184
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,710
Right, Romero?

185
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,470
No way... Taking so many men alone...

186
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,750
Who is he?!

187
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:59,090
Zwei, I acknowledge your loyalty and contribution,

188
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,780
and bestow the title that you're worthy of.

189
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,770
I approve thy succession.

190
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:12,040
From now on, you'll stand at the top,
and live that name in the underground world.

191
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,120
Accompanied with fear.

192
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,670
Phantom.

193
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,260
From this moment, you are Inferno's Phantom.

194
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,740
I will obtain everything.

195
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,270
You're necessary for that.

196
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:40,820
Reiji, my Phantom.

197
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,340
Okay, Reiji.

198
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,540
From now on, the two of us are partners.
