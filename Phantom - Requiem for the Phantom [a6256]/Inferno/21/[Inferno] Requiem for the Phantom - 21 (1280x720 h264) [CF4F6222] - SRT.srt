1
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,590
Were you still alive,

2
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,930
Cal Devens?

3
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,810
Did something happen?

4
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,070
I saw a phantom.

5
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,360
I swore to protect her.

6
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,500
I promised to go back.

7
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,630
But I let her die alone...

8
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,000
That's what I thought the whole time.

9
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,670
You thought wrong, right?

10
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,340
The one who shot yesterday was her.

11
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,590
I see.

12
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:42,240
Cal joined Inferno as a sniper.

13
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,420
Master Huang,

14
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,970
I, Xu Jian Fa, feel greatly honored to be able to become your sworn brother

15
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,210
on such an important date such as your birthday.

16
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,180
Xu... Don't be so humble.

17
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:19,630
I should've rewarded you for your achievements in expanding us into West Japan.

18
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,530
I believe Kantou will also be ours soon.

19
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,510
I'll be counting on you.

20
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,430
My younger brother, let us toast for our journey ahead.

21
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:38,100
The Godoh Group's request is to finish off the head of the rival Chinese mafia group - Xu, right?

22
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,490
Is there something wrong?

23
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,980
Is there a need to finish off that Huang geezer?

24
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,300
You do realize that he's helping a group that's opposing Inferno.

25
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:53,790
If I remember correctly, he helped you out a lot when you were removed from Inferno.

26
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,290
He knows too much.

27
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,800
You don't care about morals?

28
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,820
You can care about that.

29
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,840
But I'm different. That's all.

30
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,490
This is Gregor. Your orders?

31
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,230
Yeah, I'm listening.

32
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,230
Gregor here. We're all in position.

33
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,910
We can go in anytime.

34
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,210
Just stay where you are for now.

35
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,240
What happened to Phantom?

36
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,770
I don't know.

37
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,020
She didn't like this mission from the beginning.

38
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,360
I'm leaving her out of it.

39
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,270
Is that okay?

40
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,560
She certainly might not be suitable for this mission.

41
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,000
She's only giving cover after all.

42
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,210
Gregor, just carry out the mission as originally planned.

43
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,690
First, Parker's group infiltrates from behind and takes out the bodyguards.

44
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,760
Roger that.

45
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:56,040
It'll take them three minutes to lure out Huang and Xu?

46
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,330
Are you dissatisfied?

47
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,030
No, not at all.

48
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,110
But if she did it, it would only take ten seconds.

49
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,730
Ten seconds?

50
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,700
Dammit!

51
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,860
You fucking bastard!

52
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,620
What's going on?!

53
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,580
That's...

54
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,430
Watch out!

55
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,220
Goddammit!

56
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,480
What the fuck is this?!

57
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,900
I think this is the most effective and rational way of doing it.

58
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,230
This is Japan!

59
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,700
Putting on a big show like this will...

60
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:38,910
The value of a life is the same whether it's in Japan or America.

61
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,100
This way!

62
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,880
Master Huang.

63
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,850
Who's responsible for this crazy attack?

64
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,050
I think I know.

65
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,620
Are you from Scythe?!

66
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,720
I was the one who saved that man!

67
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,710
Is this how he's going to repay the favor?!

68
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,430
Favor? What does that mean again?

69
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,130
Master Huang!

70
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,630
You've got some guts.

71
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,020
Still not going to admit your defeat?

72
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,330
I like you.

73
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,000
Let's play a game.

74
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,160
Do you like to play games?

75
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,050
We'll shoot when the song ends.

76
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,670
You're taking me lightly...

77
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,350
It doesn't matter which organization you're from.

78
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,680
Don't think you'll get off lightly for doing something like this!

79
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,270
I see...

80
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,960
You're still clueless.

81
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,350
Phantom.

82
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,700
Since you live in the underworld,
you've probably heard of that name, right?

83
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,100
Correct.

84
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,820
That's...

85
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,410
Me.

86
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,390
If you defeat me, the whole world will bow down to you.

87
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:35,240
Pick your occupation wisely in your next life.

88
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,380
Adios, chink.

89
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,270
I was the one who created this mess.

90
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,490
I taught her how to kill.

91
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,860
I showed her the way to the underworld.

92
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,840
These hands of mine screwed her life up.

93
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,290
The escape preparations will soon be complete.

94
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,450
Until then...

95
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,410
Yeah.

96
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,800
I got it.

97
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,520
Where did you go yesterday?

98
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,940
To see some friends.

99
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,810
Did you come in contact with him?

100
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,000
Zwei, that is.

101
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,160
That's none of your business.

102
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,280
I'll settle things with them my way.

103
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,210
I see.

104
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,440
It's your turn next, Reiji.

105
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,110
Umm...

106
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,330
Good morning.

107
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,450
You went home pretty early yesterday.

108
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,320
Huh?

109
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,870
Well, you see...

110
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,820
You had already left when I went to find Sanae after school.

111
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,560
I had stuff to do.

112
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,600
It's not like I'm trying to pry into your life.

113
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,450
I wasn't thinking that at all.

114
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:57,740
Okay...

115
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,140
It's snowing.

116
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,250
You're right...

117
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,870
The weather forecast was wrong.

118
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,600
It's beautiful, isn't it?

119
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,490
Yeah.

120
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,820
You really spiced things up, Miss Garland.

121
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,980
Even the police is on it.

122
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:50,700
I suggest whoever was involved in the shooting yesterday to leave this country immediately.

123
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,200
Don't worry about that.

124
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,620
They left... Most of them.

125
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,760
That's great.

126
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:06,590
Anyway, I thank you for erasing Xu without leaving any evidence trail back to the Godoh Group.

127
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:15,460
However, I would appreciate it if you would tell us your plans before the next time you do something in Japan.

128
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,910
Please excuse me.

129
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,790
It's not like it was some insanely hard mission.

130
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:36,330
Had we stuck to the plan, no one would have had to die.

131
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,920
It was my mistake.

132
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,710
When she... When Phantom didn't appear,

133
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,840
I should've known something like this was going to happen.

134
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,450
Don't blame yourself.

135
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,180
It's true that Drei has problems.

136
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,820
However, it can be understood.

137
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,690
Drei is too impatient.

138
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,400
The current Drei has not fully taken over the name of Phantom.

139
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,950
Because she hasn't fought it out with the previous Phantom.

140
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,470
If Drei truly takes over the name of Phantom,

141
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:14,700
she will become steady and flexible.

142
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:22,730
In other words, if she defeats Zwei with her own hands...

143
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:35,060
Reiji, no boxed lunch today, right?

144
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,280
Yeah... But Motegi, how did you know?

145
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,730
Then let's go to the cafeteria.

146
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,670
That's fine with me, but what about yours?

147
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,440
I ate it after second period.

148
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,140
Since you're the cool kid for today, Motegi,

149
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,080
I'll allow you to sit there.

150
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,390
Yes, thank you.

151
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,540
Do you still remember me?

152
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:05,990
Of course.

153
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,050
You're the unpopular Motegi-kun.

154
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,880
That's what my brother said.

155
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,760
How did you introduce me?

156
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,010
You used me too, didn't you?

157
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:18,770
I'm begging you! Just share a little of your happiness with me!

158
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,940
You're so forcible.

159
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,320
Oh come on, Brother.

160
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,310
These things aren't bad once in a while.

161
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,110
I know, right?

162
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,020
I feel honored to have the same train of thought as you, Elen-chan!

163
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,620
I guess we're made for each other, right?

164
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,650
Are you saying that Cal won't dare to try anything in a group of people?

165
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,620
I guess so.

166
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,130
Look after my seat. I'm gonna go buy food.

167
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,390
Okay.

168
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,580
Get me a B set.

169
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,970
Buy it yourself.

170
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:57,220
Oh? So the reason Reiji had to leave early was because of you?

171
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,860
I had to discuss some family matters with my brother.

172
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,620
I'm sorry... Even though I knew he was on a date with Mio.

173
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,320
It wasn't a date.

174
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,950
What?

175
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,590
If that's the case, just be straight with it.

176
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,990
Well, I thought it would sound kind of lame...

177
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,670
You dense bastard!

178
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,270
A person like that should be punished.

179
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,400
Why are you eating it?

180
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,760
Because you're hogging the happiness all to yourself!

181
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,660
What do you mean?

182
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,280
Are you seriously dense or what?!

183
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,020
There are a lot of people in this world who aren't as lucky as you!

184
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,510
Yeah!

185
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,470
For example, Motegi.

186
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,500
What?!

187
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,150
Someone asked me to give this to you.

188
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,900
Thank you.

189
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,160
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

190
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,830
You're kidding...

191
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,750
What's wrong?

192
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,980
Some underclassman's request.

193
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,560
A tiny bit of happiness just left...

194
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,510
Didn't you only want a little?

195
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,220
Now then...

196
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,400
Hey, where do you think you're going?

197
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,630
I have to make sure none of the guys bother her.

198
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:24,970
Elen's pretty popular. You'll get tired soon if you go every single time.

199
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,190
You siscon!

200
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:27,730
But...

201
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:32,110
Just go. She's your only sister after all.

202
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,660
I'm sorry. I'll make up for it next time.

203
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,990
What about me?!

204
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,300
Keep dreaming.

205
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,990
Elen...

206
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,120
Are you looking for someone?

207
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,760
Do you want to kill me?

208
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,610
That's right, you're capable of killing me.

209
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,640
Not by being ordered, not by being driven into a corner,

210
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,520
but by your own will.

211
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,820
And that's why you're special, Zwei.

212
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,380
Ein, even though brainwashed,

213
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,450
cannot be compared with you who has a genuine killing intent.

214
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,000
From a certain point of view, you can be branded as a failure.

215
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:15,660
But you gave me a new line of research.

216
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:23,180
So I began exploring the theme of "hatred".

217
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:29,020
You saw it, right? My proud third creation, Drei.

218
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,350
What did you do to Cal?

219
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,970
If you're speaking from a concluding point of view, I didn't do anything.

220
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,800
No brainwashing. No hinting.

221
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,170
No control of her memories or emotions.

222
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:45,620
I just completely uncovered...

223
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,700
the hatred within her.

224
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:57,480
I thank you for giving me such a genius.

225
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,170
Scythe, you're the only one I...

226
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,760
Can't forgive? Hate?

227
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,430
But you can't kill me here.

228
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,640
There's too much risk.

229
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,070
Such self-control.

230
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:21,360
Not only do you have a genuine killing intent, but also a calm sense of judgment.

231
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,820
A perfect balance.

232
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:28,770
But Drei is awful at that. She can't control herself.

233
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,520
But...

234
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,920
At least she has a way to cover for it.

235
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,420
Don't tell me...

236
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,010
You'd better hurry if you want to help her.

237
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,620
Hurry up and show yourself.

238
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,650
No one will interfere with us here.

239
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,090
Nice to meet you, Ein.

240
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,920
Or should I call you the Old Phantom?

241
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,630
We are...

242
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,120
...ghosts that cannot exist anywhere.

243
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,610
We are phantoms with no identity.

244
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,090
The only reason I'm still alive...

245
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:29,420
...is to find and kill that man.

246
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,690
That's all.
