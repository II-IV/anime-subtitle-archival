1
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,240
I must kill or be killed!

2
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,270
Are you awake yet?

3
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,990
There's no need to be scared.

4
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,150
I won't attack you anymore.

5
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,990
You're...

6
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,260
I have no name.

7
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,940
But if you must, call me Ein.

8
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,210
That's what they always call me.

9
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,090
Ein...

10
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,590
Why did you attack me?

11
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,180
To have you prove your skills.

12
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,180
My skills?

13
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,180
You were born with certain instincts.

14
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,450
An instinct for killing,

15
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,660
and an instinct for surviving.

16
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,690
Both are instincts that define an assassin.

17
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,690
No way!

18
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,460
I don't understand!

19
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,030
Besides, what proof do you have?

20
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,030
You tried to kill me, didn't you?

21
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,870
In that situation,

22
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:14,060
a normal person would have panicked and gotten killed as a result.

23
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,670
But you were different.

24
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:22,160
You chose to act before assessing the situation, and managed to survive.

25
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,100
Zwei.

26
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,600
"Zwei"?

27
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,560
That's your name.

28
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,100
No, it's not. Quit calling me by weird names!

29
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,480
I have a real name, and it's-

30
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,790
My...

31
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,320
...name is...

32
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,850
You don't have one anymore.

33
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,920
It's useless to even try to remember it.

34
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,170
What do you mean?

35
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,000
Your memories have been erased.

36
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,720
By Inferno.

37
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,890
Marvelous.

38
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,810
The victim was a well-known crime lord.

39
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,640
Your Phantom is superb, Scythe Master.

40
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,340
It is presumed that he was dragged into a gang fight.

41
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,100
I'm honored, Mr McGuire.

42
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,940
I can't believe a kid was able to pull this off.

43
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,530
Exactly.

44
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,780
Precisely the reason why I've given her the title of "Phantom".

45
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,870
You've made quite an accomplishment.

46
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,480
You've created a ghost that is truly out of this world.

47
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,910
Well, it's all thanks to Ms McCunnen's support.

48
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,520
Looks like you've got some capable people working for you, Claudia.

49
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:45,130
But I heard you took your time in eliminating that journalist.

50
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,140
I beg to differ.

51
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:53,900
Also, you allowed tourists to witness the murder.

52
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,880
I have no idea where you heard that from,

53
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,480
but all witnesses have been taken care of.

54
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,140
Their bodies have been disposed of, as well.

55
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,670
Oh?

56
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,900
Excellent.

57
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,150
Did Phantom take care of that, too?

58
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,570
Yes.

59
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,160
You were supposed to be killed.

60
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,180
So that all evidence relating to the incident would be erased.

61
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,360
But Master noticed your talents,

62
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,990
and decided it'd be a waste to let you die.

63
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,290
Master?

64
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,010
Scythe Master.

65
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,010
My master.

66
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,000
Master then erased your memories,

67
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,380
and prepared a new life for you.

68
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,360
A life as a member of Inferno.

69
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,320
A life as an assassin.

70
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,510
An assassin?

71
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:51,830
Me?

72
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,330
You will become Zwei, my alter ego.

73
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,960
Don't be ridiculous!

74
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,590
Why in the world would I-

75
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,510
I couldn't possibly kill a-

76
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,850
Sure, you can refuse.

77
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,850
But when you do...

78
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:12,400
...you will die as originally planned.

79
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,180
Right now, right here.

80
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,810
You will change if you want to live.

81
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,900
Only by killing, will you be allowed to exist.

82
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,240
I...

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,620
...don't want to die.

84
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,910
This is a dream.

85
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,330
All of this is just a nightmare.

86
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,390
If that'll make you feel better, then that's fine.

87
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,630
Just pretend that it's all a dream.

88
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,710
But I'll tell you this now. It'll be a long one.

89
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,660
Change into that.

90
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,830
Starting today, you'll be with me day and night.

91
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,130
You will follow every one of my orders.

92
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,200
Understood?

93
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,340
Let's get started.

94
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,360
Zwei's progress is coming along nicely.

95
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,700
He's faithfully participating in the training without complaint.

96
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,930
He's quite obedient.

97
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,540
Even thinking is a chore in the midst of that rigorous training.

98
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,680
Yes.

99
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,550
That's how you break them.

100
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,700
Let me show you something that won't betray your expectations, Ms McCunnen.

101
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,200
You think I was expecting something?

102
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,930
What is mine is yours.

103
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,350
Everything is for the sake of Inferno, after all.

104
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,660
This is how you hold it.

105
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,920
Don't put your finger over the trigger.

106
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:22,210
Focus all of your power to your fingers instead of your shoulders.

107
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:25,250
This is the rear sight, and this is the front sight.

108
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,980
Focus your aim through the rear sight into the front sight.

109
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,400
When aiming, stretch out your right arm.

110
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,490
Stabilize the gun by pulling back with your left.

111
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,490
Even then, most of your power should be within your hands and not your arms.

112
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,740
Don't panic when pulling the trigger.

113
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,500
Pull it as if you're squeezing gently.

114
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,210
Shoot.

115
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,240
Fire the remaining five shots in succession.

116
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,340
From this distance, you should be able to hit the mark all six times.

117
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,520
Once you have that down, we'll work on your speed.

118
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,770
Your target is to fire six shots in four seconds.

119
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,750
First, concentrate on hitting the target.

120
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,140
That's still too slow.

121
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,640
Looks like you're able to shoot accurately now,

122
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,380
but at this rate, you'll die before you can shoot your target.

123
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,250
Repeat.

124
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,340
Repeat.

125
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,610
I will continue to fulfill all tasks given to me.

126
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,530
This way, I don't have to think.

127
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,990
This way, I can be at peace.

128
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,240
I'll even forget all the questions I have...

129
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:04,940
And my daily life will disappear.

130
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,360
I'm heading out.

131
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,840
Carry out the usual training menu.

132
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,560
You're going out?

133
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,920
I've got a job to do.

134
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,320
Let's go, Phantom.

135
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,210
Yes, Master.

136
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,990
Master?

137
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,330
He's Scythe Master?

138
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:43,120
We haven't had a sniping mission in a while, but it shouldn't be a problem for you.

139
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,960
You will be 700 yards away from the target.

140
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,650
We've prepared a Remington .308 for you to use.

141
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,890
The current weather at the location is cloudy with slight winds.

142
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,240
It'll most likely stay that way until tomorrow morning.

143
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,020
The details are inside that envelope.

144
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,060
Any questions?

145
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,050
No.

146
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,190
Very well.

147
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,650
So, how's Zwei coming along?

148
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,820
He's finished the basic regimen.

149
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,370
Tomorrow he'll start with a different training menu.

150
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,370
I guess I should start getting his practical test ready then, hm?

151
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,440
Don't mind me.

152
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,380
As you were.

153
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,200
I guess we've never met before.

154
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,820
I'm Claudia McCunnen.

155
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,390
Don't you have anything else you want to know about me other than my name?

156
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,070
No.

157
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,070
But I'm sure you're interested in learning about Inferno, since they picked you up.

158
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,040
I'll take your silence as a "yes".

159
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,100
Inferno...

160
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:06,250
...is a group trying to create a new sovereign order in a world without legal order, I guess.

161
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,280
If gangs and mafias could be compared to nations,

162
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,910
then Inferno would be the United Nations.

163
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:18,190
Inferno's goal is to unite the underworld.

164
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:23,580
A fantasy like that wouldn't have even been told as a joke a little while ago.

165
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,770
But now it's being turned into reality by...

166
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,530
...Phantom.

167
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,760
That's right, your coach.

168
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,070
Phantom's power is absolute.

169
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,220
Her existence, as someone who can effectively eliminate targets,

170
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,800
provides the highest level of confidence to Inferno,

171
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,490
while instilling the greatest fear in its enemies.

172
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:57,200
Without a doubt, she is the best assassin alive.

173
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,310
But...

174
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,220
In the end, she's only a puppet of the organization.

175
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:11,400
Both Phantom and I have no choice but to live as slaves.

176
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:20,610
Like you say, we may be forcing this lifestyle upon you.

177
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,470
But you're not a slave.

178
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,540
Even you possess a freedom.

179
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,720
Speed.

180
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:35,830
Speed?

181
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:42,240
Even in a set course, as long as you desire and work for it,

182
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,980
you can accelerate towards any goal.

183
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,860
You may even be able to stand at the top of this organization.

184
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,250
How you run through it is up to you.

185
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,350
Don't ever think of yourself as a slave again.

186
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:14,370
As long as you have that thought in mind,
you're granting victory to those who belittle you.

187
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,860
I wanted to chat for a little longer,

188
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,660
but there's work I need to tend to.

189
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:50,060
Goodbye, Zwei.

190
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,450
You know, cars are driven by people.

191
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,550
Not by puppets.

192
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:19,010
Even in a set course, as long as you desire and work for it,

193
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,030
you can accelerate towards any goal.

194
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,520
Desire...

195
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,260
Work...

196
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,830
I'd forgotten about those words for a while now.

197
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:12,830
Ein.

198
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,750
What is it?

199
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:20,550
Did you... kill someone in today's mission?

200
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:21,850
Yes.

201
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,930
Why did you... become an assassin?

202
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,630
I don't know.

203
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,710
I've never been told about my past.

204
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,940
That means...

205
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,750
Yes.

206
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,060
I'm just like you.

207
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,610
They erased my memories and made me an assassin.

208
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,200
But so what?

209
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,850
Surviving the moment...

210
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,420
That's all that matters to us assassins.

211
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:02,550
There's nothing for us in the past or future.

212
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,610
But this woman called Claudia said...

213
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:10,980
Claudia?

214
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,460
She came here this afternoon.

215
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:19,070
She said we weren't slaves, and that we have freedom.

216
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,530
If that's what you want to believe, then so be it.

217
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,550
But soon, like me, you won't be able to feel anything.

218
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,070
Because it's the only way of coping with this way of life.

219
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,320
You'll be like that someday.

220
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,060
You'll understand when you actually kill someone.

221
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:17,370
When you're just aiming at bricks, it's easy to pull the trigger.

222
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,630
But...

223
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,660
But...

224
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:26,740
Fire.

225
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,510
Fire, Zwei.

226
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,470
Zwei...

227
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,800
This is just the continuation of a dream.

228
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:33,140
A dream that will not end until you die.
