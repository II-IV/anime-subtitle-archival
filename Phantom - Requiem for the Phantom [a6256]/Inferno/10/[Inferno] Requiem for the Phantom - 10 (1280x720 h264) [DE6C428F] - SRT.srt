1
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,470
Elen.

2
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,460
What is it?

3
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,800
Nothing...

4
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,940
I wanted to see how you would react when I called you by that name.

5
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,620
You found him, didn't you?

6
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,880
Where is Scythe?

7
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,970
Yes. Thanks for picking me up, Colonel Roshenenko.

8
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,150
Not at all.

9
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,980
I'm actually honored that you've remembered me, Dr. Giuseppe.

10
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,230
When you call me by my name,
it makes me remember my days in Moscow.

11
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,790
Either way, I'm amazed that a sharp and able person like you has been cornered and is now on the run...

12
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,700
Was the fieldwork a tad different from the work in the laboratory?

13
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,700
"There's a tide in the affairs of men."

14
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,420
What?

15
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,320
It's from Shakespeare.

16
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,760
Their tide is also mine.

17
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,720
What I had to make here...

18
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,220
...has already been made.

19
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,470
There's been some suspicious movements by a small weapons dealer named Roshenenko.

20
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,130
It seems like he's Scythe's old friend,

21
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,230
and he's been around here in the Bay Area.

22
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,560
Scythe was seen heading there, too.

23
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,950
In other words, that snaky bastard is somewhere in San Francisco trying to escape.

24
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,420
Clau?

25
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,210
You...

26
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,930
Are you insane, Clau?!

27
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:08,100
Phantom pointed her gun at us and he helped her escape!

28
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,980
And you still expect me to take him with us?

29
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,980
Yes, exactly.

30
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,740
Sheesh! You're such a cunning woman.

31
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,450
The same goes for you.

32
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,230
I'll be the commander at the scene.

33
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:36,060
Scythe is headed to the Woodland pier in East Bay.

34
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,370
It seems that several of Roshenenko's men have been spotted there.

35
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,250
Understood.

36
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,000
Come with me.

37
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,030
Kill him without fail.

38
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,140
If you do...

39
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,840
I also regret that we couldn't secure Zwei.

40
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,500
But it couldn't be helped considering the situation we're in right now.

41
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,020
I'll leave Zwei to that vixen.

42
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,810
Master...

43
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,950
Why did you...

44
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,100
When did you start asking questions?

45
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,580
I'm deeply sorry.

46
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,590
What's the matter, comrade Roshenenko?

47
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,350
Oh...

48
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,560
They found it.

49
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,110
Yes, don't worry.

50
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,330
I'll make my staff show them some hospitality.

51
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,190
You're going to help me?

52
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,150
I really appreciate it.

53
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,340
Bye.

54
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,910
So, he wants me to owe him a favor by sending a few of his men, huh?

55
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,090
Ein.

56
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:53,770
Can you still live up to my expectations?

57
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,640
Use this.

58
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,560
This is an appropriate ornament for tonight's stage.

59
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,030
There are two more magazines.

60
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,570
As you know, you'll need good command of the gun.

61
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,780
Try to avoid rapid fire as much as possible.

62
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,060
Yes.

63
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,560
Finish it wisely.

64
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,370
This will be your last job.

65
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,290
Yes.

66
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,930
Ms Garland will be at the pier in a moment.

67
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,680
I'm sure she'll succeed.

68
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,360
I heard you sent Zwei as well.

69
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,680
Yes.

70
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,390
He betrayed Inferno once.

71
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,640
If the result deters Inferno's path in any way,

72
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,530
I will take any kind of punishment.

73
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,960
You trust him that much?

74
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,580
What I trust is that someone who has been killing because of his missions...

75
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,160
...will have the urge to murder someone with his own will.

76
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:16,200
To be honest, I have my doubts...

77
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,010
Is it really wise to let you, who's holding a gun, live or not?

78
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,690
I agree.

79
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,740
I have 15 bullets in the magazine and one ready to fire.

80
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,520
If you do the math, I'd still have bullets left after killing everyone here.

81
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,280
What?

82
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,710
What are you doing?

83
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:47,270
I can't take you all down with only one bullet.

84
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,880
But it will be enough to kill Scythe.

85
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,380
These are some big words, boy.

86
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,890
It's much better than being shot in the back by you.

87
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,410
Above!

88
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,760
That snaky bastard!

89
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,810
Hey! Wait!

90
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,210
Scythe... where are you?!

91
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,750
I won't let you go, you traitor!

92
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,370
I don't know if you're number 1 or 2, but...

93
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,750
...I won't let you run off after using us like pawns.

94
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,940
Because of you my brother died!

95
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:14,860
Even if the higher-ups forgive you, I'll never...

96
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,120
...forgive you.

97
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,960
Elen.

98
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,510
Let's go back.

99
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,400
It's not too late.

100
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,830
Please...

101
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:04,910
Come back with me...

102
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,490
Scythe!

103
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,300
Ein.

104
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,380
I see.

105
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,020
Well done, Zwei.

106
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,270
I felt that you would surpass Ein one day...

107
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,320
I see why that vixen wants you so badly.

108
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,510
Not only did you attain great success in a short time,

109
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,990
but you also used Ein as a stepping stone.

110
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,490
Stepping stone?

111
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:50,430
I'm sure you're well aware of this.

112
00:12:59,250 --> 00:12:59,750
Stop.

113
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,260
Please, don't.

114
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,290
Don't worry.

115
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,270
If I kill him, Inferno won't come after you.

116
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,440
So, please...

117
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:20,980
Elen.

118
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,510
Ein, kill Zwei.

119
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,200
When you have done that, you'll be the Ein I desire.

120
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,770
We're going, Ein.

121
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,600
You moron!

122
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,500
Is this how it ends after all those big words?

123
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,110
How did you guys do?

124
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,670
We killed most of them.

125
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,740
We have quite a few casualties, too.

126
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,110
But as you can see I'm safe and sound.

127
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,620
Get up.

128
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,080
You're going to kill Scythe, right?

129
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,840
I was told that there would be a boat waiting for us at the fifth pier.

130
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,680
It's on the southeastern end.

131
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,340
Understood.

132
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,850
Scythe!

133
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,730
You damn snake! Come out and shoot!

134
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,620
Hold her back.

135
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,220
I'll go ahead.

136
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,290
Understood.

137
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,860
He's Roshenenko's...

138
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,810
Master!

139
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,180
Scythe!

140
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,820
Reiji...

141
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,300
That's an interesting outcome.

142
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,360
How appropriate for the finale.

143
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,030
Elen.

144
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,040
What is it?

145
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,460
Nothing...

146
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,600
I wanted to see how you would react when I called you by that name.

147
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:02,380
Am I supposed to laugh at a time like this?

148
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,610
I'm sorry.

149
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,310
I'll make you laugh one day.

150
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,460
I'm sure you can go back...

151
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,590
Laughing when you're happy, crying when you're sad...

152
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,820
Back to being a normal girl.

153
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,420
Normal...

154
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:28,510
So please, stay alive until then, Elen.

155
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,870
I'll definitely protect you.

156
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:42,760
Elen...

157
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:50,560
Our promise...

158
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,330
Your smile...

159
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,130
I've lost everything.

160
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,080
There's only...

161
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,760
...the title of a killer left to me.

162
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,260
Phantom.
