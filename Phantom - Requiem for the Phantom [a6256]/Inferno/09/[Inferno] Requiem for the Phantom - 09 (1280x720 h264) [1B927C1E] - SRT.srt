1
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,400
Are you awake?

2
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,310
Let me out.

3
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,810
And then?

4
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,020
I'll meet master.

5
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,950
He betrayed the organization and escaped.

6
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,030
He abandoned you.

7
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,630
The mission is still ongoing.

8
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,040
I'll meet up with master.

9
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,520
If that's impossible, I'll help him escape.

10
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,000
If I create a commotion, I can cut off the pursuers of the organization.

11
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,220
Stop.

12
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,560
I can't.

13
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,680
If you want to continue your mission, stay with me.

14
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,930
Scythe is on run, but he's being protected by Phantom even now.

15
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,510
The fear of Phantom is always with him.

16
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,240
That's why the organization can't act carelessly.

17
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,290
If you got caught now, he'd be at a disadvantage, too.

18
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,460
You've changed, Zwei.

19
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,210
Have I?

20
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,010
Yes. It's like you're different than you were yesterday.

21
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,430
Yes... You're no longer Zwei.

22
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,800
You're Azuma Reiji.

23
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,930
You were listening?

24
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,660
You have a place to return to.

25
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,840
You still have your real self.

26
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:37,190
But I... I have nothing.

27
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,220
I'm Ein.

28
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,810
All I have is a number.

29
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,200
The only place I can return to is to my master.

30
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,860
That's not true!

31
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,330
I don't have anything else...

32
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,360
Except the name "Ein" he gave me.

33
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,090
Ein.

34
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,340
That's me.

35
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,310
I'm no one... A phantom...

36
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,220
You're wrong.

37
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,290
Thanks.

38
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,070
Thanks for your business.

39
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,900
You should eat something.

40
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,330
Didn't you think that I'd be gone?

41
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,340
You're reckless, but not stupid.

42
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,060
The robbed vehicle was found.

43
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,860
It was empty, though.

44
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,860
So they completely escaped from our hands.

45
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,810
Scythe is your dog.

46
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,590
You ought to take care of this.

47
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,580
Understood.

48
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,870
You know this song?

49
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,400
Sorry. Is it too loud?

50
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,060
What is it called?

51
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,240
Uh... I forgot.

52
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,950
I don't remember the title, but I used to hear it quite often in the city.

53
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:23,410
Does everyone in Japan listen to such songs?

54
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,570
People have different tastes in music.

55
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,780
Los Angeles is the same as Japan.

56
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,280
Tell me more about Japan.

57
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,030
You remembered, didn't you?

58
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,790
The time you spent as Azuma Reiji.

59
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,750
Yeah.

60
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,060
It's me.

61
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,160
We got the goods as planned.

62
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,740
Have a safe flight.

63
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,730
What are you saying?

64
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,490
From the escape route to the logistics...

65
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,740
Everything is done by you.

66
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,090
I'll call you again once things calm down.

67
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,600
May our good relationship continue.

68
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,830
We can't trust that woman.

69
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,910
If we let our guard down, she'll even betray the Godoh clan.

70
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,310
Who cares.

71
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,700
We're using her, too.

72
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,520
Right?

73
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,890
It's too risky.

74
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,900
Don't freak out now, Shiga.

75
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,360
Show some guts.

76
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,670
I'm going to rise up high.

77
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,580
Azuma Reiji...

78
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,490
You should go back.

79
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,470
Go back?

80
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,200
Yes.

81
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,090
Where are you telling me to go back to?

82
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,240
You know what I've been doing for the last six months.

83
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,740
I can't go back at this point.

84
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,480
But you have a past.

85
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,320
You do exist in this world as Azuma Reiji.

86
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,070
The same goes for you, too.

87
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,400
You are right here...

88
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,100
You have something I don't.

89
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,620
You can prove your identity.

90
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,120
Is it that important to have a passport?

91
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,290
Yes, that's proof that you are indeed you.

92
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,130
Something I don't have.

93
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,470
What are you doing, Reiji?!

94
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,360
Do you realize what you have just done?

95
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,150
That's your-

96
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,360
Just a scrap of paper.

97
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,900
The thing that makes me myself are my memories of the past.

98
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,000
And you have that too.

99
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,630
Didn't you tell me about your dream before?

100
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,840
Your memories about those colors.

101
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,870
The strongly blowing wind and the brightness.

102
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,660
Aren't they memories of your hometown?

103
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,040
I just vaguely remember that.

104
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,350
There's no proof that it's my hometown.

105
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,740
But it's your memory.

106
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,510
You have a past.

107
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,520
You have a real name. Not a number like "Ein."

108
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,000
Why are you so concerned about me?

109
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,790
You won't benefit from this in any way.

110
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,670
I don't want to let you die.

111
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,170
I don't want to leave you to your death.

112
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,160
This isn't for anyone.

113
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,740
I'm doing this on my own will.

114
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:09,500
Sticking to this is the proof that I'm myself.

115
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:15,700
I don't need a paper or a stamp to prove that.

116
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,480
Your drivers license please.

117
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,910
Where are you from?

118
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,910
I'm coming from Los Angeles.

119
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,370
I'm visiting my friend.

120
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,820
Wallace Yang, 20.

121
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,610
You look younger.

122
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,930
People often tell me that.

123
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,470
Who's she?

124
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,160
She's my sister.

125
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,010
She looks kind of pale.

126
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,180
Well, yeah. We've been driving for quite some time now.

127
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,220
She's carsick.

128
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,420
Okay, you can go.

129
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,930
You've gotten better.

130
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,220
You mean my acting?

131
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,930
What are you saying? You taught me all that.

132
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,200
What are you planning to do now?

133
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,200
We'll move around and make you rest a little.

134
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,430
When your wound has healed, we'll go somewhere far away.

135
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,950
Somewhere far away?

136
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:39,920
Where exactly?

137
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,180
As far as we can.

138
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,680
That's absurd...

139
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,390
I told you. I decided that on my own.

140
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,150
I'll buy us something to eat.

141
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,360
Ein. Ein!

142
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:13,270
I haven't felt fear until yesterday...

143
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,770
My finger... doesn't move.

144
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,920
Reiji, shoot me.

145
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,150
Bring me to peace.

146
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,880
You're so selfish!

147
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,910
What happened?

148
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:35,180
Weren't you much stronger than me?

149
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,630
That's not true.

150
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,210
I...

151
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,380
Did it for master.

152
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,880
Just for him...

153
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,260
Even if I made the organization my enemy,

154
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,900
as long as I had master's orders...

155
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,350
Yet...

156
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,340
Why am I living now?

157
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,100
Being hunted by the organization... I'm just on the run.

158
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,360
I can't even pull the trigger.

159
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,330
If I had died there yesterday,

160
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,370
I could have at least died as Ein.

161
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,020
No way...

162
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,940
Were we fighting all the time to die?

163
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,770
You're wrong.

164
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:24,170
We've been fighting to survive.

165
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,130
I don't want you to die because of something this silly.

166
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,720
I want you to live.

167
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,420
That's all I want.

168
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,620
I'm being hunted by Inferno.

169
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,000
If the pursuers come here,

170
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,580
whom would you point your gun at?
Me or the organization?

171
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,510
I've already decided. I'll shoot at the organization.

172
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,800
I'll pull the trigger with my own will.

173
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,880
Why?

174
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,630
Why are you going this far to live?

175
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,500
Do you expect me to lead that life, too?

176
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,070
You don't want that?

177
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,690
I'm nobody now.

178
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,610
I don't have anything.

179
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,050
Not a mission, nor a reason to live.

180
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,360
Ein...

181
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,910
I'll stop calling you Ein.

182
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,070
That's just a number.

183
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,120
It isn't a name.

184
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,860
You need a new name.

185
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,940
A name?

186
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,880
Not Phantom nor a number.

187
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,470
A name for you to live as yourself.

188
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,710
Elen. Your name is Elen.

189
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,390
From now on I'll call you Elen.

190
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,400
Why Elen?

191
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,230
Do you need a reason?

192
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,860
I've decided that.

193
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:14,480
A name to live as yourself. Not as a puppet or an assassin.

194
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,790
Elen.

195
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,370
Elen... It sounds kind of strange.

196
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,910
Really?

197
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,880
Let's look for your lost past, Elen.

198
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:54,340
If you find your real name,
you can find enough reasons to live.

199
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,930
You'll think about living even if you have to hurt someone.

200
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,120
It might be hard for you at this point.

201
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,420
But please move on with me.

202
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:21,430
What if your favorite puppy sides with Scythe?

203
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,610
Kill him.

204
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,440
I'll get a new car and some cash.

205
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,630
I'll be back in an hour.

206
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,460
How's your wound?

207
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,600
It's fine as long as I don't move too much.

208
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,520
Be careful, Elen.

209
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,390
I will, Reiji.

210
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,630
Elen.

211
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,200
The name Reiji gave me.

212
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,100
With this name, I will...

213
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,820
That isn't like you, Ein.

214
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,820
Overcome your pain with your will.

215
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,530
Master.

216
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,550
This is the end, Zwei.

217
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,980
Was your childish honeymoon fun?

218
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,410
Lizzie.

219
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,640
Seems like you were dancing in Scythe's palm, huh?

220
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,760
I have nothing to do with him.

221
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,940
I wonder about that.

222
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,100
I'll listen to your story.

223
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,560
I just got a report...

224
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:38,030
...that my subordinate, who was following Phantom, was killed.

225
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,990
She went back to Scythe.

226
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,370
No way.

227
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,940
Elen!

228
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,870
How about you start talking already?!

229
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,100
Where did Scythe go?

230
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,380
I don't know. We...

231
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,740
Seems like he really doesn't know anything.

232
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,160
Leave the rest to me.

233
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,850
You may go now.

234
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,570
You are indeed stubborn.

235
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,370
The mic is off.

236
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,530
You can talk now.

237
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,960
Rescuing Ein and running away together...

238
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,540
Is that what you decided?

239
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:43,100
Idiot. You assisted the traitor.

240
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,120
You're a suspect now.

241
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,160
You cannot return to Japan anymore.

242
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:55,940
But you still have an ideal choice left.

243
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:02,110
A way to prove your innocence and get Ein back.

244
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,450
What is that?

245
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:31,470
You know how to use this, don't you?

246
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,110
I'll kill Scythe.

247
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,830
Elen, one day I'll make you smile.

248
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,740
I'll get your usual smile back.
