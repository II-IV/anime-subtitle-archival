1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,580
Who's our next target?

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,140
Frank Claude.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,400
We've finally tracked him down.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,820
Are you planning on using those strange folks again?

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,470
I thought we had already agreed to dispatch them.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,450
They're going to make it flashy, aren't they?

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,450
It's a necessary measure to raise awareness of our existence.

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:27,580
Their powers are hellfire that will burn down Hell itself,

9
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,600
and we will build our world there.

10
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,770
Are you hurt?

11
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,270
It's just a scratch.

12
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:40,850
I will...

13
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,080
...kill.

14
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,290
In order to survive...

15
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,260
...I will kill.

16
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,270
I'm going to be killed.

17
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,510
I'm going to be killed unless I escape.

18
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,400
I can't run from those black eyes.

19
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,620
What should I do?

20
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,950
If I can't escape, I'll have to kill.

21
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,730
If I don't kill, I'll be killed.

22
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,360
Where am I?

23
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,630
What is this?

24
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,140
What was I-

25
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,120
Who am I?

26
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,610
I can't remember my name.

27
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,510
What was I...?

28
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,970
Japanese?

29
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,390
A travel bag.

30
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,840
That's... me?

31
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,860
I'm a Japanese tourist, and...

32
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,210
Why?

33
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,430
Why can't I remember?

34
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,190
The ones who attacked me might be nearby.

35
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,830
Stop doing things by yourself, Clau.

36
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,510
What's the point of having me as your bodyguard?

37
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,720
Do you want a ride in my car?

38
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,670
Whoa.

39
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,590
I'll be fine.

40
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,460
I'm just going to check on things.

41
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,670
I can't let him handle everything by himself.

42
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,160
That snaky bastard.

43
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,690
He's probably having a blast with some extraordinary toy right now.

44
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,670
Jeez... He makes me want to puke.

45
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,540
But he's contributed a lot to the organization.

46
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,630
He's a favorite of McGuire and the others, after all.

47
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,510
Even though he's just a puppet.

48
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:46,880
It's Inferno's policy to make use of anyone who gets the job done, whoever that may be.

49
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,360
I know.

50
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,200
But seriously, Clau, you're skating on thin ice.

51
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,930
Call me if anything happens.

52
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,370
In that case, I'm counting on you, Lizzie.

53
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,380
If only you wouldn't drive like that...

54
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,730
Situation Assessment Ability: 074.

55
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,080
Awakening Value: 087.

56
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,980
I can't believe he's reached these values just minutes after waking up.

57
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,540
I told you.

58
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,860
He's an outstanding talent.

59
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,760
I'm probably going to Hell.

60
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,080
No, I might already be there.

61
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,320
That detecting ability just now was...

62
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,830
It's animal instinct.

63
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:14,570
You could see it as the id that was hidden inside the ego.

64
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:14,570
TLnote: Scythe Master is referring to Sigmund Freud's concept of id, ego and super-ego.
See Wikipedia for details.

65
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,590
But he's not quite there yet.

66
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,390
He hasn't reached the values that I'd hoped he would.

67
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,880
It's time for you to hit the stage, Phantom.

68
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,880
But don't overdo it.

69
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,130
Yes, Master.

70
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,290
If you don't want to die...

71
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,040
Those eyes...!

72
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,670
...you better come at me with everything you've got.

73
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,440
When one's heart,

74
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,250
life,

75
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:30,190
and very existence are in crisis,

76
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,030
the only thing that can fend off the hostility is one's instinct to survive.

77
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,590
Only weak individuals who have given up on life...

78
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,140
...believe that their safety is secured...

79
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:54,090
...by counting on morals or kindness.

80
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,410
I've come to loathe this world,

81
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:00,930
where such thoughts have become an everyday thing.

82
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,810
Well, if it isn't Ms. McCunnen.

83
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,530
If I had known you were visiting,
I would have prepared something.

84
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,280
What's our status?

85
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,530
The results should be out soon.

86
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:21,870
Would you like to observe?

87
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,510
Yes.

88
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,030
Please, come in.

89
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,450
Who is she?

90
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,040
Why is she after me?

91
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,460
I don't know what's going on.

92
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,580
I don't even know where I am.

93
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,020
Or who I am, for that matter.

94
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,120
I can't escape.

95
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,120
There's nowhere to go.

96
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,120
If I can't escape...

97
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,620
...then both you and I...

98
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,630
...must kill, or be killed!

99
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,320
It's starting.

100
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,110
Starting?

101
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,010
Please watch carefully.

102
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:48,500
Why?!

103
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,160
Come at me with everything you've got.

104
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,750
If you don't want to die.

105
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,880
I have nothing.

106
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,090
No past.

107
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,250
No future.

108
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,470
Not even a life.

109
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,840
Even so,

110
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,810
I don't want to die!

111
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,820
Where should I go?

112
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,450
I don't even know where I'm from.

113
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,300
I don't even have any memories.

114
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,800
What do I have to do to be free?

115
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,570
What kind of freedom requires you to kill people in order to earn it?

116
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,880
Tell me...

117
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,240
Please.

118
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,570
Where is this?

119
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,160
Who...

120
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:10,220
Who am I?!

121
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:16,580
Zwei.

122
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,580
You are...

123
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,060
I'm Ein.

124
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,590
You're Zwei.

125
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,160
Zwei?

126
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,590
That's your name.

127
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,660
Starting today, your name is Zwei.

128
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,100
Z..wei?

129
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,140
What... is that?

130
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,240
What kind of a-

131
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,690
You are me,

132
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,250
and I am you.

133
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,950
What do you think?

134
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,560
Isn't he a wonderful talent?

135
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:09,030
The results he gave us were unbelievable.

136
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,470
This boy had no training, and no formal understanding of tactics.

137
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,470
He took these actions out of instinct.

138
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,240
Furthermore,

139
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,820
he was able to overpower Ein for just a moment.

140
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,990
How unsightly, Phantom.

141
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,600
I'm terribly sorry.

142
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,030
He's a genius.

143
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:36,810
Not only that, but he also possesses abilities that appear when put under the pressure of a life-or-death situation.

144
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:42,250
It's almost as if he was born to join Inferno.

145
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,970
Even so, do you think he wants to?

146
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,080
No egg will refuse to hatch,

147
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,830
nor will any seed refuse to sprout.

148
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,760
His will is not the problem here.

149
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,820
And your specialty of brainwashing is going to solve that problem, huh?

150
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,300
It's perfect.

151
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,830
Using hypnosis and drugs,

152
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:05,270
we were able to seal away only those
memories that concern his own identity.

153
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,140
I beg you, please try to understand, Ms. McCunnen.

154
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,160
This is an act of benevolence.

155
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,160
Unfortunately, he happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.

156
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:24,170
If it hadn't been for us, he would have been killed as a witness.

157
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:30,760
But I wanted to give him another chance to live a fruitful life.

158
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,310
Traveling alone and Japanese, huh?

159
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,390
This could be trouble.

160
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:43,130
No one can trace his location anymore.

161
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,990
It's a complete secret now.

162
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,450
All right, Scythe Master.

163
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,070
I'll leave this boy to you.

164
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,110
Thank you.

165
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,690
But "Ein" and "Zwei"?

166
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,580
Couldn't you at least come up with better names for your students?

167
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:08,920
We'll see how long you can keep
ordering me around like that, Lady.

168
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:25,450
I'm the first woman, Ein.

169
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,330
You're the second man, Zwei.

170
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,940
We are...

171
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,230
What are you doing?

172
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,590
You've done your part, Ein.

173
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,120
Return to your post.

174
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,320
Yes, Master.

175
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,760
We are...

176
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,680
...ghosts that cannot exist anywhere.

177
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,130
We are phantoms with no identity.

178
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,040
Welcome back, Master!

179
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,360
Thanks.

180
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,790
Where are the others?

181
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,500
They're all resting, sir.

182
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,370
In the middle of the day?

183
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,180
What's going on?

184
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,190
You're...!

185
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,170
Phantom.

186
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,040
Phantom.

187
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,410
Inferno's best assassin.

188
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,320
A title given to the top sniper in the organization.

189
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,350
My masterpiece.

190
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,580
And him, as well...

191
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,180
You take things too far.

192
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:06,800
I see.

193
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:15,190
I guess that's the end for his organization.

194
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:20,190
With this, two of the five organizations in LA have been eliminated.

195
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,380
Everyone,

196
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,410
it all starts here.

197
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,580
We will create a new era.

198
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:38,460
The era of Inferno.

199
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:43,710
Ghosts that cannot exist anywhere.

200
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:47,250
Phantoms with no identity.

201
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,340
Only by killing...

202
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,730
...will you be allowed to exist.
