Dialogue: 5,0:00:24.68,0:00:26.77,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Well... it's not limited to spite.
Dialogue: 5,0:00:26.77,0:00:30.09,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But since it's a Snake Constrictor, it has to be spite.
Dialogue: 5,0:00:31.60,0:00:33.59,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Sengoku told me about it.
Dialogue: 5,0:00:34.21,0:00:36.85,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,She was cursed by a friend from her class.
Dialogue: 5,0:00:36.85,0:00:39.85,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Well, it was something like a hocus pocus spell.
Dialogue: 5,0:00:41.85,0:00:45.48,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Snake Constrictors aren't something an amateur could handle.

Dialogue: 5,0:01:08.00,0:01:11.30,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Then she figured out how to lift the curse, and performed the ritual.
Dialogue: 5,0:01:11.86,0:01:16.24,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Killing snakes to lift a snake curse sounds pretty dumb.
Dialogue: 5,0:01:16.24,0:01:20.81,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Actually, it got worse after she started killing the snakes.
Dialogue: 5,0:01:21.22,0:01:23.31,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,No, Araragi-kun.
Dialogue: 5,0:01:23.31,0:01:27.33,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Chopping up snakes to repel the Snake Constrictor isn't wrong.

Dialogue: 5,0:01:28.67,0:01:30.31,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Then why...
Dialogue: 5,0:01:30.31,0:01:32.19,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,The procedure wasn't carried out correctly.
Dialogue: 5,0:01:33.36,0:01:36.85,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Lifting a curse is harder than placing a curse.
Dialogue: 5,0:01:36.85,0:01:40.20,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Of course it's going to get worse if done by someone with half-assed knowledge.
Dialogue: 5,0:01:42.08,0:01:45.26,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,And it seems that she was pretty unlucky.

Dialogue: 5,0:03:51.10,0:03:53.21,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah, those scale marks will be gone too.
Dialogue: 5,0:03:55.16,0:03:58.55,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But to lift the curse, we have to carry out the ritual at that shrine.
Dialogue: 5,0:03:59.31,0:04:02.76,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It'd be best if we carry it out tonight...

Dialogue: 5,0:04:56.97,0:05:02.60,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Shouldn't being constricted feel painful?
Dialogue: 5,0:05:03.19,0:05:05.77,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Oshino said it should be painful.
Dialogue: 5,0:05:06.42,0:05:08.86,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But she's probably just holding it in.
Dialogue: 5,0:05:09.82,0:05:16.00,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But Sengoku's classmate didn't have to go this far just because Sengoku rejected the guy she likes...
Dialogue: 5,0:05:16.00,0:05:18.83,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Well, curses themselves aren't a big deal.
Dialogue: 5,0:05:19.61,0:05:24.80,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Well, it shouldn't have activated\Nsince it was placed by an amateur.
Dialogue: 5,0:05:26.72,0:05:28.17,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Then why...
Dialogue: 5,0:05:28.17,0:05:30.56,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,The procedure to lift the curse wasn't carried out correctly.
Dialogue: 5,0:05:32.18,0:05:35.68,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,And also, she was unlucky.
Dialogue: 5,0:05:37.44,0:05:43.69,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,The shrine where the young lady\Nchopped up snakes isn't a special place.

Dialogue: 5,0:05:56.95,0:05:59.58,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,That's also the reason why you didn't feel well.
Dialogue: 5,0:06:00.19,0:06:01.27,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Then...
Dialogue: 5,0:06:01.27,0:06:06.09,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah, the curse was activated because she was killing snakes in that shrine.
Dialogue: 5,0:06:06.51,0:06:09.87,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Nothing would've happened if she did it somewhere else.
Dialogue: 5,0:06:10.57,0:06:15.18,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,That's like putting salt on your own wound...
Dialogue: 5,0:06:16.67,0:06:18.29,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Then Araragi-senpai...
Dialogue: 5,0:06:18.29,0:06:22.49,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Wouldn't it be dangerous to carry out the ritual at the shrine?
Dialogue: 5,0:06:22.49,0:06:25.24,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Not really.  If we follow the procedure carefully,
Dialogue: 5,0:06:25.24,0:06:28.33,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,that place should make its existence stand out.
Dialogue: 5,0:06:28.33,0:06:29.66,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,So it's actually to our advantage.
Dialogue: 5,0:06:41.75,0:06:43.25,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Hey, Sengoku...
Dialogue: 5,0:06:45.03,0:06:47.30,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,What is it, Koyomi onii-chan?
Dialogue: 5,0:06:47.84,0:06:52.39,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Those scale marks actually hurt, right?

Dialogue: 5,0:07:09.29,0:07:13.78,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It feels like I'm being constricted, but I can hold in the pain.
Dialogue: 5,0:07:15.88,0:07:19.30,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It's weird that you have to hold it in.
Dialogue: 5,0:07:22.34,0:07:24.59,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It's okay to say it hurts when it hurts.

Dialogue: 5,0:07:27.92,0:07:29.91,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Restraining yourself for a little while is fine,
Dialogue: 5,0:07:29.91,0:07:34.08,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,but restraining yourself for a long time isn't\Nbecause it'll put a lot of stress on your body.
Dialogue: 5,0:07:34.08,0:07:37.15,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I don't understand why you thought restraining yourself is fine
Dialogue: 5,0:07:37.15,0:07:41.62,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,and why you ignored the psychological effects of it, Kanbaru.
Dialogue: 5,0:07:50.66,0:07:52.10,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Let's go.
Dialogue: 5,0:08:31.01,0:08:32.83,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,By the way, Sengoku...
