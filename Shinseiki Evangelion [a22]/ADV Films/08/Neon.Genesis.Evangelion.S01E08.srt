1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:06,301
Just like the cruel angel

2
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:13,981
Young boy, become a legend

3
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:28,090
Even though the untested breeze
taps at the door to your heart

4
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:36,390
You just look solely at me and smile

5
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:42,871
So intent on seeking out that gentle touch

6
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:50,881
Such innocent eyes, still ignorant
of their destiny

7
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:57,889
But someday, you are sure to realize
that upon your back

8
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:05,806
You have the wings with which to fly
towards the distant future

9
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:11,003
The cruel angel's thesis

10
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:14,740
Soon, you will take flight from the windowsill

11
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:18,511
With your torrent of ardent pathos

12
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:22,214
If you are to betray our memories

13
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:25,851
You, who embrace these heavens and shine

14
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:29,132
Young boy, become a legend

15
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:36,862
Correct, I have already arranged it
with the committee.

16
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:39,365
The cargo left from Sasebo Port yesterday,

17
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:40,916
and is now making its way here
across the Pacific Ocean.

18
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,539
A MIG-55 D transport helicopter!

19
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:51,210
I'd never have had the chance to fly in one
if it weren't for something like this.

20
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:54,491
Man, this is what friends are for, right, Shinji?

21
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,585
I figured you'd get claustrophobic looking at
the same mountains day after day,

22
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,722
so I invited you on a date,
since it is a Sunday.

23
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:06,892
What?! Then today is a real date?

24
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:11,530
I bought this cap just for today, Miss Misato!

25
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,432
So, where are we headed?

26
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,153
We're taking a little jaunt across the Pacific
on a gorgeous cruise ship.

27
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:23,542
Wow! Five aircraft carriers and
four battleships! What a fleet!

28
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,478
This really IS what friends are for!

29
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,614
That's your gorgeous cruise ship?

30
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:29,948
Yeah, she sure is gorgeous!

31
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,118
That's the pride of the U.N.,
the glorious regular carrier

32
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:34,019
"Over the Rainbow"!

33
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:35,421
It's huge.

34
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:38,557
I'm surprised that such a relic is still afloat.

35
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:39,892
Nabh, it's not so bad.

36
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,523
It's a vintage model from before
the Second Impact.

37
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:46,698
Give me a break!

38
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,567
Here comes the socket for that kid's toy.

39
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,529
What a child's errand!

40
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,781
Awesome! Awesome!

41
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:04,049
Awesome! Awesome!

42
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:06,118
Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!

43
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,219
This is way too awesome!

44
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,970
Real men shed tears for this kind of thing!

45
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:15,194
Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!
Awesome! Awesome!

46
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,155
Hey, wait! Wait up!

47
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,335
Damn it!

48
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,947
Stop! Stop already!

49
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:31,977
Hello, Misato.

50
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,280
How have you been?

51
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:37,049
Fine. How about you?
You've grown some, haven't you?

52
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,620
Yeah! I'm not just taller,
my figure's filled out as well.

53
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:42,988
Let me introduce you.

54
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:47,359
This is the pilot of Evangelion Unit 02,
the Second Child,

55
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,090
Asuka Langley Sohryu.

56
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:52,263
Episode 8

57
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:52,765
Episode 8
Asuka

58
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:53,726
Episode 8
Asuka Arrives in Japan

59
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:55,491
What did you do that for?!

60
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,106
That's the viewing fee.
Quite a bargain, don't you think?

61
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:03,267
What? Well then, take a look at this!

62
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,036
What the hell are you doing?!

63
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:12,351
So, which one is the famous Third Child?

64
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,253
Don't tell me that was him.

65
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,389
No, it's him.

66
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,593
Well, he looks kind of dull.

67
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:25,197
Well, well, I thought you were the leader
of this gang of Boy Scouts,

68
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,601
but it seems I was mistaken.

69
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,904
Thank you for your understanding, Captain.

70
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:36,905
Oh no, thank you for giving me the
opportunity to baby-sit some kids.

71
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:42,448
We appreciate your assistance
in the transport of Unit 02.

72
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,199
Here are the specs for the
emergency power supply socket.

73
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,720
In the first place, I haven't heard anything
about activating that toy while at sea.

74
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:56,395
Why don't you just think of this as
being prepared for an emergency?

75
00:04:56,396 --> 00:05:01,396
That's why the Pacific Fleet is escorting it.

76
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:05,704
When did the UN Navy
become a cargo service?

77
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:09,842
It believe it was just after a certain
organization was established.

78
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,945
Quite a grandiose escort for
transporting one single toy!

79
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:15,281
After all, this is the entire Pacific Fleet.

80
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:18,984
It's still not enough, considering
the importance of the Eva.

81
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,786
Would you sign this document?

82
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:24,123
Not yet. Eva Unit 02 and its pilot
have been entrusted to us

83
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:27,059
by the Third Branch in Germany.

84
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,295
You can't just do as you please!

85
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,163
Then, when will you transfer them to us?

86
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,966
Once we've unloaded in New Yokosuka.

87
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,702
The ocean is our jurisdiction.

88
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,637
You will follow our orders here.

89
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,272
I understand.

90
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,242
However, I should remind you that,
in the case of an emergency,

91
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:46,011
Nerv's authority overrides yours.

92
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,680
She's cool!

93
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,215
She's practically like Miss Ritsuko.

94
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:51,784
You're as gallant as ever.

95
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:52,805
Kaji!

96
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:58,424
Mr. Kaji, I don't recall inviting you
onto the bridge.

97
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,655
Oh, sorry about that.

98
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,293
Excuse us, then. We're counting on you to
escort us to New Yokosuka as ordered.

99
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,495
This is a date?
Excuse us, then. We're counting on you to
escort us to New Yokosuka as ordered.

100
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,264
Awesome! Too awesomel
Excuse us, then. We're counting on you to
escort us to New Yokosuka as ordered.

101
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:08,968
Shit! Those kids are really going
to save the Earth?

102
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,136
Times are changing.

103
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:14,373
I understand that Congress has also
pinned its hopes on that robot.

104
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,977
On that toy? The idiots!

105
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:21,078
If they've got the money for it,
they should give it to us!

106
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,054
What are you doing here?!

107
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,689
Accompanying her.

108
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,210
I'm on a business trip from Germany.

109
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:37,296
Man, was I careless.
I should have anticipated this.

110
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,164
Hey! Don't touch me!

111
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,399
I can't help it!

112
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,269
Squadron 3 will sortie as scheduled.

113
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,238
Seeing anyone right now?

114
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,641
And that would be your business WHY?

115
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,892
What? You're kind of cold.

116
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,580
I hear that you're living with Katsuragi?

117
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,415
Yes.

118
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,256
So, does she still toss and turn in bed?

119
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,590
Wha... wha...

120
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,141
What are you saying?!

121
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,995
So, she hasn't changed, has she,
Mister Shinji lkari?

122
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,563
Well...

123
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:14,033
Huh? How do you know my name?

124
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,567
Well, of course I do.

125
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,370
You're famous in our business.

126
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,741
The Third Child, who piloted an Eva
in battle with no training.

127
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,911
Oh, no, it was just luck.

128
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:29,102
Luck is a part of your destiny. It's your talent.

129
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,817
Well, I'll see you later.

130
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:32,284
See you.

131
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,925
This has got to be a bad joke.
No, a nightmare.

132
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,224
So, what do you think about
Mister Shinji lkari?

133
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:44,029
He's boring. That's the great Third Child?
What a disappointment.

134
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,600
Yet his sync ratio was well over 40%
in combat with no training.

135
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,169
No way!

136
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,038
That captain's attitude gets on my nerves.

137
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,140
He's a proud man.

138
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,810
Pride can make you sarcastic.

139
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:01,013
That Mr. Kaji is pretty lively and funny.

140
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:03,615
He hasn't changed at all, that jerk.

141
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:04,876
Hey, Third Child!

142
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,579
Come with me!

143
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:19,331
So Unit 02 is red? I didn't know that.

144
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,501
The color isn't the only difference.

145
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,636
After all, Units 00 and 01 were created

146
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,706
as part of a development process,
prototype and test type.

147
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:32,707
The fact that it synchronized with an
untrained pilot like you is proof of that.

148
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:35,180
But Unit 02 is different.

149
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,216
Created for actual combat conditions,

150
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:40,519
this is the world's first true Evangelion.

151
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,809
This is the final model!

152
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:45,824
What was that?

153
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,494
An undersea shock wave!

154
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:49,725
That explosion was nearby!

155
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:52,588
What's that?

156
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,237
Could it be an Angel?

157
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,848
That? A real one?

158
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,848
What'll we do? We have to get back
to Miss Misato.

159
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,630
This is my chance!

160
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:17,589
All ships take evasive action,
but watch the formation!

161
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,191
Where's the status report?

162
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:23,395
The Cymbeline's gone silent.
Titus Andronicus can't locate the target!

163
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,131
Damn it! What in the hell is going on here?!

164
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,100
Hello, Nerv calling.

165
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:31,470
Interested in info on the unknown enemy
and the appropriate countermeasures?

166
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:34,673
This is a combat situation!
No non-essential personnel allowed!

167
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:38,343
This is just my opinion, but I'd say
this must be an Angel attack.

168
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,074
All ships, fire at will!

169
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:40,712
Roger.

170
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:41,413
It's pointless.
Roger.

171
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,287
So an AT field can't be penetrated
with this kind of firepower.

172
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,199
But why is an Angel here?

173
00:09:58,965 --> 00:09:59,865
Could it be after Unit 02?

174
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:04,763
Hey, where are we going?

175
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,743
Just wait here a second.

176
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,280
What's going on?

177
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,352
Don't peep, you pervert!

178
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,353
Sorry!
Don't peep, you pervert!

179
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:21,814
Don't peep, you pervert!

180
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,918
Why are all boys such perverted jerks?

181
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,653
Here we go, Asuka.

182
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,242
Why won't it sink?!

183
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,353
I knew it. Only an Eva can beat it!

184
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:52,911
Come on, let's go.

185
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,887
You're coming with me!

186
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:02,094
Hey, why'd we change into these plug suits?

187
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,462
What are you, stupid?

188
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:06,073
What else? We're going to beat it
with my Unit 02!

189
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:11,236
No way! Do you have permission
from Miss Misato?

190
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:12,906
I can get permission after I've beaten it.

191
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:19,449
Now, I'll show you how magnificent
my piloting is, up close and personal!

192
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,492
Just don't disturb me.

193
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,494
This is odd. It almost seems to be
looking for something.

194
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,393
For an Angel to attack here...

195
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:36,261
Isn't it a little different from the deal we had?

196
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,230
This is what Unit 02 is for,

197
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:40,191
and I've generously provided
a second pilot as a reserve.

198
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:44,788
If worse comes to worst, escape by yourself.

199
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,196
I know.

200
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,277
LCL Fullung.

201
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,479
Anfang der Bewegung.

202
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,249
Anfang des Nervenanschlusses.

203
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,770
Auslosung von Linkskleigung.

204
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:01,686
Synchro-start.

205
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,593
Program error? What happened?

206
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:10,762
Thought noise! I told you not to disturb me.

207
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:11,830
What do you mean?

208
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:16,235
You're thinking in Japanese, aren't you?
Think in German.

209
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,838
Oh, okay. Baumkuchen...

210
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,639
Idiot! Just forget it.
Switch the base language to Japanese.

211
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,450
Evangelion Unit 02, activate.

212
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,419
Telex from the Othello! Unit 02 is in
the process of activation.

213
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,454
What the...

214
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,625
Nice going, Asukal

215
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,742
No! Abort the activation sequence!
Reset it!

216
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,963
Don't worry about him, Asuka! Just launch!

217
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,431
What are you saying?!

218
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:50,369
You can't just violate my command authority
over the Eva and its pilot!

219
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,204
What are you talking about?
This is an emergency!

220
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:53,905
Who gives a damn about your procedures?

221
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,408
Are you really serious?

222
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,839
Unit 02 is still using type B equipment!

223
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,947
Wouldn't it be bad if we fell in the sea?

224
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,448
So we don't fall in.

225
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,117
Shinji, are you in there too?

226
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:05,917
Yes.

227
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,519
Two kids!

228
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,288
Good chance to test it...

229
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,429
Asuka, launch!

230
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,159
It's coming!

231
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,949
Here we go!

232
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,435
Where is it?

233
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:23,669
That way!
Where is it?

234
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,540
That way!

235
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,339
We've only got 58 seconds left!

236
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,207
I know that! Misato!

237
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,377
Get the external power supply onto the deck.

238
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:33,578
Understood.

239
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:34,913
What is she going to do?

240
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,415
Okay, we're going to jump!

241
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,266
Jump?

242
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:42,714
Runl!

243
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,002
The reserve power supply is in place!

244
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,937
Reactor connection completed!

245
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,205
Evacuate the flight deck!

246
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,576
The deck is ready for Eva landing!

247
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,176
All hands, prepare for impact!

248
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,010
I can't believe this!

249
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,290
Eva 02, landing on deck!

250
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,157
What a waste!

251
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,118
Target is approaching rapidly!

252
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,895
It's coming! Port, 9 o'clock!

253
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,205
Switching to external power!

254
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:30,151
Switch completed.

255
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,105
But we don't have any weapons.

256
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,476
The prog knife will be more than enough.

257
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:44,750
It's pretty big.

258
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:45,771
That's what I figured!

259
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:49,621
What are they going to do?!

260
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,141
Hand-to-hand combat is the best way
to defeat Angels.

261
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,105
Good work stopping it, Asuka!

262
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,886
That's not funny! The flight deck is a mess!

263
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,950
Hey, they felll

264
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:19,851
Asuka!

265
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,042
It's impossible to fight underwater
with the type-B equipment!

266
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:25,232
You never know unless you try!

267
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,044
What a waste!

268
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,185
How much cable is left?

269
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,282
Another 1,200 meters!

270
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,243
What are you going to do?

271
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:52,961
We'll manage somehow.

272
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,925
I've got to do something.

273
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:01,622
The cable's going to run out!
Brace for the shock!

274
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:08,834
Shoot!

275
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,569
Eva lost the target!

276
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,350
Now's the time to change disks...

277
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,308
A Yak 38 Custom!

278
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,243
Hey, Katsuragi!

279
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:19,234
Kaji!

280
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,488
I've got something to deliver,
so I'll be taking off now.

281
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,667
Launch!

282
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,096
Take care of the rest of this,
Captain Katsuragi.

283
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,091
He ran away.

284
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,992
The target is approaching Eva again!

285
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,084
It's coming again!

286
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,396
I'l finish it off this time.

287
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,704
What?! It's not working!

288
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,138
That's because this is B-type equipment.

289
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,807
What're you going to do?!

290
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:49,808
What am I supposed to do?

291
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:52,329
You're pretty pitiful for being the Third Child!

292
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:53,795
Here it comes!

293
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,951
A mouth?!

294
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,242
Well, it is an Angel.

295
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,242
Eva 02 has entered the target's body.

296
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,696
Doesn't that mean they've been eaten?

297
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,776
It's practically like we're fishing!

298
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:15,648
Fishing? Yes, fishing!

299
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,938
We're right back in a pinch now.

300
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,049
Shut up!

301
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,509
Hey, get off me already, you pervert!

302
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,545
But we've got to free ourselves somehow.

303
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,146
Asuka, do you read me?

304
00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:29,667
Don't let go, no matter what!

305
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:32,250
Captain...

306
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,041
What?

307
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,103
I'm requesting your cooperation.

308
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,062
A point-blank assault by two
of the surviving battleships?!

309
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:41,660
Correct.

310
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:46,291
We'll scuttle two of the evacuated battleships
along the umbilical cable and set a trap.

311
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:51,069
During that time, Eva 02 will open
the target's mouth,

312
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,871
both ships will rush in,

313
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:55,574
fire all of their bow turret cannons,

314
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,035
and then self-destruct, destroying the target.

315
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,021
That's absurd!

316
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:03,143
Absurd, perhaps, but I don't think
it's impossible.

317
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:05,784
I understand.

318
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,625
All hands, abandon ship!
Repeat, all hands, abandon ship!

319
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,802
All frigates, hurry and rescue the lifeboats!

320
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,385
But what about the Eva?

321
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,562
Not to worry. They'll be fine.

322
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,663
Hey! Don't use Unit 02
without my permission!

323
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,069
Do the two of you understand the operation?

324
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,570
I'll do my best.

325
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:26,501
I'm counting on you.

326
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:34,379
Both ships have opened the Kingston valve!
Scuttling towards point Z.

327
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,413
Roger!

328
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:36,614
Cable reverse!

329
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,657
Eva has started to surface!

330
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:46,947
T-minus 70 to contact!

331
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:52,297
Hey, how long are you going to stay there?
Get off me already!

332
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,288
But we've got to pry open its mouth soon,
or we'll be killed too!

333
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,039
T-minus 60 to contact.

334
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,007
Status on the Angel's mouth?

335
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:02,240
It's still not open!
Status on the Angel's mouth?

336
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:02,851
It's still not open!

337
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,580
Both battleships are sinking
towards the target.

338
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:11,149
Eva is continuing to surface,
T-minus 50 to contact.

339
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,017
It's not working!

340
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,188
There's no time left!

341
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,426
Target has passed beneath the Tempest!

342
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:22,694
Speed of ascent increasing!

343
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:23,925
You're not going to make it! Hurry!

344
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,398
Don't get any strange ideas.

345
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:27,265
About what?

346
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,734
Anyway, just focus your thoughts.

347
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:30,635
I know!

348
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,438
T-minus 20 to contact!

349
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,049
T-minus 15 to contact!

350
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,245
Open! Open! Open! Open!

351
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,550
Open! Open! Open! Open!

352
00:19:58,497 --> 00:19:59,547
Fire!

353
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:20,336
New Yokosuka (Old Odawara)

354
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,822
You certainly went all-out.

355
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:26,603
I should have anticipated
underwater combat.

356
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,761
Oh, how rare. Remorse?

357
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:33,364
Who cares? We collected valuable data too.

358
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,325
That's true.

359
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,236
Misato...

360
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,769
This really is something special.

361
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,312
They MATCH!

362
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:48,833
I don't believe this!

363
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,716
They broke their synchronization
ratio records, didn't they?

364
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,407
For only seven seconds.
It must have been due to the danger.

365
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,889
Hey, where's Mr. Kaji?

366
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,320
He ran off. That idiot's got to be back
at headquarters by now!

367
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:05,959
It was a pretty eventful trip.

368
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,708
Was it caused by this, after all?

369
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:16,341
It's already restored itself this far.

370
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:19,912
It's frozen inside dura-bakelite,
but it's still alive.

371
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,549
Without a doubt, this is the keystone of the
Human Instrumentality Project, isn't it?

372
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,550
Correct.

373
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,652
This is the first human being.

374
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:28,443
Adam.

375
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:34,492
She may have looked cute,
but she was a real bitch.

376
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,462
Well, we won't have to see her again.

377
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:40,165
Yeah, though ol' Mister Big Shot
has to see her at work.

378
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,505
Man, I feel sorry for ya.

379
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:58,444
My name is Asuka Langley Sohryu.
Nice to meet you.

380
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:00,618
To Be Continued

381
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,108
Preview

382
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,088
Asuka and Shinji, who are on completely
different wavelengths,

383
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:12,257
are soundly beaten by an Angel.

384
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:15,927
Aiming for perfect unison between the two,
Misato comes up with a plan.

385
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:19,063
Next episode:
"Moment and Heart Together"

386
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:19,264
I'll give you more fan service next time!

387
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:21,232

Moment and Heart Together
I'll give you more fan service next time!

388
