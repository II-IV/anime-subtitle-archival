Shounen yo shinwa ni nare

15
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:35,795
It seems you've refused to allow
the interrogation of the pilot of Unit 01,

16
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:39,798
the only one directly involved
in the incident, Major Katsuragi.

17
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,035
Yes, Sir. He is very unstable,
emotionally speaking.

18
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:45,538
I believe that it would be
unwise to have him here.

19
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:49,241
Then, as his proxy, let us ask you,
Major Katsuragi.

20
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,643
In this incident,

21
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:55,247
did the Angel not attempt to
communicate with us, mankind?

22
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,984
I find no suggestion of that
in the subject's report.

23
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:00,419
It is believed to have been an irregular incident.

24
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,988
Assuming his memory is correct.

25
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,658
There is no evidence that his memory
has been tampered with.

26
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:08,761
However, the Eva's AC recorder
was not functioning.

27
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,061
There's no way to confirm it.

28
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:13,833
Was the Angel interested in the human psyche?
In the human mind?

29
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,835
I am unable to answer that question.

30
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:18,771
Whether the Angels even have
a concept of what a mind is,

31
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:21,173
or whether they can understand
human thoughts or not,

32
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,608
is completely unknown.

33
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:27,609
This incident has a new element in it,
in that the Angel tried to take an Eva into itself.

34
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:29,948
Is there any possibility that this

35
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,819
may be linked to the predicted Thirteenth Angel
and all Angels thereafter?

36
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,287
Based on the pattern thus far,

37
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:38,357
there is nothing to suggest such a systematic
organization among the Angels.

38
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:43,329
Correct! It is obvious that they have
worked independently, so far.

39
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,197
What do you mean, Sir?

40
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:47,233
You are not allowed to ask questions.

41
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:47,733
Yes, Sir.

42
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:48,734
That will be all. Dismissed.
Yes, Sir.

43
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:49,635
That will be all. Dismissed.

44
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:50,926
Yes, Sir.

45
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:55,841
What do you think, lkari?

46
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,577
The Angels are beginning to attain intelligence.

47
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:59,644
The time left to us is...

00:02:59,646 --> 00:02:59,912

The time left to us is...

49
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,715

Running short?

50
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:02,736
Episode Seventeen
The
Fourth

Individual

51
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,720
The patient in Room 127

52
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,855
The emergency room patient
from that E incident, right?

53
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,091
She's been hospitalized here for a long time.

54
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,760
I've heard her injuries are really complicated.

55
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,629
She's still in elementary school.

56
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,397
He's here again today, right?

57
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:22,368
Yeah, he comes to see her
at least twice a week.

58
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,503
He's a good and caring brother.

59
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:24,804
Suzuhara Empty
Empty
He's a good and caring brother.

60
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:28,941
Suzuhara Empty
Empty
Yeah, boys like that are pretty rare these days.

61
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:29,842
Suzuhara Empty
Empty

62
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,680
Rei, are you all right today?

63
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:38,350
Yes, Sir. I will go see Dr. Akagi tomorrow,

64
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,585
and the day after I'll be at school.

65
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,054
How is school?

66
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,189
No problems, Sir.

67
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,859
I see. That's good.

68
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,113
Stand! Bow! Sit down!

69
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,108
Today's absences are the usual Ayanami,
and Aida?

70
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:55,668
What's up with Kensuke?

71
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:57,369
What's up with Kensuke?
Mr. Koike is also absent today,

72
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,871
New Yokosuka. Chasin' battleships again today.
Mr. Koike is also absent today,

73
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:01,373
New Yokosuka. Chasin' battleships again today.
so the class in modern Japanese
will be self-study.

74
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,141
A ship called Myoko, or somethin'
like that, is in port.
so the class in modern Japanese
will be self-study.

75
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:04,310
A ship called Myoko, or somethin'
like that, is in port.
And finally, the student
on duty today will be...

76
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,244
Suzuhara.

77
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,978
Yes, Sir!

78
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,915
Deliver the printouts to Ayanami after school.

79
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,286
Yes, Sir!

80
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,787
Anyway, 1st Branch is okay, right?

81
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:15,321
Send the info from Satellite 5 immediately.
It's top priority.
Anyway, 1st Branch is okay, right?

82
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:16,555
Just the schedule for Unit 04 is fine.
Send the info from Satellite 5 immediately.
It's top priority.
Anyway, 1st Branch is okay, right?

83
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:17,590
Just the schedule for Unit 04 is fine.
Send the info from Satellite 5 immediately.
It's top priority.
It doesn't matter, we'll have the Magi evaluate
the data discrepancies from the sensors!

84
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,141
I'd like confirmation on the synchro data
and the S2 engine.
We'll get rid of the noise over on our end.
Just send us the originals.
It doesn't matter, we'll have the Magi evaluate
the data discrepancies from the sensors!

85
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,795
It vanished?!

86
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:25,531
You're sure the 2nd Branch just vanished?!

87
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,600
Yes, Sir, it's been confirmed.

88
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,891
It vanished.

89
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,470
Oh, man...

90
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:34,039
The Administration and Investigation
departments are going crazy,

91
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,975
and General Affairs is in a total panic.

92
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,076
So what was the cause?

93
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,644
We still don't know.

94
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,413
Our only clues are these
geosynchronous satellite photos.

95
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,224
There's nothing else left.

96
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:46,929
10 seconds...

97
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:48,788
8...

98
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:49,722
7.

99
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:50,689
6...

100
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,590
5...

101
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:52,525
4.

102
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:53,359
3.

103
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,226
2.

104
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,060
1.

105
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,351
Contact.

106
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:06,839
This is horrible.

107
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,840
Evangelion Unit 04 and all related
research facilities within an 89km radius

108
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,379
have completely vanished.

109
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,848
Along with several thousand people.

110
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:19,185
Looking at the time schedule,
we believe it to be an accident

111
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:22,388
during the experimental installation of
the S2 engine that was restored in Germany.

112
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:23,689
Potential causes range from

113
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,659
a lack of structural integrity to
a preliminary design stage error.

114
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,395
That's 32,768 possibilities right there.

115
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,497
And there's also the chance of sabotage.

116
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:36,168
But it didn't explode, it vanished, right?
In other words, it disappeared.

117
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,405
In all probability, they were swallowed
by a Sea of Dirac,

118
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:41,040
just like Unit 01 was.

119
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,309
And the S2 engine that we finally restored?

120
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,678
Gone. Our dream's been shattered.

121
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,681
That's what we get for trying to push ourselves
into using something we don't understand.

122
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,322
That goes for the Evas too.

123
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,753
So, what about the remaining Unit 03?

124
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,922
We're going to base it here.

125
00:05:56,923 --> 00:06:00,259
It seems the U.S. government doesn't
want to lose the 1st Branch as well.

126
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:05,260
They're the ones who insisted on
the right to build Units 03 and 04.

127
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:07,933
And now they're foisting just
the dangerous parts off on us?

128
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,568
Talk about self-serving bastards.

129
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:13,172
After a disaster like that,
anyone would get nervous.

130
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,307
So what are you going to do
about the activation test?

131
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,918
Will you use that dummy plug?

132
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,251
I've still got to decide that.

133
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,549
This is the dummy plug prototype.

134
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,818
Rei's personal data has been loaded into it,

135
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:29,279
but it's not really possible to digitize
a human mind and soul.

136
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,591
Ultimately, it's a fake, an imitation.

137
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:36,328
Just a machine that emulates
a pilot's thinking process.

138
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,064
It'll transmit a signal pattern to the Eva.

139
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:43,569
As long as the Eva believes there's a pilot
and synchronizes, that's enough.

140
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,438
Load the data into Unit 01 and Unit 02.

141
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,574
There are still some problems with it.

142
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,243
That's not important. As long as
the Eva activates, it's sufficient.

143
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,554
Yes, Sir.

144
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,917
I've delegated the transportation
of the Unit to the U.N.

145
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,219
It should arrive by the end of the week.

146
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,288
You take care of the rest.

147
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,355
Yes, Sir.

148
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:06,825
We'll perform the modifications
and activation test in Matsushiro.

149
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,227
What about the test pilot?

150
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:10,229
The dummy plug is still risky.

151
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,931
Of our prospective candidates...

152
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,699
We'll select a fourth, then?

153
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,370
Yes, there is one child whose core
can be prepared immediately.

154
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,471
Then I'll leave it to you.

155
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,762
Yes, Sir.

156
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,571
Rei, you can come out now.

157
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,678
Yes, Sir.

158
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,112
Let's eat.

159
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,403
Yes, Sir.

160
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:37,285
Stand! Bow!

161
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:42,761
Lunch time! Lunch time! This is the
single best thing 'bout school.

162
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,342
What?!

163
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,233
You didn't bring lunch?

164
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:51,337
I didn't have time to cook last night
because of homework.

165
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:54,878
And so you're telling me to go without lunch?!

166
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,162
What's this? Married couple fightin' again?

167
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,306
It's not like that!

168
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:06,975
What's all this formality for?

169
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,823
It's the Unit 03 activation test at Matsushiro.

170
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,258
We'll be using the fourth as the pilot.

171
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,460
The fourth?

172
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:17,029
The Fourth Child's been found?

173
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,530
Just yesterday.

174
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,633
But I haven't received a report
from the Marduk Institute.

175
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,804
The official documents will be
delivered tomorrow.

176
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,876
Dr. Akagi, aren't you hiding
something from me again?

177
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,344
Not really.

178
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,275
Well, okay. So, who's the selected kid?

179
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:44,156
Of all the people, it's that child?

180
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:45,591
It can't be helped.

181
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:48,127
All the candidates were gathered
together for protection.

182
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,696
It'll be hard to break to them.

183
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:54,500
Asuka will be fine. Her pride's
riding on her piloting of the Eva.

184
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,902
And Rei is an exception,

185
00:08:56,903 --> 00:09:00,706
but nothing good comes of becoming
involved with us and the Evas.

186
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:04,443
Shinji understands that better than anybody.

187
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,723
I don't want him to suffer any more hardships.

188
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:10,444
But we need children of this kind,

189
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:14,086
in order for us all to survive.

190
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,396
Let go of the pure ideals,
is that what you're saying?

191
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,801
Suzuhara, you're on duty this week,
so get to it!

192
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:29,868
What do you mean?

193
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:30,502
The printout!

194
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,370
Emergency Evacuation Training
Enforcement Notice
The printout!

195
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:31,703
The printout!

196
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,273
Didn't our teacher tell you to deliver this?

197
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:37,376
C'mon, class rep, you can ask
the other person on duty.

198
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,511
Miss Ayanami is absent today!

199
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,547
It's Ayanami and me?

200
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:42,978
Can't be helped then.

201
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,852
But I can't exactly go to a girl's place alone.

202
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,487
Well, in that case, I'll go along...

203
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,289
Shinji!

204
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,250
Walk home with me, will ya?

205
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,085
Ayanami

206
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,083
Ayanami, we're coming in.

207
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:21,220
I don't think it's good to barge into
a girl's room without her permission.

208
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:22,521
We've got no choice.

209
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,222
She won't see it if we leave it there.

210
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,117
Excuse us...

211
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,005
Wha?!

212
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:43,226
Is this a girl's room? It's so unwelcomin'.

213
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:52,853
Notice
Class News

214
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,895
Hey, you shouldn't touch anythin'!
She'll get pissed!

215
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:04,626
I'm just cleaning up.

216
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,966
1 ain't helpin'!

217
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,668
That's not a man's job!

218
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,598
Okay, but Miss Misato hates guys like that.

219
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,883
I don't care! It's my policy!

220
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,026
Man, what a change.

221
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:27,219
In what?

222
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,480
You.

223
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:34,871
The first time I saw you,
I really thought you were a jerk.

224
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,582
And you didn't seem like you'd
do somethin’ for others.

225
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,520
Well, I guess it depends on
what you've got to give.

226
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,013
We're visitin'!

227
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,014
What?

228
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,535
Those are the printouts that were pilin' up.

229
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,623
I'm sorry.

230
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:07,664
I took it upon myself to clean up a little.
But I didn't touch anything except trash.

231
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,743
Thank you.

232
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:21,293
Eva pilots sure are weird, all right.

233
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,406
Thank you...

234
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,586
Words of gratitude.

235
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,197
Words I've never used.

236
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,238
I'd never even said them to him.

237
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:52,471
The city, a paradise made by mankind.

238
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,774
Once driven from Paradise,

239
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,285
man had no choice but to escape to this
earthly existence, side by side with death.

240
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:02,281
Our own paradise,

241
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:07,119
created by the resourcefulness that this
weakest of beings was forced to develop.

242
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,721
To protect ourselves from the fear of death,

243
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,491
to satiate our thirst for pleasure,

244
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,862
a paradise we created ourselves.

245
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:21,233
This city's truly such a paradise.
A armed city made to protect us.

246
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:25,214
A city of cowards fleeing from
the outside world, filled with enemies.

247
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:32,244
Cowards do live longer. That's fine.

248
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:36,515
New Tokyo-3, Nerv's camouflaged
intercept fortress.

249
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:40,218
The continually-delayed seventh
construction phase will be finished soon.

250
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,179
At long last, it will be completed.

251
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:50,329
How will you report Unit 04's accident
to the Committee?

252
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,574
Just as the facts state, the cause is unknown.

253
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:58,236
But at this stage, it's a catastrophic loss.

254
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,472
Unit 04 and the 2nd Branch are acceptable.

255
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:03,008
Even with the S2 engine,
we may have lost the sample,

256
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,644
but we still have the data in Germany.

257
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:08,547
This installation and Unit 01 will be sufficient.

258
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,888
But the Committee was furious.

259
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,878
Of course, it was an unscheduled accident.

260
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:17,544
Seele must also be frantically
adjusting the schedule.

261
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:21,293
Incidents not depicted in the
Dead Sea Scrolls can occur.

262
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:23,254
This ought to teach the old men a lesson.

263
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:27,999
The Third District Transformation and
Direction Weapon experiment

264
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,400
is on schedule.

265
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:29,267
The intercept system here is finally
going to be completed,
is on schedule.

266
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,303
The intercept system here is finally
going to be completed,
Will Dr. Nishizawa of the Technical
Department, Section 3,

267
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:32,404
and there isn't even one measly party planned?
Will Dr. Nishizawa of the Technical
Department, Section 3,

268
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:34,139
and there isn't even one measly party planned?
call Section 2 of the Development
Division immediately.

269
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,873
Nerv sure is an uptight organization.
call Section 2 of the Development
Division immediately.

270
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,174
Nerv sure is an uptight organization.

271
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,724
Well, you know how Commander lkari is.

272
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:40,105
What about you?

273
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,881
Are you serious, Mr. Kaji?

274
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,917
I'll tell Miss Katsuragi and Dr. Akagi.

275
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,019
I'll cover up your mouth first...

276
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,755
So how's work going?

277
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,757
Oh, it's going, I guess.

278
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:54,128
Well, I have work to do. Excuse me.

279
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:58,482
Far be it from me to comment
on your private life,

280
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:03,635
but would you keep your hands off
our young girls in this emergency situation?

281
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,904
This isn't your jurisdiction, though, is it?

282
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,672
Could I hit on you then?

283
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,474
That depends on how you answer my questions.

284
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:12,345
You know the secrets of Adam down there
and the Marduk Institute, right?

285
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,846
What secrets?

286
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,415
Don't play dumb!

287
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,950
Asking for help isn't like you.

288
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,521
I can't afford to care right now.
I don't have that luxury.

289
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:26,525
What's behind the oh-so-convenient
discovery of the Fourth Child?

290
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,665
I'll tell you one thing.

291
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,631
The Marduk Institute doesn't exist.

292
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:35,300
Nerv itself is pulling the strings.

293
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,102
Nerv itself?

294
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,136
Commander Ikari?

295
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,472
Go check out Code 707.

296
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:41,762
7077

297
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,609
Shinji's school?

298
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,344
Miss Misato!

299
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,145
What is it?

300
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:50,282
Miss Ritsuko wants to see you about
the business trip you're going on tomorrow.

301
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,543
All right. Thank you.

302
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,485
I'll catch you later.

303
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:54,776
Yes, Ma'am.

304
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,859
How about it? Wanna go out for tea?

305
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,410
You know, I'm a boy.

306
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,459
I thought you'd be a more
serious person, Mr. Kaji.

307
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,673
Once you're comfortable around someone,
you sure don't hold back, Shinji lkari.

308
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,975
I'm sorry.

309
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,076
No, I'm sorry too. I didn't mean
to sound sarcastic.

310
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,931
I know! I'll show you something neat.

311
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,355
Are they watermelons?

312
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,786
Yeah, aren't they cute? This is my hobby.

313
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,390
It's a secret from everybody else, though.

314
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,331
Making something...
Nurturing something is really great.

315
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,032
You can see and learn so many things
from the process.

316
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,002
Like what's enjoyable.

317
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,293
And about suffering too, right?

318
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,064
Do you hate suffering?

319
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,611
1 don't like it.

320
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,041
Have you found anything that you enjoy?

321
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,917
That's fine too.

322
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:03,555
But knowledge of suffering makes you
all the more capable of kindness to others.

323
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,196
Because that's different from being weak.

324
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,348
Yes? Hello?

325
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,631
It's Katsuragi.

326
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,272
She says they're starting the synch test.

327
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,535
Fix the depth at 3.2.

328
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:17,402
I thought so. Shinji's synch rate is dropping.
Fix the depth at 3.2.

329
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,637
I thought so. Shinji's synch rate is dropping.
LCL thickness is nominal.

330
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:20,704
I thought so. Shinji's synch rate is dropping.
Harmonics level is negative 1.1...

331
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:22,107
What's that mean?
Harmonics level is negative 1.1...

332
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:22,807
I can't say.
Harmonics level is negative 1.1...

333
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:23,675
I can't say.
0.5...

334
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:23,842
But something must have happened
during that incident.
0.5...

335
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,143
But something must have happened
during that incident.
0.9...

336
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,012
But something must have happened
during that incident.
0.10...

337
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:27,846
Something psychological.
0.10...

338
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:28,880
Something psychological.
Current exponent is 0.9.

339
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,181
This makes it even harder to tell him
about Unit 03's pilot.
Current exponent is 0.9.

340
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,050
This makes it even harder to tell him
about Unit 03's pilot.
All results posted to Melchior.

341
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,952
But the pilot will be officially informed tomorrow.
All results posted to Melchior.

342
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:35,353
But the pilot will be officially informed tomorrow.

343
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:41,308
Stand! Attention! Bow!

344
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,930
Lunch time!
Toji Suzuhara of Class 2-A.

345
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,666
Toji Suzuhara, report to the Principal's Office.

346
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,134
What the...

347
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,425
Did you do something?

348
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,527
No, nothin' comes to mind.

349
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,474
Principal’s Office

350
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,510
Principal’s Office
Excuse me, I'm Toji Suzuhara.

351
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,412
Principal’s Office

352
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,280
Principal’s Office
You're Toji Suzuhara?

353
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:02,301
You're Toji Suzuhara?

354
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:07,185
How was your trip to New Yokosuka yesterday?

355
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,553
Way cool!

356
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:11,484
Speaking of which, I picked up
some interesting information.

357
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,060
Eva Unit 03?

358
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:19,097
Yeah, the one they were building in America.
It's completed, isn't it?

359
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,565
I don't know.

360
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:24,202
I know you've got to keep it a secret,
but please tell me.

361
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,071
I really haven't heard anything!

362
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,939
Haven't you heard the rumor
that the activation test

363
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,408
will be held at the second test facility
in Matsushiro?

364
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,443
I haven't.

365
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,378
The pilot hasn't been chosen yet, right?

366
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:34,899
I don't know about that stuff.

367
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:39,150
I wish Miss Misato would pick me for it.

368
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:42,954
Hey, Shinji, would you ask her for me too?
I want to be an Eva pilot!

369
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,264
Really, I don't know.

370
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:50,128
Then what about the story
that Unit 04's been lost?

371
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,162
What was that?

372
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,623
You really don't know about that either?

373
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,067
It disappeared along with the entire 2nd Branch.

374
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,470
I heard my dad's section was in a panic.

375
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,604
Really?

376
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,106
Probably.

377
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,887
I haven't heard anything from Miss Misato.

378
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:08,246
Well, I guess it doesn't concern
pilots out on the line.

379
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:11,497
If she didn't tell you, it's likely because
you don't need to know.

380
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,819
Sorry about bothering you with weird questions.

381
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:20,246
But Toji sure is taking a long time.

382
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,827
Thus, we, mankind,

383
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:27,766
survived the hell on Earth called
the Second Impact and rose again.

384
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,268
The number of children has
been decreasing yearly...

385
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,370
Sorry I'm late.

386
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:35,040
I've already heard. Take your seat.

387
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,581
Anyway, it is you, the younger generation,
who will lead the way to the future...

388
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,948
Come on, let's go home.

389
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:44,883
What about Toji?

390
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,985
He'll be late.

391
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,356
He's got class duty.

392
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,265
The school is now closing.

393
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:02,000
All students must go home immediately.

394
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,291
Suzuharal
All students must go home immediately.

395
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:06,687
You're on duty,

396
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,775
so make sure you line up the desks
and write up the daily record.

397
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:14,946
I haven't had lunch yet.
Il do it as soon as I've eaten.

398
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,816
Suzuhara, you always buy your lunch
from the school co-op.

399
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,657
It's not like I've got anyone to cook for me.

400
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,255
Suzuhara...

401
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:24,622
Milk
Suzuhara...

402
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:24,913
Milk

403
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:30,228
I have two sisters, named Kodama and Nozomi.

404
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,369
I always cook lunch for them, but...

405
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:34,999
Must be a lot of work.

406
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,204
So, I'm actually a good cook,
though you might not think it.

407
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:40,705
Really?

408
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:44,045
And I always end up cooking
too much for our lunches.

409
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:46,824
What a waste.

410
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,515
If you need help gettin' rid
of your leftovers, I'll help.

411
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:53,118
Yes, help me.

412
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:58,119
District 3 transformation test complete.

413
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,826
Mr. Kaji?

414
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,847
Oh, Asuka? Sorry, I'm a little busy
right now. Later, okay?

415
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,013
But you make time for Misato.

416
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:15,269
Hey, not right now!

417
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,358
These are our synch data reports, right?

418
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:20,845
Four of them?

419
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:22,926
What in the hell is this? What's going on?

420
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:26,084
Why is HE the Fourth Child?

421
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:29,053
No! I don't understand! What is this?!

422
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:29,220
Nerv 1st Branch, USA
No! I don't understand! What is this?!

423
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,411
Nerv 1st Branch, USA

424
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,480

Preview

426
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,457
Eva Unit 03 is delivered to Matsushiro
from America for the activation test.

427
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:16,678
Unaware of the coming tragedy,
people gloried in the last of their daily lives.
