Once again, I owe you.

16
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:36,729
You're not going to pay me
back anyway, are you?

17
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,098
About the materials they wanted under
Freedom of Information,

About the materials they wanted under
Freedom of Information,

19
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,868
First Interim Report Concerning
Objects Referred to as Angels
and the Human Instrumentality Project
I handled it by giving them
some falsified data.

20
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:43,235
I handled it by giving them
some falsified data.

21
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,905
The government is quietly
pursuing legal action,

22
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,973
but that will be blocked any day now.

23
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:52,678
So, should I do something about
that project as well?

24
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:56,115
No, judging by the material you sent me,
there should be no problem.

25
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,896
Then, I'll continue as planned.

26
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,625
That Which Is Manmade
Episode 7

27
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:12,528
Good morning.

28
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,927
G'morning.

29
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,448
This is the way to start your morning!

30
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,183
Not with coffee?

31
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:36,184
A traditional Japanese breakfast begins
with rice, miso, and sake.

32
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,126
You mean YOUR traditional breakfast.

33
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:41,793
What's that supposed to mean?

34
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:45,965
Besides, who was supposed
to cook this morning anyway?

35
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:50,835
Now I know why you're still single
at your age, Miss Misato.

36
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,372
Well, excuse me for being coarse.

37
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,174
And sloppy too.

38
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,677
Leave me alone!

39
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:58,968
I'm done.

40
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,215
Are you really going to come
to school today?

41
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,652
Of course. It's your parent-teacher
meeting after all.

42
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,521
But you're so busy with your work.

43
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,823
Don't worry about it. This is
part of my job too.

44
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,114
It's part of your job?

45
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:18,597
Yes?

46
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:23,102
Oh, thanks for coming all this way!
Yes, wait just a minute.

47
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:26,105
Miss Misato, please don't go out like that.

48
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:27,673
It's embarrassing.

49
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:28,964
Okay, okay.

50
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,046
Good morning, lkari!

51
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,515
We're taking off now, Miss Misato!

52
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:37,805
See youl!

53
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,280
Let's get going!

54
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,493
Ah, sarcasm.

55
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:50,974
Well, I guess it's good that he's loosening up
and expressing himself more.

56
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:57,703
Yes?

57
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,604
He just left. I'll leave guarding him
from here to you.

58
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,693
She's arrived!

59
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,661
Cooll Who is she?

60
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:23,896
Ikari's guardian?

61
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:27,199
What?! He's got a babe like that
for a guardian?!

62
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,070
They're such dorks.

63
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:33,739
Miss Misato really is awesome!

64
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,940
You think so?

65
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,477
It's even more amazin' that she's
Nerv's Ops Director.

66
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,648
You think so?

67
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:41,480
It's just a counseling session but
my mother had to dress up!

68
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,316
Good thing that Shinji's
such a baby, Kensuke.
It's just a counseling session but
my mother had to dress up!

69
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:44,917
Yeah, Shinji's no rival for us!
It's just a counseling session but
my mother had to dress up!

70
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:45,351
Yeah, Shinji's no rival for us!

71
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,186
Yeah, Shinji's no rival for us!
Don't you think she's silly?

72
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:50,823
You guys don't know what a slob she is.

73
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:54,660
Man, I wish I had a girlfriend like her!

74
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,729
I bet you'd have a tough time.

75
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,664
You just don't get it, do you, Mr. Big Shot?

76
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,834
All right, we'll leave protecting
the Earth to you,

77
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,794
so you leave Miss Misato to us!

78
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,141
Unit 01 has achieved the
required cooling level.

79
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,209
Please shift operations to Stage 2.

80
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,410
Protecting the Earth...
Please shift operations to Stage 2.

81
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,444
Protecting the Earth...

82
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,555
That's what Eva is for.

83
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,082
Come to think of it, just what is the Eva?

84
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,318
The entry plug smells like blood.

85
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,659
But I feel so relaxed here. Why?

86
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:25,713
In the end, I don't know anything.

87
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,795
What's the status of Unit 00's
bio-chest components?

88
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,497
It was seriously damaged.

89
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:35,000
We'll make a new one, but it'll barely fit
within our supplementary budget.

90
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:39,104
Will our job get any simpler once
we get Unit 02 from Germany?

91
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,773
It could go the other way.

92
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:43,742
Disposing of the Angel on the surface
isn't cheap, right?

93
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,846
Yeah, this place is really tight
when it comes to money.

94
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,148
We're talking about the fate of mankind here!

95
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,549
It can't be helped.

96
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,785
"Man cannot live by Eva alone."

97
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:55,921
All those survivors need money to live too.

98
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,389
Budgets...

99
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,158
So, is the Commander off
to another conference?

100
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,694
Yes, he's on the plane now.

101
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,215
It's nice and quiet here
when he's not around.

102
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,715
Excuse me. Since we're sharing the flight,
do you mind if I sit here?

103
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,512
The revised budget for the sample collection

104
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,314
passed quite easily, didn't it?

105
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:26,118
The Committee's main concern
is for their own survival.

106
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,254
They aren't stingy when their
own lives are at stake.

107
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:32,091
After all, the basis of their argument was
that no more Angels would appear.

108
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:34,493
Oh, I have one more piece of good news.

109
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:39,494
All members of the UN except the U.S.
have approved the budget for Eva Unit 06.

110
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:43,202
Well, it's probably just a matter of time
for the U.S. as well.

111
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:47,373
That country is allergic
to unemployment, after all.

112
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:48,707
And what about your country?

113
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,976
We will participate beginning with
the construction of Unit 08.

114
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:54,280
The plans for the second installation
project are still viable.

115
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:58,517
However, there is the problem of
not yet having found a pilot.

116
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,353
The Angels have appeared once again.

117
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,490
We have no choice but to defeat them.

118
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:08,994
We don't want another
Second Impact either.

119
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:13,933
Then you're saying that the Second Impact
that evaporated Antarctica wasn't...

120
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:18,934
Yes, the history texts say it was
a disaster caused by a huge meteorite,

121
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,271
Giant Explosion at the South Pole
Yes, the history texts say it was
a disaster caused by a huge meteorite,

122
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,441
Giant Explosion at the South Pole
but sometimes the truth
has been covered up.

123
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,976
Giant Explosion at the South Pole
Fifteen years ago at the South Pole,

124
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:24,510
Fifteen years ago at the South Pole,

125
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:28,847
mankind discovered the humanoid being
known as the first "Angel".

126
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,282
However, in the middle of the investigation,

127
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,385
for reasons unknown,
there was a huge explosion.

128
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,155
That is the real truth behind
the Second Impact.

129
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,624
Then, what we're doing here...

130
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,927
To prevent a probable Third Impact
from happening.

131
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,618
That is the purpose of Nerv
and the Evangelions.

132
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,522
By the way, the event will occur
tomorrow as scheduled.

133
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:51,893
I understand.

134
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,085
Good morning.

135
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,920
Good morning.

136
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,622
I'm going to Old Tokyo on business.

137
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,792
I'll probably be back late tonight,
so have delivery for dinner.

138
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:14,663
Later.

139
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,339
Okay.

140
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:26,623
Abandoned Zone 28 (Center of Old Tokyo)

141
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:36,181
It's hard to believe this used to be
the flourishing capital of Tokyo.

142
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,472
We're here.

143
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:42,354
Of all places, they didn't have to hold it here.

144
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,157
So, is the SSDF involved in this project?

145
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:49,094
The Strategic Self Defense Force?
No, they're not allowed to interfere.

146
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,765
No wonder they're doing as they please.

147
00:08:58,405 --> 00:08:59,238
Celebrating JA Completion
Announcement Commemoration

148
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,807
Celebrating JA Completion
Announcement Commemoration
Thank you very much for taking the time
out of your busy schedules today

149
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:05,744
Nerv Party
to attend the demonstration
of the new product

150
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,085
that we at Japan Heavy Chemical Industries
are so proud of.

151
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:14,616
Later, you will be observing the offical
demonstration from the control room,

152
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,623
but we'll be taking your questions here.

153
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:18,323
Yes!

154
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,124
Yes!
The famous Dr. Ritsuko Akagi.

155
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,493
The famous Dr. Ritsuko Akagi.

156
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,729
It is our honor to have you here.

157
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,964
May I ask a question?

158
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,900
Of course, certainly!

159
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,568
According to our earlier briefing,

160
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,603
this unit is equipped with an
internal nuclear reactor, correct?

161
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,373
Yes, this is one of our product's
most distinguished features.

162
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:37,910
150 days of consecutive
operating power is assured.

163
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:38,577
Nerv Party
150 days of consecutive
operating power is assured.

164
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:43,348
Nerv Party
But from a safety perspective, isn't
incorporating a nuclear reactor

165
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,919
into a weapon designed for
hand-to-hand combat risky?

166
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,923
It's better than a weapon that
won't work for over five minutes.

167
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:54,093
But in an emergency there could be
problems with remote control.

168
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,627
Still it's more humane than a system

169
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:59,598
that induces great mental stress,
and causes mental instability.

170
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,834
Cut it out. This just makes
you look childish.

171
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,802
And there's still the issue of manual control.

172
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:08,107
I believe that it is safer than a most
dangerous weapon

173
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,598
that can go out of control and run wild.

174
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,443
A weapon that cannot be controlled
is utter nonsense!

175
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:16,081
It's like a woman in hysterics!

176
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,372
Unmanageable!

177
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,654
That is what our pilots
and technology are for.

178
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:27,159
You're not saying that science and the
human heart will tame that beast?

179
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,427
Are you serious?

180
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,195
Yes, of course I'm serious!

181
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:33,098
Because Nerv depends on something
as unreliable as the human heart,

182
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,968
you've allowed a loss of control
such as we just saw.

183
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,471
That's why the UN had to approve
that colossal supplementary budget.

184
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:43,008
As a result, over 20,000 people
in several countries are starving.

185
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,544
On top of which, regardless of it having been
such a critical incident,

186
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:48,113
the causes of it are still unknown?

187
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:51,950
I wish you would at least fulfill that much
of your responsibilities!

188
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:56,522
Nerv Party
I envy you. Nerv is protected by a super-legal
act that allows you to avoid responsibility.

189
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,724
I envy you. Nerv is protected by a super-legal
act that allows you to avoid responsibility.

190
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,292
It doesn't matter what you say.

191
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:03,795
The fact is that only Nerv's weapons have
the ability to defeat the enemy.

192
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,764
You mean the AT field?

193
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,400
That's just a matter of time as well.

194
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,741
Nerv's day in the sun will not last forever.

195
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,379
Nerv Party

196
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:20,642
Damn it! Idiots! Who do those
fat cats think they are?!

197
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:24,650
This is just payback for getting
cut out of the profit loop!

198
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:27,352
 am so pissed!

199
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,887
Damn it! Damn it!

200
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,490
Stop that. This just makes you look childish.

201
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:34,560
He's just a show-off, begging for praise.

202
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,862
He's a small man.

203
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,998
But how did he even know
about the AT field?!

204
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,867
There's been a huge leak
of classified material.

205
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,538
What the hell is Intelligence doing?

206
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,827
We will now begin the JA activation test.

207
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,402
There is absolutely no danger.

208
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,175
Make yourselves comfortable,
and watch through that window.

209
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:09,661
Ready to activate.

210
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:10,862
Start the test.

211
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,231
Open all power circuits.

212
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,899
Pressure levels nominal.

213
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,567
Coolant system circulation nominal.

214
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,369
Release the control rods.

215
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,040
The reactor has exceeded threshold levels.

216
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,206
Output is nominal.

217
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,441
Begin walk cycle!

218
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,943
Walking. Forward ahead, slow.
Forward right leg.

219
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,723
Roger. Walk, forward ahead slow.

220
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,479
Forward Stop Reverse

Power core status nominal.

224
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:37,956
Roger.

225
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,891
Now, forward left leg.

226
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:40,942
Keep her steady.

227
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,133
It actually walks! I guess they did have
something to be proud of.

228
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:51,236
What's wrong?

229
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,037
This is odd. The pressure inside
the reactor is increasing.
What's wrong?

230
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,740
This is odd. The pressure inside
the reactor is increasing.

231
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:57,509
The temperature of the primary coolant
system is also rising!

232
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,777
Open the release valve.

233
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,178
Insert the neutron-deceleration fluid.

234
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,079
No effect!

235
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,450
The pump output isn't increasing!

236
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,153
Not good! Shut off the power.
Emergency stop!

237
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,644
Abort signal transmission confirmed.

238
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,823
It's not accepting it!

239
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,392
The radio circuit is being blocked!

240
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,027
It's out of control!

241
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,288
It can't bel

242
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,041
Run away!

243
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,239
That robot is as badly behaved
as the guy who built it.

244
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,785
The compression valve
is operating irregularly!

245
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:41,420
The control rods aren't working!

246
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,056
At this rate, a meltdown is possible!

247
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,425
I don't believe it.

248
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:51,426
JA's been programmed to handle
all possible contingencies.

249
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,233
This kind of thing can't happen!

250
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:59,004
Yet, the fact is, the danger of
a meltdown is now before us!

251
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:03,508
Under the circumstances, our only option
is to wait for it to stop.

252
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,043
And what is the estimated probability
of an automatic stop?

253
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:08,613
0.00002%! It would be a miracle!

254
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,083
Determined efforts are better
than waiting for a miracle!

255
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:13,118
Tell me how to stop that thing!

256
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,686
We've tried every possible option.

257
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:19,458
No, there's got to be a last resort,
a way to wipe everything out.

258
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:21,226
Give me the password.

259
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,995
The password to delete all
programming is top secret.

260
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,497
I can't authorize it.

261
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:26,998
I'm not allowed to tell you!

262
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,800
Then get the clearance!

263
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,031
Right now!

264
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,872
It's me. Let me speak to
Mr. Manda in Tokyo-2.

265
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,608
That's right, the Director of Internal Affairs.

266
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,949
Well, I've delegated this to Yasugi. Ask him.

267
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,083
I can't give authorization for such
an important matter on the phone.

268
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,619
Could you submit a formal written request?

269
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,889
So, I just need to get
Mr. Yoshizawa's permission?

270
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,759
Yes, I've already got an approval
from Mr. Witz.

271
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,861
Yes... yes, okay.

272
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:57,329
The evasion of responsibility...

273
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,264
A written order of clearance will be sent.

274
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,799
That will make this an official operation.

275
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,400
We can't wait for that! Once that thing
explodes, it'll be all too late!

276
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:12,077
Jet Alone is heading for Atsugi.

277
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,445
Time is running out.

278
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:16,448
From here on, I'll be acting independently.

279
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:17,516
Excuse me.

280
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:18,016
Nerv Party

281
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,017
Nerv Party
Hey, Hyuga?

282
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:19,451
Hey, Hyuga?

283
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:23,989
I've arranged it with Atsugi, so bring Shinji
and Unit 01 equipped with the F module.

284
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,557
Yes, this is an emergency.

285
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,926
This is pointless. Call this off,
Captain Katsuragi.

286
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,662
Besides, how do you plan to stop it?

287
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,393
By inputting a direct command manually.

288
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,269
Are you serious?

289
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,203
Yes.

290
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:41,840
But the interior must be
flooded with radioactivity!

291
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:42,841
It's too risky!

292
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:44,771
But if I make it, everyone will be saved.

293
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,982
The hatch can be opened manually
as soon as our control signal is cut off.

294
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:53,063
You'll be able to enter through the backpack.

295
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:55,767
"Hope".

296
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,300
That's the password to delete
the programming.

297
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,949
Thank you.

298
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,233
JA is the target.

299
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,936
There's a danger of meltdown
within five minutes.

300
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:15,407
Therefore, we cannot allow it to get
any closer to a populated area.

301
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:16,041
Hyuga?

302
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:16,741
Yes, Ma'am?

303
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:20,912
As soon as you drop off the Eva, break away
immediately and ascend to a safe altitude.

304
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:21,680
Roger.

305
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:22,414
And Shiniji...

306
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:22,914
Yes.
And Shiniji...

307
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:23,915
Yes.
Run alongside the target,
and place me on its back.

308
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,151
Run alongside the target,
and place me on its back.

309
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,754
Then restrain the target as best you can.

310
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,224
You're going inside?

311
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:32,791
That's right.

312
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:33,692
That's crazy!
That's right.

313
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:34,359
That's crazy!

314
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,462
I know it's crazy, but there
just isn't any other way.

315
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,264
But it's too dangerous!

316
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:40,532
Don't worry.

317
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:43,401
If it comes down to it, the Eva
can withstand a direct explosion.

318
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,937
Not that! I meant for you, Miss Misato!

319
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,974
Well, I've got to give it my best shot,

320
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:50,405
or else I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

321
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:55,313
Target sighted.

322
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,009
Here we go.

323
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,325
Eva in drop position.

324
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,560
Docking release!

325
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,850
Roger!

326
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,080
We've caught up!

327
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,251
We've got less than four minutes.
Put me on, now!

328
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,701
That's fine! Just do it!

329
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,393
Miss Misato!

330
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:57,831
Be careful.

331
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,748
Talk about hot.

332
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,350
This looks bad.

333
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,371
Stop, you bastard!

334
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,661
Miss Misato! Hurry!

335
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,418
This must be it.

336
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,399
Hope

337
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,412
Error?

338
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,433
What in the hell is this?

339
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,680
There's no doubt!
The program must have been altered!

340
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,765
The power reactor is just
0.2 short of critical!

341
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,834
The control rods won't function!

342
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:57,565
Guess it's time to sink or swim.

343
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,489
Miss Misato, get out of there!

344
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,330
Move, damn youl!

345
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:26,461
Miss Misato!

346
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,271
0.1 to critical!

347
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,173
It's no use! It's going to explode!

348
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,641
It's all over.

349
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:37,932
Miss Misato!

350
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,033
She made it!

351
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:02,967
Internal pressure decreasing!

352
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,335
All readings are nominal!

353
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,446
We're saved!

354
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,208
We did it! We did it! We did it!

355
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,843
That idiot.

356
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:13,745
Miss Misato, are you all right?!

357
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:14,779
Miss Misato?!

358
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,683
Yeah, but I feel like crap.

359
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:23,188
I'm so glad you're alive! Thank goodness!

360
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,499
Really, thank goodness!

361
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,494
But that was really amazing! I'm so
impressed! It really was a miracle!

362
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:30,829
Yeah...

363
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,379
But the miracle was set up by someone.

364
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:38,236
Recovery of Unit 01 is complete.

365
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,472
No danger of radioactive contamination.

366
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:42,040
Except for Captain Katsuragi's actions,

367
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,842
everything went according to plan.

368
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,133
Good work.

369
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,045
G'morning.

370
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,432
Now for a morning shower!

371
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,773
Where are my bra and panties?

372
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,307
Good morning, lkari!

373
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,742
Good morning.

374
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,177
I'm taking off!

375
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:20,468
Seeya!

376
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:26,017
Miss Misato is just so cool!

377
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,153
I thought so too,

378
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:32,874
but at home she's shameless.
She's so coarse, uncool, and really sloppy.

379
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:37,028
It makes me embarrassed for her.

380
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,759
How nice for you.

381
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,700
What do you mean?

382
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,470
He really is a kid.

383
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,704
Yeah, he sure is.

384
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,039
How's that?

385
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,976
She lets you see a side of her that
she won't show to anyone else.

386
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,647
That means she's your family.

387
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:00,964
To Be Continued

Wilhelmshaven, Germany to come to Japan!

submarine battle onto the activated Unit 02!
