1
00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:06,368
Just like the cruel angel

2
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:14,201
Young boy, become a legend

3
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:28,223
Even though the untested breeze
taps at the door to your heart

4
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:36,613
You just look solely at me and smile

5
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:42,971
So intent on seeking out that gentle touch

6
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:51,095
Such innocent eyes, still ignorant
of their destiny

7
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:58,129
But someday, you are sure to realize
that upon your back

8
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:06,040
You have the wings with which to fly
towards the distant future

9
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:11,237
The cruel angel's thesis

10
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:14,973
Soon, you will take flight from the windowsill

11
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:18,744
With your torrent of ardent pathos

12
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,448
If you are to betray our memories

13
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:26,085
You, who embrace these heavens and shine

14
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,366
Young boy, become a legend

15
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,702
Hey, Shin, did you change the soup stock?

16
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:45,543
Yeah, it's a bonito stock.
It's a gift from Miss Ritsuko.

17
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,679
That was HOT!

18
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:55,914
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:55,916 --> 00:02:00,753
You always apologize right away,
but do you actually feel sorry?!

20
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:05,754
It's like you apologize automatically
so that you don't get yelled at!

21
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,792
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,561
I'm sorry.
Exactly like that. You're just
fundamentally too self-deprecating!

23
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:11,364
Exactly like that. You're just
fundamentally too self-deprecating!

24
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:15,234
Now, now, that's just his way.

25
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:18,371
Just his way?! You're being too soft on him!

26
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:21,107
Haven't you been a little
too soft on Shiniji lately?

27
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:22,073
Have I?

28
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:22,608
Have I?
Maybe you and Mr. Kaji have hooked up again,

29
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,243
Maybe you and Mr. Kaji have hooked up again,

30
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,912
but don't project your happiness
on other people!

31
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,903
There's nothing between Kaji and me.

32
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:33,786
Hey, Katsuragi, I've found a bar
that serves a decent drink.

33
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,277
How about tonight? Bye!

34
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:41,661
Sure, I've never been involved in
an indecent adult relationship!

35
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,697
And here you're acting like a proper guardian?!
You hypocrite!

36
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:45,988
You make me puke!

37
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:50,393
Episode Sixteen
Sickness
Unto Death,
And...

38
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:53,839
B-type harmonics test, no problems.

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,475
Projected adjustment values have been cleared.

40
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,978
You look tired, Miss Misato.

41
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,280
Yeah, for a lot of private reasons.

42
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,214
Kaji?

43
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,948
Shut up!

44
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,418
Well, how's the Third Child doing?

45
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,486
Take a look.

46
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,777
Let me see.

47
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:13,659
I hope that knowing this
will boost his confidence.

48
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,950
Can you hear me, Shinji?

49
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,880
Miss Misato, how were my test scores?

50
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,953
Yes! You are Number Onel!

51
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:27,406
Oh, man! He beat us so easily.

52
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:32,210
To be honest, getting beat that easily
is a little frustrating, don't you think?

53
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,251
He's amazing, wonderful,
awesome, too awesome!

54
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,451
The great invincible Shiniji!

55
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:42,621
This just means we get to
take it easy now, right?

56
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:47,192
But I guess we should at least
do our best not to be left behind.

57
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:49,885
Goodbye.

58
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:59,171
New Tokyo-3 — Yumoto Station

59
00:03:59,172 --> 00:03:59,405
Please press this button
if you would like to get off

60
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,440
Please press this button
if you would like to get off
Next stop is Seisho Kabuse.
Next stop, Seisho Kabuse.

61
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,709
Next stop is Seisho Kabuse.
Next stop, Seisho Kabuse.

62
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,700
Convenient to the Bashar, used books
and video game stores...

63
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,305
All right.

64
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,242
Alert

65
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,048
Five minutes until evacuation of
the Western District is completed.

66
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,739
Target is advancing slowly at 2.5 kmfhr.

67
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:47,686
You're late.

68
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:48,387
I'm sorry.
You're late.

69
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:48,687
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,056
What's going on? What about
the radar observation center at Fu;ji?

71
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:54,160
They didn't detect it. It just suddenly
appeared directly above us.

72
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,796
Pattern orange. No AT Field detected.

73
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:57,730
What does that mean?

74
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,064
A new kind of Angel?

75
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,500
The Magi are withholding judgment.

76
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,520
Damn! Commander lkari just had to be gone
at a time like this.

77
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,282
Can you all hear me?

78
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:18,684
I've sent you all of the target's data.

79
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:21,086
That's all we know right now.

80
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,556
Approach it carefully and observe its reactions,

81
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:27,193
and, if possible, lure it into the airspace
outside of the city limits.

82
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:30,396
One of you take point and the other two
are backup, got that?

83
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:33,907
Ma'am?!  think Shinji ought to take point!

84
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:39,038
Well, this is a job for the
high-scoring, utterly fearless,

85
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,608
Number One synch-rate holder, right?

86
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,919
Or don't you feel up to it, Shin?

87
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:46,859
I can do it!

88
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,315
I'll show you how it's done, Asuka.

89
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:51,884
What was that?!

90
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,452
Hey, you two...

91
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:57,156
You said it, didn't you? "You are Number One!"

92
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,991
Well, that was...

93
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,026
Combat is a man's job!

94
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,928
Talk about out of date!

95
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,330
Unit 02 will back him up.

96
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:06,351
Unit 00 will back him up as well.

97
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,401
Damn kids, running with it...

98
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,971
Shinji's gotten to be quite admirable, hasn't he?

99
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,740
No, I'm going to have to chew him out
when he gets back.

100
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,991
You'll make a good guardian.

101
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:19,882
Power Source Ahead

102
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,964
State of Emergency Declared:
Closed to General Traffic

103
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,993
Ayanami, Asuka, are you in position yet?

104
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:37,663
Not yet.

105
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:38,397
You know there's no way
we could move that fast!
Not yet.

106
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,238
You know there's no way
we could move that fast!

107
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:48,747
Power Source

108
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,141
Not there yet?

109
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,353
Il go ahead and stop it on my own.

110
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,695
It disappeared!

111
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:10,496
What?!

112
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:11,196
Pattern blue! Angel confirmed!
Directly beneath Unit 01!
What?!

113
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,977
Pattern blue! Angel confirmed!
Directly beneath Unit 01!

114
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,057
A shadow?!

115
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,257
What is this?! It's weird!

116
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,715
Shinji, get out of there! Shin;ji?!

117
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,077
Ikari?

118
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:25,978
You idiot, what are you doing?!
Ikari?

119
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:26,709
You idiot, what are you doing?!

120
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:32,017
Miss Misato, what's going on?!

121
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:35,054
Miss Misato? Asuka! Ayanami!
Where's the backup?

122
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,555
Miss Misato?! Can you hear me?! Miss Misato!

123
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,490
Eject the plug! Send the signal!
Miss Misato?! Can you hear me?! Miss Misato!

124
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,326
It's not working! No response!

125
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,257
Miss Misato! Miss Misato!

126
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,698
Shinji!

127
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,719
Asuka! Rei! Rescue Unit 01! Hurry!

128
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:51,195
That idiot. What's the point of doing well
only on practice exams?!

129
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:55,341
It disappeared again.

130
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:56,575
Asuka, be careful.

131
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:57,866
A shadow?

132
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,346
No!

133
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,433
The city!

134
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,214
Asuka, Rei, pull back.

135
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:24,269
Bu...

136
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,637
Wait!
Bu...

137
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,248
Unit 01 and Ikari are still in there.

138
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,365
This is an order. Retreat.

139
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,041
This must be tough for Major Katsuragi.

140
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,092
They reeled the umbilical cable back in,

141
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,613
but the other end was missing.

142
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:50,629
Then...

143
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,365
There's not much energy
in the internal batteries.

144
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,467
But if Shinji doesn't just
flail around with the Eva,

145
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,669
and can hang in there in life support mode,

146
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,400
then he can survive for sixteen hours.

147
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,410
Second Tank Platoon deployed.

148
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,211
Roger. Hold your current positions and stand by.

149
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,680
Sub laser circuit has been opened.
Transmitting data now.

150
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,411
Confirmed. New line transmitting data.

151
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:13,174
The UN forces have completely surrounded it.

152
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:14,920
What about the shadow?

153
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,288
It hasn't moved.

154
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,792
It stopped spreading once it reached
a diameter of just over 600 meters.

155
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,861
But are the ground troops going to be any use?

156
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:26,031
They think they're applying pressure on us.

157
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,599
Good grief!

158
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,668
Taking matters into his own hands,
ignoring the plan.

159
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,271
Honestly, talk about getting what he deserved.

160
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:35,140
Just because he got a little better score
on yesterday's tests,

161
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,781
he was going to show me how it's done?!

162
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,337
What a big-headed idiot!

163
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,967
What? Is my bad-mouthing of Shinji
that much of a problem for you?!

164
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,522
Do you pilot Eva just for the praise of others?

165
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:54,593
No! Not of others! I do it because
I want to be able to praise myself!

166
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,054
Cut it out, you two!

167
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,350
That's right, he went out on his own.

168
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,480
So I'll just have to scold him
when he comes back.

169
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,813
I never thought sleeping
could be this exhausting.

170
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,200
Still blank.

171
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:38,891
No radar or sonar reflections at all.
This space must be too big.

172
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,834
It's been twelve hours since
I switched to life-support mode.

173
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,290
So my life will end in another four or five hours.

174
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,618
I'm hungry.

175
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:55,521
So, that shadow is actually the Angel's body?

176
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:58,457
Correct. It's six hundred eighty
meters in diameter

177
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,098
with a thickness of three nanometers.

178
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:05,230
The ultra-thin space is supported by
an inwardly-directed AT Field.

179
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:08,233
The inside is an imaginary space,
called a Sea of Dirac.

180
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:11,069
I think it's probably connected
to another universe.

181
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,704
What about the sphere?

182
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,985
It disappears when the imaginary circuit
of the body closes.

183
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,092
The object in the sky is the real shadow.

184
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,997
So the black shadow that swallowed
Unit 01 is the target.

185
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,216
Then there's no way that we can fight it.

186
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,092
The water is getting cloudy!

187
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,823
The purification system is giving out.

188
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,031
It stinks in here!

189
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,099
Blood! It smells of blood!

190
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,168
No! I don't want to be here!

191
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,571
Why can't l open the lock?

192
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,940
Open up! Let me out!

193
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,641
Miss Misato, what's going on?!

194
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,162
Miss Misato! Asuka! Ayanami!

195
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,401
Miss Ritsuko!

196
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,438
Father...

197
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,955
Please, someone help me.

198
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,890
A forced Eva salvage?

199
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,231
It's the only possibility that might work.

200
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:13,332
We would drop all 992 existing
N2 mines into its center,

201
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:17,135
while simultaneously activating the
AT Fields of the remaining Evas,

202
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:20,505
disrupting the Angel's imaginary circuit
for one millisecond.

203
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,742
In that instant, we'll concentrate
all the explosive energy,

204
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,511
and destroy the Angel along
with the Sea of Dirac that forms it.

205
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:30,315
But with that, the body of the Eva...
There's no telling what would happen to Shiniji.

206
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,050
That can't be called a rescue operation!

207
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:35,487
This operation's top priority is
to recover Unit 01 itself.

208
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,889
Heavy damage to the body is irrelevant.

209
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,224
Now wait a second!

210
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,505
In this case, the pilot's life is not our concern.

211
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:51,597
If Shinji's lost, it's your fault. Don't forget that!

212
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:56,652
Why are you and Commander lkari
so worried about Unit 01?

213
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,512
What in the hell is an Eva?

214
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,748
I've given you all the information.

215
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,039
You're lying!

216
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,868
Misato, trust me.

217
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:15,592
I'm taking command of this entire operation.

218
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:21,900
We'll be sending some flights to
Kansai International Airport as well.

219
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,536
Contact Air Traffic Control and the
JADF's Air Transport divisions.

220
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,737
Roger.

221
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:30,142
The Second Impact, the
Instrumentality Project, Adam...

222
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,013
There are still secrets that I'm in the dark about.

223
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,525
Who's there?

224
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:46,795
Who's there?

225
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,828
Shinji Ikari.

226
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,430
That's me.

227
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:55,211
I am you. People have another
self within themselves.

228
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,549
The self is always composed of two people.

229
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,405
Two people?

230
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:04,142
The self which is actually seen,
and the self observing that.

231
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:07,145
There are many entities called Shinji lkari.

232
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:10,549
The other Shiniji Ikari that exists in your mind.

233
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,485
The Shiniji Ikari in Misato Katsuragi's mind,

234
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,253
the Shinji in Asuka Sohryu,

235
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,755
the Shinji in Rei Ayanami,

236
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:18,724
and the Shinji in Gendo lkari.

237
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:20,992
All are different Shinji lkaris,

238
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,295
but each of them is a true Shinji lkari.

239
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:26,765
You are afraid of those Shiniji lkaris
in other people's minds.

240
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:29,101
I'm afraid of other people hating me.

241
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:31,031
You're afraid of being hurt.

242
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,306
Who is at fault?

243
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,074
Father is the one who is at fault.

244
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,043
The father who deserted me.

245
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,277
It's my fault.

246
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,147
There you go, always immediately thinking
that it's your fault!

247
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:43,928
That's why I say you're self-deprecating!

248
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,618
I can't do anything.

249
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,519
You just believe that you can't do anything.

250
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,032
Don't you have faith in your father?

251
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:55,961
I think I hate him, but now I'm not sure.

252
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:58,363
Good work, Shiniji.

253
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:02,524
My father called me by my name.
I was praised by my father!

254
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:07,472
You're going to spend the rest of your life
ruminating on that happiness?

255
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,842
If I believe in those words, I can keep on living.

256
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,611
As you continue to deceive yourself?

257
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:15,714
Everybody does it!
That's how everyone survives.

258
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:18,350
Believe that you're fine with the way things are,

259
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,452
or you won't be able to keep living.

260
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:24,589
There's too much hardship in this world
for me to keep living.

261
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,057
For example, the fact you can't swim?

262
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,160
Humans aren't made to float!

263
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:29,261
That is self-deception.

264
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,842
I don't care what you call it!

265
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,901
You've shut your eyes and turned a deaf ear
to the things you don't like.

266
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:38,203
His sister was injured during the incident.

267
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:39,843
Who cares what the others say?!

268
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:41,840
Leave!

269
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:43,391
No, I don't want to hear this!

270
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:46,521
See? You're running away again.

271
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:53,051
There's no way you can live by linking
just the enjoyable moments like a rosary.

272
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,120
Especially not me.

273
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,155
I've found something I enjoy!

274
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:00,292
Finding something you enjoy
and doing nothing but that...

275
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,813
What's wrong with that?!

276
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:07,065
In theory, the entry plug's energy reserves

277
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,000
should be reaching their expiration point.

278
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,810
The plug suit's life support system
will be getting close to redline.

279
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,073
Advance the schedule by twelve minutes.

280
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,733
Let's do it while there's a chance
that Shinji's still alive.

281
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,705
Father, am I unwanted?

282
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,531
Father!

283
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:41,522

00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,714
You did a very praiseworthy thing today.

344
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,811
Shinji, you must not run away.

345
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,324
Do your best.

346
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,644
I hate this place.

347
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,079
I don't want to be alone...

348
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,829
...anymore.

349
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,004
The heating and the oxygen circulation
are already out.

350
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,527
I'm cold.

351
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:24,163
It's useless, the suit is giving out too.

352
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,886
So this is the end.

353
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,768
I'm tired...

354
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,741
Of it all.

355
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:08,676
Mother?

356
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:17,952
Are you ready?

357
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,953
Well, that's good for you.

358
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,273
Both Evas are in position.

359
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,442
AT field generation ready.

360
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,309
Roger.

361
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,040
Sixty seconds to mine drop.

362
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:39,841
What's happening?!

363
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:45,657
Status report!

364
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:46,725
Unknown!

365
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:49,527
All meters and gauges are going off the scale.

366
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,229
But we haven't done anything yet.

367
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,497
No way, Shinji?!

368
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:53,698
It's impossible!

369
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,539
Unit 01's power level is zero!

370
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,074
I'm piloting something like that?

371
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:35,307
What kind... what kind of monster
have we copied from?

372
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:39,262
I know that the Evas aren't just
copies of the First Angel.

373
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:44,676
But what is Nerv going to do with them
once all the Angels have been destroyed?

374
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:24,126
Shinji?! Shinji?! Shinji?!

375
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,135
Shinji?! Are you all right, Shinji?!

376
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:39,312
I just wanted to see you one more time.

377
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,517
Weren't you going to scold him?

378
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:52,228
I have never thought these Evas
were as frightening as I did today.

379
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,349
Are the Evas really on our side?

380
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,085
They may hate us.

381
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,699
I think that Major Katsuragi
may have noticed something.

382
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:07,065
I see. Let her be for now.

383
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:09,834
If Rei or Shinji were to find out the Eva's secrets,

384
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,445
they'd never forgive us, would they?

385
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:28,197
Stay in bed for today.
We'll take care of the rest.

386
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,090
But I'm fine now.

387
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:33,731
Well, that's good for you.

388
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,117
The smell of blood won't come off.

389
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:00,898

Eva Unit 04, which was being built in America,

392
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,788
Eva Unit 04, which was being built in America,

393
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,358
vanished along with Nerv's 2nd Branch.

394
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,259
This incident forces them
to select a new Eva pilot.
