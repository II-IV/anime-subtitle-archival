1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:06,468
Just like the cruel angel

2
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:14,147
Young boy, become a legend

3
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:28,257
Even though the untested breeze
taps at the door to your heart

4
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:36,557
You just look solely at me and smile

5
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:43,038
So intent on seeking out that gentle touch

6
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:51,035
Such innocent eyes, still ignorant
of their destiny

7
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:58,025
But someday, you are sure to realize
that upon your back

8
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:05,943
You have the wings with which to fly
towards the distant future

9
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:11,170
The cruel angel's thesis

10
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:14,907
Soon, you will take flight from the windowsill

11
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:18,643
With your torrent of ardent pathos

12
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:22,381
If you are to betray our memories

13
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:26,018
You, who embrace these heavens and shine

14
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:29,299
Young boy, become a legend

15
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,179
Katsuragi, it's me.

16
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,658
I've probably put you through a lot of trouble
by the time you're listening to this.

17
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,368
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,039
Tell Ritchan I said I'm sorry too.

19
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,872
Also, since I've troubled you
so much anyway,

20
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,603
there's this flower I've been growing...

21
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,199
I1t'd make me happy if you'd water it for me.

22
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,692
Shinji knows where it is.

23
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:56,958
Katsuragi, the truth is with you.

24
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,408
Go forward without any hesitation.

25
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,590
If I ever get to see you again,

26
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,704
I'll say the words I wasn't able
to say eight years ago.

27
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,750
Bye.

28
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,333
The phone that won't ring...

29
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,399
Sorry, but don't
bother me.
Working

30
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,505
Miss Misato's still cooped up today.

31
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,876
Do not enter without permission.
If you do,
1"l kill you!

32
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,045
Asuka...

33
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:27,916
I wonder if she won't be coming
back again today?

34
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,490
She won't go to school and
she won't go back home.

35
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,914
She just keeps playing games.

36
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:45,930
Hikari?

37
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,233
What is it?

38
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:48,464
Wanna go to sleep?

39
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,089
Okay...

40
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,977
I'm sorry. Am I a bother?

41
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,504
No, not at all.

42
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,510
 wasn't able to win in my Eva.

43
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:23,202
I'm not worth anything anymore.

44
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,343
Not anywhere.

45
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:29,159
I hate it. I hate it all. I hate everyone.

46
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:33,398
But what I hate the most is myself.

47
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,881
Somehow, I feel like nothing matters anymore.

48
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:43,122
I think it's okay for you to do whatever
you want and I won't say anything,

49
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:45,173
because I think you did your best, Asuka.

50
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,806
I see, so she passed away.

51
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,643
Yes, probably, even cats eventually
reach the end of their lives.

52
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,520
Don't cry anymore, Grandma.

53
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,693
I will. When I get some time,
I'l come home for a bit.

54
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,703
I haven't visited Mother's grave
in three years either.

55
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,466
I'll call you next time.

56
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:17,766
Okay, I'm hanging up now.

57
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,132
So, she died.

58
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,460
Episode Twenty-Three
Tears

59
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:30,936
It is impossible for us to recover
the Lance of Longinus.

60
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,505
Why did you use it?

61
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:35,635
We still do not have the planned number
of the Eva series.

62
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,111
I made destroying the Angel my first priority.

63
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,780
It was an unavoidable situation.

64
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,648
Unavoidable, was it?

65
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,818
You should make your excuses
more convincing than that.

66
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,979
Your recent actions have become intolerable.

67
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,847
Fuyutsuki, we're in the middle
of deliberations here.

68
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,138
All right.

69
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:59,331
An Angel is currently drawing near.

70
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,066
Let us continue this at another time.

71
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,557
If your seat is still waiting for you, that is.

72
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,475
Ikari... Does he intend to betray Seele?

73
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,677
I'll be there in fifteen minutes.

74
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:15,048
Launch Unit 00 from Number 32.
Send Unit 02 as backup.

75
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,084
That's right, Commander lkari's orders
still stand for Unit 01.

76
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,720
I don't have the authority to lift
the suspension on it.

77
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:22,681
Bye.

78
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,402
Visual confirmation of the Angel...

79
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,219
Unit 00 launched, heading for intercept point.

80
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,467
Unit 02 on standby at current location.

81
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:36,969
No, launch her.

82
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,037
Commander!

83
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,318
It doesn't matter. She can at least
serve as a decoy.

84
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,174
Yes, Sir.

85
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,815
Eva Unit 02, prepare for launch.

86
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,346
Here I am, shamelessly back in the pilot's seat.

87
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,715
I'm so bad at letting things go.

88
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,617
Unit 02, please go to Gate 8.

89
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,808
Launch as soon as your deployment
position has been determined.

90
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,524
Il only be in the way, even if I go out there.

91
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,827
Target approaching. It has crossed
the Gora Final Line of Defense.

92
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,438
I don't care anymore.

93
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,484
Target hovering over Ohwakudani,
continuing to rotate in place.

94
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,489
Target's AT Field is still active.

95
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:20,880
What were you doing?

96
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,381
I won't waste time on excuses.

97
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,482
What's the situation?

98
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,651
We've been in a persistent deadlock.

99
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:29,054
Pattern cycling from blue to orange!

100
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,122
What does that mean?

101
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,524
Magi indicates it cannot find a solution.

102
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,261
We don't have enough data
to come to an answer.

103
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:37,952
But one thing's certain.
That shape isn't a fixed form.

104
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,784
So we can't make the first move.

105
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:44,136
Rei, we're going to wait and watch for a while.

106
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,187
No, it's coming.

107
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,143
Rei, counter it!

108
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,874
It's no use! She won't make it in time!

109
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,155
Target is in physical contact with Unit 00!

110
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,124
How is Unit 00's AT Field?!

111
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,260
Operational, but the Angel is eroding it!

112
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,730
The Angel is aggressively seeking
to make first contact?

113
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:12,841
With Unit 00?

114
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,641
Danger!

115
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,177
It's invading Unit 00's organic parts!

116
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,378
Launch Eva Unit 02!

117
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,677
Send her to rescue and back up Reil

118
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,569
Target making further inroads!

119
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,288
This is dangerous.

120
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,869
Over five percent has been
biologically fused already.

121
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,967
Asuka, close your distance by 300,
deploy your AT Field at maximum,

122
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,169
and fire the Palette Gun into the target's rear!

123
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,630
Got it? Eva Unit 02, lift off!

124
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,377
Move out, Asuka. What's the matter?
What's wrong with Unit 02?!

125
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:00,813
It's no good! The synch rate
is in the single digits!

126
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:01,454
Asuka!

127
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,213
It won't move. It just won't move!

128
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,121
She'll only be a sitting duck out there!

129
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,642
Bring her back! Quickly!

130
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:22,134
Who's there?

131
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,535
Me?

132
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,146
The me inside the Eva.

133
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:28,543
No, I can sense that there's
someone other than me.

134
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:30,843
Who are you?

135
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,744
An Angel? The person that we call an Angel?

136
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,082
Won't you become one with me?

137
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:40,183
No. I am me. I am not you.

138
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:44,658
I see, but it's no use. It's too late now.

139
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:50,117
I'll share what's in my heart with you.

140
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,487
I'll share this feeling with you.

141
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:58,948
Doesn't it hurt? See?
Doesn't your heart ache?

142
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,193
Hurt? No, you're wrong. It's...

143
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:05,377
...loneliness?

144
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,078
Yes, it's loneliness, isn't it?

145
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:11,016
Loneliness? I don't understand.

146
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,797
You hate being alone, don't you?

147
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,424
There are so many of us, and yet,
you hate being alone.

148
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,505
That is what loneliness is.

149
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,337
That is what is inside your heart.

150
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,177
That is your own heart, overflowing with sorrow.

151
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,050
These are tears?

152
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,556
The one crying is me?

153
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,743
Rei!

154
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:41,413
The suspension on Unit 01
has been lifted as of now.

155
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,644
Send him out immediately.

156
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,384
Send him out.

157
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:46,405
Yes, Sir.

158
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,867
What? You didn't send him out for me.

159
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:06,138
Deploy your AT Field. Rescue Rei immediately.

160
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,159
Okay!

161
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:09,985
Ikari?

162
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:17,387
This is my heart wanting to
become one with Ikari?

163
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,910
No.

164
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,589
The AT Field has been reversed!

165
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,124
It will be eroded away at once!

166
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,758
Does she intend to contain the Angel?!

167
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,689
Rei, abandon the Eva and get out of there!

168
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:30,662
No.

169
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,503
If I go, the AT Field will disappear.

170
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:35,790
So, l can't.

171
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:40,245
Rei, do you mean to die?

172
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,713
The core is collapsing!
Critical point exceeded!

173
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:12,906
Target has been destroyed.

174
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,844
At this time, this operation is officially over.

175
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,345
Change our status to Class One Alert.

176
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,348
Roger that. Switching immediately
to Condition Yellow.

177
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,516
What about Unit 00's status?

178
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,553
Ejection of the entry plug
has not been confirmed.

179
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:30,122
Hurry the rescue operation for the survivor.

180
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:31,463
If there is one, that is.

181
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,943
No antibiotic substance from the 16th Angel
has been found thus far.

182
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:51,410
We will continue searching.

183
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,011
Level C traces are spreading
towards the southwest.

Dr. Akagi!

186
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:55,308
Dr. Akagi!

187
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,951
What happened here will be
classified top secret.

188
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:02,254
Take back the plug. Dispose of everything else.

189
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,188
Roger that.

190
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,858
Let's get to work! Quickly!

191
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:06,295

the 16th Angel.

205

The 8th Angel

206
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:10,362
That leaves only one Angel described
in Seele's Dead Sea Scrolls.

223
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:14,633
The 14th Angel
That leaves only one Angel described
in Seele's Dead Sea Scrolls.

224
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:14,866
The promised time is near.

225
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:15,133
Zeruel
The promised time is near.

226
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:15,367
The 15th Angel
The promised time is near.

227
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:15,634
The promised time is near.

228
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:15,867
Ariel
The promised time is near.

229
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:16,134
The 16th Angel
The promised time is near.

230
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:16,368
The promised time is near.

231
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:16,569
Armisael
The promised time is near.

232
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:20,583
Our journey has been long and the
sacrifices have been great.

233
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,809
Indeed, first, the Lance of Longinus,

234
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,944
and now, the loss of Unit 00.

235
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:29,114
We have more than enough reasons
to relieve lkari of his command.

236
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,183
That man is smart enough
to know the significance

237
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,118
of why we allowed Fuyutsuki to return safely.

238
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:37,022
We need another human sacrifice
to counter lkari.

239
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:39,273
And we need someone who knows the truth.

240
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,135
Shinji, I'm coming in.

241
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,257
Miss Misato, the tears won't come.

242
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,749
I feel sad, but the tears just won't come.

243
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,240
Shiniji, this is about all I can
do for you right now.

244
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,508
Stop it!

245
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:30,849
Stop it, Miss Misato.

246
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,334
I'm sorry.

247
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,811
But he must be feeling lonely.

248
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,721
Is he afraid of women?

249
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,862
No, he's afraid of being intimate with people.

250
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,563
Pen Pen, come here.

251
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,962
I see, it doesn't matter who.

252
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,505
I am the one who is lonely.

253
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,511
Yes, hello?

254
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,050
What did you say?!

255
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,051
Shinji!

256
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,121
Dr. Godai of Internal Medicine 1, Dr. Godai.

257
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:18,202
Please contact Conference Room 2 immediately.

258
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,545
Ayanami!

259
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,528
Neurosurgery 1
Surgery 3 2nd Floor Ward
Diagnostic Radiology
X-ray Information Desk

260
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,655
I'm so glad you're okay.

261
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,709
I guess my dad's not here.

262
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,607
Thank you for saving me.

263
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,075
What do you mean?

264
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:41,176
What do I mean? You sacrificed
Unit 00 to save me.

265
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,616
I see, so I saved you.

266
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,918
Yeah, you don't remember?

267
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,348
No, I just don't know.

268
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,715
Because I think I'm probably the third one.

269
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,209
Ayanami

270
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,824
These are tears?

271
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:27,459
This should be the first time I've seen them,

272
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,240
but I feel like this isn't the first time.

273
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,920
Am l crying?

274
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,309
Why am I crying?

275
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:39,438
That's right. The First Child will be
maintained in her current condition.

276
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,640
There is no need for new restrictions.

277
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:44,109
The same goes for the Second and the Third.

278
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,340
They only need to be watched.

279
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:49,824
But Chairman Kiel and the rest will raise
a fuss when they learn that Rei is alive.

280
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:54,186
I have offered something else
to Seele's old men.

281
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,417
We needn't worry.

282
00:15:57,123 --> 00:16:00,025
We would like for things to proceed smoothly.

283
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:04,563
We do not wish to subject you to
any more degradation and suffering.

284
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:07,132
I do not feel humiliated whatsoever.

285
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,234
A strong-willed woman.

286
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,870
I can understand why lkari
would want you by his side.

287
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:16,851
But the person who handed you to us
is none other than lkari.

288
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,512
He refused to hand over the pilot
of Unit 00 for questioning.

289
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:23,413
He sent you as a substitute, Dr. Akagi.

290
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,753
I was sent in place of Rei?

291
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,556
Sorry, but don't
bother me.
Working

292
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,569
This is a part of the truth that you wanted.

293
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:35,660
I devised thirty-six other ways
to send it to you,

294
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,295
but you probably won't get them.

295
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,106
The only definite one is this capsule.

296
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,967
This is everything I have to offer.

297
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,277
Do with it as you see fit.

298
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,880
The password is our very first
memory together.

299
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,727
Bye, take care.

300
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:54,864
The phone that won't ring,
I won't let it irritate me anymore.

301
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,867
Because I've accepted your feelings.

302
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,291
Are we certain we did the right thing
concerning Dr. Akagi?

303
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:09,027
She is different from Fuyutsuki.

304
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,262
Returning her is in our best interest.

305
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,531
She has rendered distinguishing service
to the Eva series.

306
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,666
She can be of some use to us right now.

307
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,970
Indeed, for the sake of mankind's future.

308
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:22,674
Eight Evangelions are already being prepared.

309
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:25,310
Which leaves four more.

310
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:30,311
The annihilation of New Tokyo-3 will be good
material upon which to advance our plans.

311
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,083
Hurry their completion.

312
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,044
That will be our promised day.

313
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,084
Yes, hello?

314
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,427
Just listen to me.

315
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,229
I've released the restraints placed on you.

316
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,131
You should be able to go outside now.

317
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,212
Miss Ritsuko?

318
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,078
It's no use, not without my pass.

319
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,916
I see. It's Kaji's handiwork, isn't it?

320
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,953
You're going to let me see the secret
in there with my own eyes.

321
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:10,094
Fine, but he's coming too.

322
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:14,176
Fine.

323
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,280
This looks just like Ayanami's room.

324
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,148
This IS Rei Ayanami's room.

325
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,150
This is where she was born and raised.

326
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:40,151
This place?

327
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,932
Yes, this is where she was born.

328
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:45,357
The water and light that form
Rei's subconscious

329
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:47,559
must have a strong impression of this place.

330
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,780
Dr. Akagi, this isn't what I came here to see.

331
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,347
I know, Misato.

332
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,303
Evas?!

333
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,771
The very first ones.

334
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,072
They are the failures.

335
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,623
They were scrapped ten years ago.

336
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,176
A graveyard for Evas...

337
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,145
It's just a garbage dump.

338
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,226
This is also where your mother disappeared.

339
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:13,462
You may not remember it, but I believe
you were also watching

340
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,320
the very moment your mother vanished.

341
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,051
Ritsuko!

342
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,204
So, this is the source of the dummy plugs?

343
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,617
I will show you the truth.

344
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:40,854
Rei Ayanami?

345
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,850
You're not saying the Evas' dummy plugs are...

346
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,787
That's right, the part that becomes
the core of the dummy system,

347
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,455
and this is the manufacturing plant for it.

348
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:51,790
This is?!

349
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,558
These are just dummies.

350
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,729
And nothing more than parts for Rei.

351
00:19:56,796 --> 00:20:00,432
Man found God and in their joy,
tried to make Him theirs.

352
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,233
That's why there was divine retribution.

353
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,169
That was fifteen years ago.

354
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,340
The God they found had also
disappeared by then.

355
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:10,069
But then, they tried to resurrect
God on their own.

356
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,444
The result was Adam.

357
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:15,054
And imitating God, they created
people from Adam.

358
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,348
The result was the Evas.

359
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:20,318
People? They're human?

360
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,554
Yes, they're human.

361
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,255
The Evas do not intrinsically have souls,

362
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,096
but they have human souls embedded in them.

363
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,401
They were all salvaged.

364
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:31,845
The only vessel that contained a soul was Rei.

365
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,658
She was the only one born with a soul.

366
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:37,281
The Chamber of Gaf was empty, you see.

367
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:41,139
These things here that look like Rei
have no souls.

368
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,450
They're just vessels.

369
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:45,132
That's why I'm going to destroy them.
Because I hate them.

370
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:56,062
Do you know just what you're doing?!

371
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:00,297
Yes, I know. I'm destroying them.

372
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,669
They're not people.
They're things shaped like people.

373
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:07,837
But I lost, even to these things! I couldn't win!

374
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,769
I only needed to think of him,

375
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,080
and I could endure any kind of humiliation!

376
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,708
I didn't care what happened to my body!

377
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:19,477
But he... He...

378
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,013
And I knew too.

379
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,628
I'm a fooll

380
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,964
Like mother, like daughter,
we're both big fools!

381
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,690
If you want to kill me, do it.

382
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,572
No, I would be happy if you would do it.

383
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,112
That would be truly foolish of you.

384
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:51,658
The tragedy of the people
possessed by the Evas...

385
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,716
But that goes for me too.

386
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,767
To Be Continued

387

Preview

388
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:09,087
The city disappears, his friends leave.

389
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:11,489
A boy smiles upon the timid Shinji.

390
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,826
Shinji gives himself over to the smile
that is like a soothing breeze.

391
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:18,229
But a cruel fate was in store for them.

392
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,163
