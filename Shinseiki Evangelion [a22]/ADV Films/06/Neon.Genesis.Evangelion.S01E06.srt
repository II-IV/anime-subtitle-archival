1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:06,301
Just like the cruel angel

2
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:14,167
Young boy, become a legend

3
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:28,156
Even though the untested breeze
taps at the door to your heart

4
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:36,580
You just look solely at me and smile

5
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:42,938
So intent on seeking out that gentle touch

6
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:51,065
Such innocent eyes, still ignorant
of their destiny

7
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:58,089
But someday, you are sure to realize
that upon your back

8
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:06,007
You have the wings with which to fly
towards the distant future

9
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:11,202
The cruel angel's thesis

10
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:14,940
Soon, you will take flight from the windowsill

11
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:18,711
With your torrent of ardent pathos

12
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:22,414
If you are to betray our memories

13
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:26,051
You, who embrace these heavens and shine

14
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:29,333
Young boy, become a legend

15
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,994
We're detecting a high energy reaction
from inside the target!

16
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:36,896
What?!

17
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:39,298
The circumference area is accelerating!
It's converging!

18
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,589
It can't bel

19
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,140
No, dodge it!

20
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,146
Retrieve him, hurry!

21
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,725
The target has gone silent!

22
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:06,826
How's Shinji?

23
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:07,660
He's alive!

24
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:11,030
Unit 01 has been recovered.
En route to the 7th cage.

25
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,781
I'm going to the cage.
Take over for me, please!

26
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:16,902
Unit 01 secured!

27
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:17,436
Hurry with the cooling!
Unit 01 secured!

28
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:17,927
Hurry with the cooling!

29
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,674
The pilot's brain waves are erratic!

30
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,075
His pulse is very weak.

31
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:26,478
Increase life support to maximum power.
Give him a heart massage.

32
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,329
Yes, Ma'am!

33
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,548
Pulse confirmed!

34
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,539
Force eject the entry plug! Hurry!

35
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,156
Emergency LCL discharge!

36
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,027
Yes, Ma'am!

37
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:40,729
Come on, open the hatch! Hurry!

38
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,374
Shinji!

00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:20,524
Decisive Battle,

11 Scale Balloon Dummy

41
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:37,083
The enemy's particle beam cannon has hit!

42
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,617
The dummy has been vaporized!

43
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:39,958
Next.

00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,912
Automated Model 12 Seli-Propelled Mortar

45
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,070
The Model 12 Self-Propelled Mortar
has been destroyed!

46
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,620
I see.

47
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:03,007
From the data we've collected,
we're assuming that the target

48
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,911
automatically attacks any opponent
within a certain range.

The likelihood of it hitting anything entering
the area with its particle beam is 100%.

51
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,850
The likelihood of it hitting anything entering
the area with its particle beam is 100%.

52
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:14,453
It's too risky for close range combat
in an Eva, isn't it?

53
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:15,787
What about its AT field?

54
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:16,122
Replay Image
What about its AT field?

55
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:17,156
Replay Image
It's still active.

56
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:21,393
Replay Image
It's strong enough that the spatial changes
in phase are visible to the naked eye.

58
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:26,465
Using half-measures like guided missiles,
artillery, or bombs

59
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,768
will inflict more damage on us
than on the Angel!

60
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:33,572
Offensively and defensively it's
almost perfect. A flying fortress.

61
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,775
What's the status on its drill?

62
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,010
At this moment the target
is directly above us,

63
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,946
penetrating the New Tokyo-3 Null Zone.

64
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,883
A giant shielded drill with
a diameter of 17.5 meters

65
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,314
is boring towards Nerv HQ.

66
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:52,391
The enemy is planning to attack Nerv
Headquarters directly.

67
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,293
Sassy bastard!

68
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,462
So, what's its ETA?

69
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:56,662
Japan Standard Time
Remaining Estimated Time
So, what's its ETA?

70
00:04:56,663 --> 00:05:00,366
Japan Standard Time
Remaining Estimated Time
12:06:54 AM.

71
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:00,599
Approximated graphics
12:06:54 AM.

72
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,303
Approximated graphics
By that time, it will have breached
all twenty-two levels of armor,

73
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,639
Approximated graphics
and arrive at Nerv Headquarters itself.

74
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,190

75
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,858
Less than ten hours...

00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:15,548
Present Time

77
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:18,017
Present Time
The drill has contacted the first armor plate.

78
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:18,450
The drill has contacted the first armor plate.

79
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,853
What's the condition of Unit 01?

80
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:21,086
Cage 7, Nerv Headquarters
What's the condition of Unit 01?

81
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,823
Cage 7, Nerv Headquarters
The defensive armor was melted
down to the third layer.

82
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:24,890
The defensive armor was melted
down to the third layer.

83
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:29,028
The silver lining is that the central
control unit sustained no damage.

84
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:32,431
Three more seconds, and
it would have been over.

85
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:36,101
In three hours, the replacement parts
should be installed.

86
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,469
Roger.

87
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,737
What's the status of Unit 00?

88
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,207
Re-activation itself should
prove no problem,

89
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,843
but there's still a feedback error.

90
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:44,910
So actual combat...

91
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:47,079
...is still impossible.

92
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,048
What's the condition of Unit 01's pilot?

93
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:49,748

What's the condition of Unit 01's pilot?

94
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,517

No physical damage.

However, his nerve pulses are up by 0.8.

96
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,653
However, his nerve pulses are up by 0.8.

97
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,989
Still within acceptable limits.

98
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,126
Enemy drill arrival: 9 hours, 55 minutes.

99
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,395
The situation certainly isn't favorable.

100
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,564
Shall we just raise a white flag?

101
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,765
Before we resort to that,

102
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,906
there's one little thing I'd like to try.

103
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:14,473
You want a sniper to shoot the target
from outside its firing zone?

104
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:14,840
Nerv Commander’s Office
You want a sniper to shoot the target
from outside its firing zone?

105
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:15,774
Nerv Commander’s Office
Yes, Sir.

106
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,943
Nerv Commander’s Office
Instead of trying to neutralize
the target's AT field,

107
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:18,177
Instead of trying to neutralize
the target's AT field,

108
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:21,914
I believe a pinpoint shot with a
high-energy beam is the only way.

109
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,449
What do the Magi say?

110
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,885
The responses from the Magi
Super Computers

111
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:29,355
were two affirmative and
one conditional affirmative.

112
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:32,424
So, our probability of success is 8.7 percent.

113
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,793
It's quite a high percentage.

114
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:39,531
I see no reason to raise an objection.
You may proceed, Captain Katsuragi.

115
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,267
Yes, Sir.

116
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:44,436
But you sure have come up with
a reckless plan,

117
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,238
Operations Director Katsuragi.

118
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,607
Don't be rude. It's not reckless!

119
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,976
It can be executed within the
nine hours we have left,

120
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,312
and has the highest chance of success.

121
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:54,573
This thing does? Really?

But our positron rifle can't handle
such a high output.

124
00:06:59,085 --> 00:06:59,818
But our positron rifle can't handle
such a high output.

125
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:00,886
What are you going to do about that?

126
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,656
We'll borrow one, of course.

127
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:06,147
Borrow one? You don't mean...

128
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,762
Right! The Strategic SDF Lab's prototype!

to its original condition as we can.

00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,579
We'll try to return this in as close
to its original condition as we can.

137
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,950
We appreciate your cooperation!

138
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,201
Okay, Rei! Take it away!

139
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,140
That's a piece of precision machinery,
so be careful!

140
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:46,565
Even so, our calculations
show that it will take

141
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,368
at least 180 million kilowatts to
penetrate that AT field.

142
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:52,089

that much electricity?

The drill has just broken through
the seventh defensive layer.

172
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,275

3.2% behind schedule, but we should
manage to be finished by 23:10.

176
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,000

we'll have it built for you in three hours.

181
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:49,194
What about our defensive measures?

Well, using a shield is about all we can do.

184

So, this is the shield?

187
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,035
Eva Anti-Heat and Light Wave Defensive
Equipment (Makeshift Specs)
Yes. It's a hand-me-down from
a single stage to orbit rocket.

188
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,370
Yes. It's a hand-me-down from
a single stage to orbit rocket.

189
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:03,371
It may look ugly, but it's got a super-
electromagnetic base coating that

190
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:06,812
Section 2 guarantees will stand up to
the enemy's particle beam

191
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,280
for at least seventeen seconds.

192
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:11,083
Good. Have you determined
the sniper position?

193
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,218
Given the range to the target,
geographical features,

194
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,922
and taking power access into consideration,
this would be the spot.

195
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:20,059
Definitely looks good.

196
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,561
The sniping position will be atop Mt. Futago!

197
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,697
The operation will commence
at 00:00 tomorrow morning!

198
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,801
From this point on, this operation will be
called "Operation Yashima".

Roger.

200
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,986
Now, the only remaining problem
is the pilot.

201
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:46,652
Unit 01's designated pilot is conscious now.

204
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,056
His examination results look normal.

205
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:55,060
Good. Then, the operation will
proceed as planned.

206
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,228
Roger.

207
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,099
But I wonder if he'll pilot it again.

208
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,133
Get ready for a decisive battle at Mt. Futago!

211
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,455
I'm here to brief you on the timetable
of Operation Yashima,

212
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,706
which will begin tomorrow at 00:00 hours.

213
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:32,727
Pilots Ikari and Ayanami will arrive
at the cage at 17:30 today.

214
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:37,936
At 18:00, Units 01 and 00 will activate.

215
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,272
Launch is at 18:05.

216
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:43,542
They will arrive at the temporary base
on Mt. Futago at 18:30.

217
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:46,245
There, they will stand by and
await further orders.

218
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:49,436
The operation will begin
promptly at midnight.

219
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,931
Here's a new one.

220
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,872
Don't show up half-asleep looking like that.

221
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,125
Sorry.

222
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,853
All I've been doing since
yesterday is apologizing.

223
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,267
Your meal.

224
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,852
I don't want to eat anything.

225
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,488
We'll be departing in sixty minutes.

226
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:33,058
Do I have to pilot that thing again?

227
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,259
Yes, you do.

228
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,063
I don't want to.

229
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,598
Maybe you can be so cool about it,

230
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:42,029
because you haven't had the kind
of experiences I've had yet.

231
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,371
I don't want to go through that again.

232
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,301
Then why don't you stay in bed?

233
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:49,828
Stay in bed?

234
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,847
I'll pilot Unit 01.

235
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:59,380
Dr. Akagi is already prepared to rewrite
Unit 01's personal data files.

236
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,520
Miss Ritsuko is...

237
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:05,091
I'm leaving. Captain Katsuragi and
Dr. Akagi will be waiting at the cage.

238
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:10,779
Goodbye.

240
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:33,385
They're awfully late. We oughta
evacuate to the shelter.

241
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:36,021
I hacked into my dad's data files.

242
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:38,156
I'm sure this is the time.

243
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,997
Yeah, but they still ain't here.

244
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,766
The mountain is moving.

245
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,057
The Evangelions!

246
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,812
Cool!

247
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:07,433
Go for it! We're counting on you!
Evangelion! Good luck!

248
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,421

00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,828
Near Asahi Falls on Mt. Futago
The drill has penetrated through
the 17th layer of armor.

251
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:17,029
Near Asahi Falls on Mt. Futago
It will reach headquarters in
3 hours 55 minutes.

252
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,865
It will reach headquarters in
3 hours 55 minutes.

253
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,900
No problem with the hub
synchronization system.

254
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:25,070
Power supply transfer from Shikoku
and Kyushu is completed.

255
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,441
Begin tests of each cooling system.

256
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,011
This is a piece of precision machinery,
so handle it carefully.

Will it really work?

259
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:38,984
Eva Positron Sniper Rifle
(Nerv Specs - Formerly Strategic SDF Lab's

There's no choice.
This is a makeshift solution.

260
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,686
There's no choice.
This is a makeshift solution.

261
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:42,187
So it'll be okay?

262
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,722
Theoretically, yes.

263
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:48,527
However, we won't know if the cannon barrel
and accelerator will hold until we try firing it.

264
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:51,188
This is the first time it's been fired
with such a high power output.

265
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:57,202
Here are your individual duties
for the operation.

266
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:57,836
Shinji...

267
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:58,737
Yes, Ma'am.
Shinji...

268
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,572
Your Unit 01 will be the gunner.

269
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:01,640
Yes, Ma'am.

270
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:04,176
Rei, you're in charge of defense with Unit 00.

271
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,177
Yes, Ma'am.

272
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:09,448
This is because Shinji has a higher
sync ratio with Unit 01,

273
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:13,118
and this operation will require
exceptional precision.

274
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,953
Since the positron beam will be
influenced by the Earth's gravity,

275
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:18,657
magnetic fields and rotation,
it will not fire in a straight line.

276
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:21,893
You must remember to make
adjustments for these deviations.

277
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,963
You must penetrate the core precisely.

278
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:28,967
But I've never practiced this!

279
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,369
Don't worry.

280
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,404
Just do what the manual says.

281
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:36,441
When the indicators converge
in the center, pull the trigger.

282
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,944
The computers will handle the rest.

283
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:40,946
Also, once you fire it,

284
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:43,181
it will take time before you can fire again

285
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:46,151
for cooling, reloading,
and replacement of the fuses.

286
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:49,321
Then, if I miss and the enemy shoots back...

287
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,556
Don't think about unnecessary
things right now.

288
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,837
Just think about destroying it in one shot.

289
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,897
So it's crisis time.

290
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,133
l...

291
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,502
I just need to defend Unit 01, correct?

292
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,070
That's right.

293
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,838
Understood.

294
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,941
It's time. Both of you, get changed.

295
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,232
Yes, Ma'am.

296
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:24,107
We might die doing this.

297
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,415
Why do you say that?

298
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,264
You won't die.

299
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:36,658
Because I'll protect you.

300
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:44,329
...a large-scale power outage all across...

301
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,827
Why do you pilot this thing?

302
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,685
Because I'm bound.

303
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:27,386
Bound?

304
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,735
Yes, it's a bond.

305
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,593
With my father?

306
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:35,584
With all people.

307
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:40,599
You're very strong, Ayanami.

308
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,569
Because I have nothing else.

309
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,180
What do you mean, "you have nothing else"?

310
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,457
It's time. Let's go.

311
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:53,982
Goodbye.

312
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,927

Shinji, we're entrusting you with
all the electricity of Japan.

319
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:22,807
Good luck.

320
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:23,909
Yes, Ma'am!
