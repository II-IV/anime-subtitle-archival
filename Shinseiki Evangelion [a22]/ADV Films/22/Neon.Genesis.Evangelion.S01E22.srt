15
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:34,092
The hypothetical became reality.

16
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,797
Talk about unlucky, the proponent
becoming the test subject herself.

17
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:41,467
Then, that contact experiment
was the direct cause?

18
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:44,536
Mental breakdown, that was
the result of the contact.

19
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:48,407
But how cruel is it to commit suicide,
leaving such a young daughter behind?

20
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:51,658
No, there might actually be
more to this than that.

21
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:58,351
Asuka, dear, your mom cooked
your favorite dish today.

22
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:02,854
Come on, if you're picky about your food,
that big girl over there is going to laugh at you.

23
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,923
She goes on like that every day.

24
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:07,493
She talks to the doll, thinking it's her daughter.

25
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,429
She probably feels responsible in her own way.

26
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,600
Her research filled her days and she had no time
to pay attention to our daughter.

27
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,869
You have my sympathies.

28
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,638
But the way she is, they're
practically a family of dolls.

29
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,980
No, perhaps humans and dolls
are not so different.

30
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:27,997
Humans made dolls in their own image.

31
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:33,986
If God exists, we may be nothing more
than dolls to Him.

32
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,007
I'm surprised to hear such words from
a practitioner of modern medicine.

33
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,847
I’m just another human before I’'m a doctor,
a flesh and blood woman.

34
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,677
You're such a good girl, Asuka.

35
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,545
It's okay, you don't have to hold it in, you know?

36
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,976
It's okay. I'm not going to cry.
1'm going to think for myself.

37
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:06,952
Can you hear me, Asuka?

38
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,654
Your synch rate is down by eight points.

39
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,656
As always, keep your mind off other things.

40
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:11,557
I'm doing it!

41
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,078
At Least, Be Human
Episode Twenty-Two

42
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:19,398
Asuka's synch rate has been
on a downward trend lately.

43
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,368
It's problematic, considering our tight situation.

44
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,737
Let's make Rei's Unit 00 our priority.

45
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:27,318
Right now, we don't have the leeway
to repair both at the same time.

46
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:34,146
Mitosis in Unit 02's left arm has
cleared the target value.

47
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,837
Necrosis is currently under
point zero five percent.

48
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:40,219
The apoptosis process is operating normally.

49
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,589
Unit 00's morphogenetic system
is currently stable.

50
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,280
Please connect receptors to Signal 2.

51
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,956
The Eva series, born from Adam.

52
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,902
We even have to make use of what
caused the Second Impact

53
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,971
in order for us to win against the Angels.

54
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,040
Put it another way, in order to live,

55
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,310
we will even use the thing
that tried to wipe us out.

56
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,921
I guess that's what humans do.

57
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,136
In the end, maybe I do hate the Eva.

58
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,386
My father's murderer...

59
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,114
Miss Katsuragi!

60
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:17,189
Construction of Evas up through
Unit 13 has begun?

61
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,958
In seven different locations around the world?

62
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,693
This information came via Shanghai.

63
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:22,561
The source can be trusted.

64
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,030
Why are they rushing mass production
at this stage?

65
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:29,101
We've lost two Evas in the past and
two are currently heavily damaged.

66
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,070
Perhaps they're rushing
to reinforce our reserves

67
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,605
with an eye towards the
secondary preparations.

68
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,206
I don't know.

69
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,709
Even here, we're getting Germany
to give us parts

70
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,729
from Unit 05 and 06 that are
being built there.

71
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,214
There seems to be a lot of money
changing hands lately.

72
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,817
Our budget was doubled since
we came here after all.

73
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,953
Do you suppose that just shows
how desperate the higher-ups are?

74
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,414
I sense a certain impatience on
the part of the Committee.

75
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,959
Then are they anticipating a case
where not single,

76
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,530
but multiple Angels are deployed
against us at once?

77
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:01,721
Maybe, but there's no reason to do it unofficially.

78
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,579
They must have some other objective in mind.

79
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,962
All three of us are here for once
and we're just so awkward.

80
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:33,372
I'm done.

81
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:36,468
Asuka!

82
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,605
No way! It's just going to be
another call from Kaji for you!

83
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,036
You answer it!

84
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,078
That's not likely.

85
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,885
Oh, my, the great invincible Shiniji,
lowering himself to such a menial chore.

86
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,854
Thank you so very much.

87
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,145
Yes, hello?

88
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,056
What's with his prissy attitude?

89
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,663
An international call from Germany for you.

90
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:05,965
It's your mother.

91
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,716
For me? From Mom?

92
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,027
Give it here!

93
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,777
When she's talking in a language
I don't understand,

94
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,678
it's like she becomes a total stranger.

95
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,563
A mother?

96
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,308
You sure talked for a long time.

97
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:52,344
Well, it's our usual bit of communication.

98
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,446
It must be nice to have a family to talk to.

99
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:57,027
Well, just in appearance. It's only on the surface.

100
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,341
She's not my real mother anyway.

101
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,855
But it's not like I hate her.

102
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,526
I just don't deal with her well.

103
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:08,093
Why the hell am [ telling you all this?!

104
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,495
Sorry.

105
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:12,806
It's all over if even you start
sympathizing with me!

106
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,572
She's at negative twelve point eight
on the synch index,

107
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,374
just barely above the activation level.

108
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,043
That's terrible.

109
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,683
She's dropped off even more than yesterday.

110
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,481
Asuka isn't feeling well today.
She's on her second day.

111
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:32,552
The synch rate isn't affected by
superficial physical conditions.

112
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,626
The problem lies more in the subconscious.

113
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,892
We may have no choice but to
change the core of Unit 02.

114
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,563
Asuka, you can come up.

115
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,831
Repair work on Power Grid 8 is scheduled
to begin at 1800 today.

116
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:47,866
Asuka's pride is in pieces.
Repair work on Power Grid 8 is scheduled
to begin at 1800 today.

117
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:48,100
Asuka's pride is in pieces.

118
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:51,437
The regular meeting concerning
the disposal issue
It's not surprising, considering how she lost.

119
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,572
of Command Center 1 will be
held on schedule.
Or rather, the fact she thinks she
lost to Shinji looms larger.

120
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,107
General Affairs managers, please come
to Conference Room 2.
Or rather, the fact she thinks she
lost to Shinji looms larger.

121
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:56,041
General Affairs managers, please come
to Conference Room 2.

122
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,042
General Affairs managers, please come
to Conference Room 2.
Maybe the three of us living together
has reached the limit.

123
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,153
Maybe the three of us living together
has reached the limit.

124
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,613
Threshold exceeded?

125
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,453
Is this the end of your merry game of house?

126
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,929
I don't want to hear that from someone
who keeps a cat to keep loneliness at bay.

127
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,450
I'm sorry, I guess I'm on edge.

128
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:18,718
Why do I have to go through this just
because I'm a woman?!

129
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,793
I don't even want kids!

130
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:26,638
Route Loop 7 is currently closed
due to an accident.

131
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,329
Please use the detour via Route 12.

132
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,504
The Eva won't move unless you open your heart.

133
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,135
Are you saying that my heart is closed?!

134
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,343
Yes, the Evas have souls.

135
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,634
Those puppets?!

136
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,047
You should know that.

137
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,882
Fancy you starting up a conversation!

138
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,663
Maybe it'll snow tomorrow!

139
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,956
What?! Are you so happy that
I can't pilot my Eva?!

140
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,292
There's nothing to worry about!
If another Angel attacks us,

141
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:56,595
the great, invincible Shinji will
take care of it for us!

142
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,797
We don't have to do anything!

143
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,848
All they need is Shinijil

144
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:06,738
First, I get Shinji's sympathy, and now,
even from the mechanical puppet girl.

145
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,849
I've really lost my edge.

146
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:10,943
I am not a puppet.

147
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,779
Shut up! You do whatever you're told!

148
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,815
You'd die if Commander lkari
told you to, wouldn't you?!

149
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,016
That's right.

150
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,921
You really ARE a puppet!

151
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,912
I've always really hated you because
you're so much like a puppet!

152
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,247
Everyone! I hate everyonel!

153
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,859
Shinji didn't show up today either.

154
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,381
Though Ayanami's absence is normal.

155
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,983
Asuka didn't come either.

156
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,154
And Suzuhara's still in the hospital.

157
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,622
I guess school isn't much of a priority right now.

158
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:59,258
Signal from Eva Unit 02 showing no problems.

159
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,426
VA connection and fusion are normal.

160
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,207
Rate of proliferation is within expected limits.

161
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:08,857
You're my puppet, so all you have to do
is quietly do as I say!

162
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,871
Why does a weapon need a soul anyway?!

163
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,332
It only gets in the way!

164
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:18,088
Anyway, all you have to do is obey my orders.

165
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,157
This is so stupid.

166
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:27,786
All hands, battle stations, level one!

167
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,555
Prepare for anti-air combat!

168
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:30,786
An Angel?! They're still coming?!

169
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,306
Angel, visually confirmed.

170
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,733
Here is the highest magpnification.

171
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,169
It isn't budging from its satellite orbit.

172
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,772
It's maintaining a set distance from our location.

173
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:50,209
Which means, it's waiting for a chance
to descend and close in,

174
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,911
or it can attack us without the need to do so.

175
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,947
We can't make a careless move at this rate.

176
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:59,138
Either way, we can't do anything about it
unless the target moves within our firing range.

177
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,973
The Eva units aren't capable of
attacking anything in orbit.

178
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:05,257
How's Rei?

179
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,759
She's in good shape, along with Unit 00.
She's ready to go.

180
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,860
Roger that.

181
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,229
Launch Unit 00!

182
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,600
Prepare for extreme long range firing.

183
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:15,267
Unit 02 and Asuka will stand by
for launch as backup!

184
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:18,237
Backup?! Me?! To Unit 00?!

185
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,205
That's right, take the rear position.

186
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,956
You have got to be joking!
Eva Unit 02, taking off!

187
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:26,248
Asuka!

188
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,382
That's fine, we'll let her take the lead.

189
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:31,493
Major Katsuragi!

190
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,721
Meaning, this is the end for Asuka
if she can't perform now.

191
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:37,122
Her last chance, then?

192
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:41,360
We'll have to think about
a replacement pilot for Unit 02.

193
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:42,194
Yes, Ma'am.

194
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,065
Aren't we sending out Unit 01?

195
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,744
It's been put on suspension under
Commander Ikari's strict orders.

196
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,903
I suppose it's not surprising
after what happened.

197
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,104
Inspection
Division

198
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:16,928
If I mess this up, they'll probably
take me off Unit 02.

199
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,919
No mistakes allowed, Asuka.

200
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,311
Target is still outside firing range.

201
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:35,352
Oh, hurry up and get over here already!
Talk about irritating!

202
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,795
Warning

203
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,323
Is it a direct energy weapon?!

204
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,091
No, I'm not getting any thermal energy readings.

205
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,659
Her psychograph readings are agitated!

206
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,120
Mental contamination beginning!

207
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:51,596
The Angel is launching a psychological attack?

208
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,146
They can comprehend the mind
of a human being?

209
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,149
Goddamn it!

210
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:04,976
Positrons have dissipated!

211
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,877
No good! It's outside the firing range!

212
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,191
Unit 02, out of rifle ammunition!

213
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,592
Analysis of the ray of light?!

214
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,427
It's an energy wave within the visible spectrum!

215
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:25,364
It's similar to the AT Field,
but details are unknown!

216
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,131
What about Asuka?

217
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:28,651
She's in danger! The mental
contamination has entered Y!

218
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,149
No!

219
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,137
Don't... Don't come inside me!

220
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:38,598
It hurts

221
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:39,875
It hurts!

222
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:44,771
Don't come in!

223
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:46,127
It hurts!

224
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:49,776
Stop it

225
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:54,714
Don't come inside

226
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:58,351
No!

227
00:14:58,498 --> 00:14:59,488
No!

228
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:01,900
It hurts

229
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:02,751
No!

230
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:05,057
Mother

231
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,228
No!

232
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:10,041
Don't look inside my mind!

233
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:13,011
Please! Don't dig deeper into my heart!

234
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:13,779
Asuka!

235
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,514
Her psychograph readings are at their limit!

236
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,716
Her mental circuits are being torn to shreds.

237
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,651
It'll be too dangerous if they're
overloaded any more.

238
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:20,852
Asuka, come back!

239
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,020
No!

240
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,755
That's an order! Asuka, retreat!

241
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,557
No! Never!

242
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:28,326
I'd rather die here than go back now!

243
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,197
Asuka!

244
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,363
Accelerator being aligned.

245
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:33,532
Voltage increasing, approaching pressurization.

246
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,133
Forced convergence, activated.

247
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:38,203
Adjusting zero point zero three
for Earth's rotation and gravity.

248
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:40,372
Superconductive guidance system in operation.

249
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,107
Chamber at maximum pressure.

250
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,542
Final safety released!

251
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:44,476
Release confirmed.

252
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:45,737
Everything in launch position!

253
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:56,588
It's no good! The power level is far too low
to penetrate the AT Field at this range!

254
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:59,958
But output is at maximum! Anything more is...

255
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,394
Unit 02, psychograph readings
are growing weaker!

256
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,162
What about the LCL's psychological barrier?!

257
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,665
It's no use. It's not even working as a catalyst!

258
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,868
Prioritize life support. Shut out
the feedback from the Eva.

259
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:10,719
Yes, Ma'am.

260
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:14,688
It's as if this light is probing Asuka's
psychological wavelength.

261
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,465
Could it be that the Angel is trying
to learn about the human mind?!

262
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:29,537
Why am I crying?

263
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,589
I already decided I wouldn't cry anymore.

264
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,963
What's the matter, Asuka?

265
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:41,154
It's a present from your new mom.
Don't you like it?

266
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,324
It's okay.

267
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:45,136
What's okay?

268
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,805
I'm not a child!

269
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,340
1'm going to grow up quickly.

270
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,331
I don't need stuffed animals.

271
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,244
So look at mel

272
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,735
Mom! Please, don't quit being my mom!

273
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,515
Die with me.

274
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,706
Mom! Mom! Please don't kill me!

275
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,787
No! I'm not your doll!

276
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,257
I'm going to think and live for myself!

277
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,959
I don't need a mom or a dad.
1'm going to live on my own.

278
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,095
No, don't make me remember this!

279
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:12,831
I'd forgotten about it! Don't dig it up again!

280
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:15,233
I don't need any of this bad stuff anymore!

281
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:17,753
Stop it already! Stop it!

282
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,907
My mind's been defiled.

283
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:28,538
Mr. Kaji, I've been defiled.

284
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:32,649
What will I do? I've been defiled.

285
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,058
Unit 02 has shut down!

286
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,960
Life support has developed a problem.

287
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:43,481
Pilot entering a dangerous state!

288
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,597
No change in target.

289
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,632
Relative distance has remained the same.

290
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:52,304
Probability of it moving within firing range
of Unit 00 is point zero two percent.

291
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:55,707
Should we transport Unit 00 into the air
and snipe it from there?

292
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:56,975
No, that won't work.

293
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:58,977
It'll all be over if we get shot down
on the approach.

294
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:00,268
I'll go out there in Unit 01!

295
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:04,643
No! The target corrodes the pilot's psyche.

296
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,855
Right now, we must avoid
the corrosion of Unit 01.

297
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:12,023
Then I just have to keep from getting hit, right?!

298
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,325
Your success is not guaranteed.

299
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,594
But at this rate, Asuka will...

300
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,897
I don't care. Rei, go down into Dogma
and use the Lance.

301
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:20,565
The Lance of Longinus?!

302
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:21,676
Ikari, that is...

303
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:26,081
We cannot reach the target's AT Field in orbit,
and that's the only way to bring it down.

304
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,273
Hurry!

305
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:32,844
But contact between an Eva and Adam
might cause the Third Impact!

306
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,179
It's far too dangerous!

307
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,760
Commander lkari, please don't do this!

308
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,588
A lie, so it was a deception.

309
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,129
Contact with an Angel was not the cause
of the Second Impact then.

310
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,760
Central Dogma, levels ten to fifteen
have been unlocked.

311
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,741
Unit 00 has passed through
the sixth trench of the Malebolge.

312
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,325
Levels sixteen to twenty
have now been unlocked.

313
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,941
So the Third Impact won't happen.
At least, not because of this.

314
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,632
Then what caused the Second Impact?

315
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,387
Ikari, are we not getting ahead of ourselves?

316
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:17,937
The Committee has already started
mass-producing the Eva series.

317
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,458
This is our chance, Fuyutsuki.

318
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,227
But this is...

319
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:24,098
We cannot turn back time,

320
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,884
but we do have the power to spur it onward.

321
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,574
The old men will not stand for this!

322
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,050
We must finish everything before
Seele begins to act.

323
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:43,214
It would be unwise for us
to lose Unit 02 right now.

324
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:47,254
That may be, but using the Lance of Longinus
without Seele's permission will be troublesome.

325
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:52,323
A reason need only exist.
Anything beyond that is insignificant.

326
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,454
A reason? What you're looking for
is an excuse, isn't it?

327
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:59,164
Brain waves of Unit 02 pilot have
dropped to zero point zero six!

328
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,132
Life support reaching a critical point!

329
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,243
Unit 00 has passed through Number 2,
emerging on surface.

330
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,212
So, that's the Lance of Longinus.

331
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,181
Unit 00, prepared to throw.

332
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:18,316
Target confirmed. Adjustment for errors made.

333
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:19,851
Beginning countdown.

334
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:20,962
T-minus ten seconds.

335
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:22,921
Eight...

336
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,155
Seven...

337
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,290
Six...

338
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,524
Five...

339
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:27,759
Four...

340
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,927
Three...

341
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:29,928
Two...

342
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:30,895
One...

343
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:31,886
Zerol

344
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:46,978
Target has been destroyed.

345
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,047
Eva Unit 02 disengaged.

346
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:50,749
What about the Lance of Longinus?

347
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,484
It broke the first astronautical velocity.

348
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,215
It is currently moving into lunar orbit.

349
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,955
Recovering it will be nearly impossible.

350
00:20:56,956 --> 00:21:00,525
Yes, at present, we do not have the means
to bring back that much mass.

351
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:12,504
Unit 02 is in good condition.
Readings currently at normal levels.

352
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:14,439
Bring the Eva back to Cage 2.

353
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,340
Please use Route 67.

354
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:18,877
What about Asuka?

355
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,979
Pilot's life signs confirmed.

356
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,410
Quarantine due to the contamination
has been removed.

357
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,483
I see.

358
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:34,305
Do Not Enter

359
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,567
I'm glad for you, Asuka.

360
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:45,303
Shut up! There's nothing to be glad about!

361
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,606
Of all the people, she had to be
the one to save mel

362
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,176
I had to be saved by HER!

363
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:53,897
I would've rather died than be saved by her!

364
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,682
I hate it! I hate it! I hate everyone!

365
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:58,583
I hate everyone so much!

366
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:00,894
To Be Continued

367
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:07,385
Preview

368
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,088
Eva Unit 00 is possessed
and violated by an Angel.

369
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:13,779
Rei chooses death of her own will in order
to protect Shinji from the Angel's corrosion.

370
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:18,796
She disappears along with New Tokyo-3,
turning into light and heat.

371
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:19,430
Next time: "Tears"

372
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:20,365
Next Time
Tears
Next time: "Tears"

373
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:21,596
Next Time
Tears
