Ordinary weapons prove
ineffective against the Angel

The operation is abandoned

Then,

32
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,265

Chief of Operations Captain Misato Katsuragi
the fact is that, against an unknown target,

36
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:55,107
the fact is that, against an unknown target,

37
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,375
And with the Third Angel and Unit 01
the fact is that, against an unknown target,

38
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:56,841
And with the Third Angel and Unit 01
a boy with zero experience went out on
his first battle and soundly defeated it.

39
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,311
a boy with zero experience went out on

The confirmation of an AT field
a boy with zero experience went out on
his first battle and soundly defeated it.

41
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:01,280
a boy with zero experience went out on
his first battle and soundly defeated it.

42
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:04,381
Shinji Ikari's achievement is
deserving of special notice.

43
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,258
Unit 01 erodes target’s AT field

44
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:12,224
However, for the Department of Operations,
it further highlighted areas of concern

45
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,185
and turned into a bitter battle, the execution
of which left much to be desired.

46
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,989
Angel Destroyed

47
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,254

all the time with my friends,

64
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,891

so by then it wasn't a big deal
or anything to worry about.

65
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:21,660
Hikari Horiki’s note (partial)
The guys were all acting up
like they were on a field trip,

72
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:10,193
Nerv obtains Angel sample
still in original shape

73
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:15,388

83
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,393
Nerv decisively executes
Operation Yashima

85
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,727

I think Unit 00 bravely interposed herself
to protect Unit 01

88
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,366

No, I'm certain of it.

89
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,703
Excerpt from Kensuke Aida’s personal materials
There's just one reason for that,
and that's Ayanami.

92
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:14,206
Because she seems to hold little respect

93
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,441
Operation Yashima executed successfully
Because she seems to hold little respect

94
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:15,822
Operation Yashima executed successfully

95
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:17,209
I think it's not quite pessimism, but
she already has something about her.

96
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,911
Eva Unit 00 heavily damaged
I think it's not quite pessimism, but
she already has something about her.

97
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,279
I think it's not quite pessimism, but

98
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,914
However, pilot returns safely
I think it's not quite pessimism, but

99
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:22,715
However, pilot returns safely
I find it hard to believe that she's
the same age as we are.

100
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,266
I find it hard to believe that she's
the same age as we are.

101
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,239
Sixth Angel

102
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,522
Encounter with Gaghiel

103
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:35,427
This incident deviated slightly from our script.

104
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:38,564
Nevertheless, the result was within
the projected parameters.

105
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,165
We can make the necessary adjustments.

106

Close quarters combat at sea

112
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:04,503
And

113
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,495
First underwater battle

114
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,839
In an engagement off the shore of Old ltoh

115
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:31,984
Angel Destroyed

116
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:37,352
The UN Navy lost a third of its
entire fleet in this encounter.

117
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:42,795
Those ships belonged to your country.
In reality, it's a trivial loss.

118
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,776
Indeed, it's quite fortunate that
the damage was so minor.

119
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,617
Seventh Angel

00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,807

First Angel to use dividing
and merging abilities

122
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:13,983
However, with the heavy simultaneous
2-point attack by Eva Unit 01 and Unit 02

123
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:26,965
Angel Destroyed

124
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,161
Eighth Angel

125
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,195
Sandalphon discovered
within Mt. Asama
crater

126
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,542
Nerv issues order A-17

127
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:45,291
Prioritized above all else, the first
capture operation is deployed

128
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,150
Confined briefly in the electromagnetic
optical wave enclosure,
but...

129
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:03,187
The electromagnetic membrane is torn to
shreds and the operation is interrupted

130
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,630
Operation objective is immediately
changed to destroying the Angel

131
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:16,593
Eva Unit 02 executes operation

132
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,358

133
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,936
Eva Unit-00 restored from damage
and modification work complete

134
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:29,488
Back on duty

135
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:30,903
Ninth Angel

136
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,044

Matarael Attacks

138
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:48,084

deployed at the same time

Against the target flying in
from the stratosphere

143
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,229
Through direct interception by the 3 Evas

144
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:41,766
Angel Destroyed

145
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,058
Eleventh Angel

146
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,949
Facts concerning the attack
are currently unconfirmed

147
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,478
Wild rumor of a direct invasion
of Nerv Headquarters

148
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,080
Wild rumor of a direct invasion
of Nerv Headquarters
This is no good.

149
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:48,401
Wild rumor of a direct invasion
of Nerv Headquarters

150
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:48,847
Human Instrumentality Committee
special meeting convened

151
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:49,915
Human Instrumentality Committee
special meeting convened
It's happening too early.

152
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:50,983
Human Instrumentality Committee
special meeting convened
Indeed!

153
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:55,287
An Angel invading Nerv HQ
was outside of our schedule.

154
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:58,824
And worse, to think that you let it
intrude into Central Dogma.

155
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,792
If contact had occurred then,

156
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,862
our entire project could have ended in disaster.

157
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,598
The report to this committee was in error.

158
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,334
No Angel invasion took place.

159
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:14,135
Ikari, are you then saying the Eleventh Angel's
intrusion did not occur?

160
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:16,508
Yes.

161
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,777
Speak with caution, lkari.

162
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,980
Making false statements to this conference
is punishable by death.

163
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:25,450
You are free to examine the Magi's recorders.

164
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,719
There is no evidence of any such incident.

165
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,424
This is absurd. Hiding the truth is your specialty.

166
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:36,662
The time schedule is advancing as described
in the Dead Sea Scrolls.

167
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,297
Fine then.

168
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:41,018
We'll leave aside the matter of crimes
or responsibility on your part.

169
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,679
But there is no need for you
to create a new script.

170
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,330
I realize that.

171
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,796
Everything is proceeding
according to Seele's script.

172
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,309
Chapter Fourteen
Seele, Throne of Souls

173
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,389
Mountain...

174
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,958
Heavy mountains.

175
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,829
Things that change over time.

176
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,697
Sky...

177
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:12,988
Blue sky.

178
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,190
What your eyes can't see.

179
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,562
What your eyes can see.

180
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:20,472
Sun...

181
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,902
A unique object.

182
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,909
Water...

183
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,844
Something comforting.

184
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,646
Commander Ikari?

185
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:28,814
Flowers...

186
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,882
So many of the same.

187
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,252
And so many unneeded.

188
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,686
Sky...

189
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,422
Red, red sky.

190
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,824
The color red.

191
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,892
I hate the color red.

192
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,194
Water flowing.

193
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,762
Blood...

194
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,997
The smell of blood.

195
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:47,232
A woman who never bleeds.

196
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,168
Man made from red soil.

197
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,569
Man made from man and woman.

198
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,942
City... A human creation.

199
00:12:56,943 --> 00:13:00,245
Eva... A human creation.

200
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:03,406
What is a human? A creation of God?

201
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,124
Is man a human creation?

202
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,721
The things I possess are life and soul.

203
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,390
I am a vessel for a soul.

204
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:14,320
Entry plug, the throne for a soul.

205
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:18,263
Who is this? This is me.

206
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:23,264
Who am 1? What am I? What am [?
What am I? What am I?

207
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,205
I am myself.

208
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,374
This object is me.

209
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,010
The form that shapes me.

210
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:36,415
This is the me that can be seen,
yet I feel as though I am not myself.

211
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,083
Very strange.

212
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:40,452
I feel as if my body is melting.

213
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:44,956
I can no longer see myself.
My shape is fading.

214
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,526
I feel the presence of someone who is not me.

215
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:50,247
Is someone there, beyond this?

216
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:52,531
Ikari?

217
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:55,334
I know this person. Major Katsuragi.

218
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,002
Doctor Akagi.

219
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,103
Everyone.

220
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,271
Classmates.

221
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,642
The pilot of Unit 02.

222
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,108
Commander Ikari?

223
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:04,376
Who are you?

224
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,877
Who are you?

225
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,188
Who are you?

226
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,885
So, Rei, how does it feel to be piloting
Unit 01 for the first time?

227
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,587
It smells like Ikari.

228
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:16,121
First unit interchangeability test
Subject Rei Ayanami
It smells like Ikari.

229
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:19,112
First unit interchangeability test
Subject Rei Ayanami

230
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,929
Her synch rate is almost the same
as with Unit 00.

231
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,999
Unit 00 and 01's personal data patterns
are very similar too, after all.

232
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,020
That's exactly what makes this
synchronization possible.

233
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:34,896
Error is plus or minus 0.03.
Harmonics are normal.

234
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:39,878
No interchangeability problems detected
between Rei and Unit 01.

235
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,546
Okay, the test is finished.

236
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,657
Rei, you can get out now.

237
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:45,774
Yes, Ma'am.

238
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:54,717
87th unit link-up test
Subject Asuka Langley Sohryu

239
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,963
Data bank for Unit 02 complete.

240
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:00,098
Harmonics are all normal.

241
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,000
Pilot status normal.

242
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,268
Of coursel!

243
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:03,502
First unit interchangeability test
Subject Shinji lkari
Of coursel!

244
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:06,972
First unit interchangeability test
Subject Shinji lkari

245
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:07,072
First unit interchangeability test
Subject Shinji lkari
Entry plug insertion complete.

246
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,840
Entry plug insertion complete.

247
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,143
What about Unit 00's personal data?

248
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:14,044
Already reconfigured. Currently reconfirming.

249
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:16,681
Subject status?

250
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,722
He appears a bit nervous, but no problems
in his nerve patterns.

251
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,788
This is his first time in Unit 00.

252
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,809
It's another Eva, so it's only natural.

253
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:29,488
He's so stupid. He should just take it easy
and not worry about those things.

254
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,498
Shinji's just not that kind of person.

255
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,369
I know, that's why he's stupid.

256
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,760
Speaking of which, don't I need to be involved
in their interchangeability test?

257
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,765
You don't want to pilot an Eva
besides Unit 02 anyway, do you?

258
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,759
Well, you've got that right.

259
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:53,039
Eva Unit 02 definitely
wouldn't be interchangeable.

260
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:56,288
Entry has commenced.

261
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,823
LCL electrolyzed.

262
00:15:57,824 --> 00:16:00,225
Initiating first connection.

263
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,836
Shinji, how do you feel in Unit 00's entry plug?

264
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,764
It feels kind of odd.

265
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,199
A sense of incongruity?

266
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,034
No, it's just that...

267
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:11,002
It smells like Ayanami.

268
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,839
What does he mean, smell? Is he a pervert?

269
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,541
Data received. Reconfirming. Pattern green.

270
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,310
Main power supply connection complete.

271
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,045
All restraints are normal.

272
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,379
Roger.

273
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,870
Now let's shift to the second stage
of the interchangeability tests.

274
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,597
Unit 00 will enter into second contact.

275
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,186
How is it?

276
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:28,920
As I thought, the synch rate is lower
than that of Unit 01.
How is it?

277
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,941
As I thought, the synch rate is lower
than that of Unit 01.

278
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,226
Harmonics are all normal.

279
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:35,516
But these are still good readings.

280
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,731
This means we can implement that plan.

281
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,399
The dummy system, you mean?

282
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,336
I know you support it, but I'm not so...

283
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,271
I understand why you wouldn't approve,

284
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:51,076
but we always need to be prepared
so that mankind can survive.

285
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:54,412
I highly respect you, Ma‘am,
and I will do my duty,

286
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,381
but I am not convinced about this project.

287
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,750
It's tough having a fastidious nature,

288
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,501
as far as living among people goes.

289
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,557
You'll understand that when
you feel that you've been sullied.

290
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:12,463
Initiating third connection.

291
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,867
Self psycho-graph is stable.

292
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:20,038
Hey, Shin, how do you like mommy's breast?
Or is it more like inside her womb?

293
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,908
Asuka, it'll introduce data noise. Don't interfere.

294
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:24,079
Okay, okay.

295
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:27,534
What's with them? They're all so quick
to mollycoddle Shiniji.

296
00:17:28,513 --> 00:17:30,715
Initiate A-10 nerve connection.

297
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,466
Harmonics level, plus twenty.

298
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,587
What is this?

299
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:39,398
Something's trying to get directly into my brain.

300
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,560
Ayanami?

301
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,363
Rei Ayanami?

302
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,414
This impression is Rei Ayanami, isn't it?

303
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:51,376
Ayanami?

304
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,378
Isn't it her?

305
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:58,410
What's going on?

306
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:58,810
We've got a problem occurring
in the pilot's nerve pulse.
What's going on?

307
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,312
We've got a problem occurring
in the pilot's nerve pulse.

308
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:01,212
Pulse reversing!

309
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,881
Mental contamination is taking place.

310
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:05,650
Impossible! That can't happen
at this plug depth.

311
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:06,818
It's not from the plug.

312
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,109
The intrusion's coming from the Eva.

313
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,609
Unit 00 is out of control!

314
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,851
Shut off all circuits! Cut the power supply!

315
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,477
Eva has switched to backup power.

316
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,346
Still operational.

317
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:35,213
How's Shinji?

318
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,515
The circuit's disconnected.
We can't monitor him!

319
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,751
Unit 00 is rejecting Shinji?

320
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:42,787
It's no good! The auto eject's not working!

321
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,156
The same thing as before...

322
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,797
Is it going to try to absorb Shiniji?

323
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,866
Rei, get back! Rei!

324
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,267
Rei, get back! Rei!
Activation will be terminated in ten...

325
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,503
Activation will be terminated in ten...

326
00:18:58,504 --> 00:18:59,404
9.

327
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:00,205
8...

328
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,039
7.

329
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,873
6...

330
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:02,674
5...

331
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:03,475
4.

332
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,209
3.

333
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:04,976
2.

334
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:05,777
1.

335
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:06,648
Zerol

336
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,574
Unit 00 has ceased activation.

337
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,957
Hurry up and rescue the pilot!

338
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,920
Could it be that Unit 00 just tried to kill Rei?

339
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,996
Was this somehow related to
the earlier berserk incident

340
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,337
when Rei was the pilot?

341
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,534
I can't tell you anything right now.

342
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:33,304
I only know we must reconfigure Unit 00
for Rei's personal data,

343
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,540
and run a new synch test between them
as soon as possible.

344
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:39,210
As Chief of Operations, I ask that you do so
as soon as possible,

345
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,346
before it impacts our work.

346
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,397
I know, Major Katsuragi.

347
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:56,437
The person Unit 00 wanted to hit was me.
I'm sure of it.

348
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:00,265
And now the next contestant

349
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:03,768
for the World's Most Amazing Exhibition is,
Math Puppy!

350
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:04,936
Wow, that sounds awesome!

351
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:08,873
Here we go, math genius puppy,
Kana, from Niigata!

352
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:09,541
Wan!

353
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,243
He sounds good. Do you understand me?

354
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:12,811
Wan!

355
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:17,248
Oh, right. Now let's ask him.

356
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,116
Wan!

357
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:21,953
What is 325 minus 324?

358
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:22,887
Wan!

359
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,256
That's amazing! He's correct!

360
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,277
I hate it. It's this ceiling again.

361
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:32,338
Shinji has regained consciousness.
No signs of mental contamination.

362
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,708
He doesn't appear to remember anything.

363
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:37,702
I see.

364
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:38,703
I see.
Hi! I'm doing fine,

365
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,138
Hi! I'm doing fine,

366
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:42,173
but the world is worrisome due to
terrorism in the Nansa Islands.

367
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,675
Misato and Mr. Kaji won't tell me,
but the world is worrisome due to
terrorism in the Nansa Islands.

368
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,477
Misato and Mr. Kaji won't tell me,
This year long heat creates some crazy
bastards, you know?

369
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:48,113
and Shinji doesn't even know.
This year long heat creates some crazy
bastards, you know?

370
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,114
and Shinji doesn't even know.
What I can't stand is those suicidal idiots
that involve innocent people!

371
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,845
Just what kind of girl is the First Child?
What I can't stand is those suicidal idiots
that involve innocent people!

372
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,752
The Angel invasion that deviated from the plan.

373
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:54,285
Knight
The Angel invasion that deviated from the plan.

374
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:54,753
The Angel invasion that deviated from the plan.

375
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:59,124
So the Human Instrumentality Committee is
taking advantage of having learned of it.

376
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:03,485
Though they're just worthless fools whose job
is to do nothing but complain.

377
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,830
We hold all the trump cards.
There is nothing they can do.

378
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:11,982
Still, that doesn't mean we should provoke them.

379
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:17,275
If Seele starts interfering now, it'll be trouble,
in more ways than one.

380
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,211
Everything is going according to our script.

381
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,213
There is no problem.

382
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:25,813
What about the Unit 00 accident?
That wasn't in my script.

383
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:27,922
It is no obstacle.

384
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:32,657
The re-synchronization test for Rei
and Unit 00 was successful.

385
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,997
Ikari is too concerned about Rei.

386
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:37,929
What is the status of the Adam Project?

387
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,665
Proceeding smoothly. It's not even
two percent behind schedule.

388
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,901
Then, the Lance of Longinus is...

389
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:44,235
It's going as planned.

390
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,786
Rei is carrying out the operation.

391
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,629
To Be Continued

392
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:07,274
Preview

393
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,321
With her friends getting married
one after another,

394
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,022
Misato alone begins to get worked up.

395
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:16,400
Could the reunion between her and Kaji
be her last chance?

396
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,130
Next episode: “Lies and Silence"

397
