Little Shin's Room

17
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:02,803
Shinji, wake up! How long are you going
to keep skipping school?

18
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:06,342
It's been five days now. Unit 01 has
already been completely repaired.

19
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:09,287
So don't you think the pilot needs
to get his act together too?

20
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:10,716
Shinji?!

21
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,043
Miss Misato Katsuragi

22
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,765
He's run away.
I suppose that's not surprising.

00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,241
Well...

26
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:52,138
We're lkari's classmates,
Aida and Suzuhara, Ma'am.

27
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,249
Aida and Suzuhara?

28
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,061
Yes, Ma'am!

29
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,138
I'm Suzuhara.

30
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,678
Aren't you the boys who got in
Unit 01's entry plug?

31
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:01,571
Yes, Ma'am!

32
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,825
We're sorry for causing so much trouble.

33
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,285
Actually, lkari's been absent ever since then,

34
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,869
so we came to see if he was okay.

35
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:14,414
He's at the Nerv training facility right now.

36
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,358
Oh, I see.

37
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,820
These are the printouts that were
building up on lkari's desk.

38
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,523
Oh, sorry for your trouble. Thank you.

39
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,803
Well, we'll be leaving now.

40
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,128
Please say "hi" to lkari for us.

41
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,814
Yeah, I will. Bye.

42
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,493
This is an unexpected development.

43
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:40,632
She was a real babe, wasn't she?

44
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:45,801
Shinji, you idiot!

45
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,297
Idiot!

46
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:00,906
The next station is
Nagao Toge, Nagao Toge.

47
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,047
The exit will switch to the right side.

48
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:05,667
Thank you for using New Tokyo-3
Loop Seven.

49
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,745
This train will be going out of service
at this station.

50
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:16,123
Please, make sure you take all of your
belongings as you exit the train.

51
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:23,609
I've got to go back.

52
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,108
Hey there! We're offering you
a great bargain!

53
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,330
Hot young babes serving
heavenly refreshment!

54
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,943
Special services to heal your tired body,
services to fill you with energy!

55
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,105
You really couldn't detect it, Doctor?!!

56
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,650
Yes. An object only ten
millimeters in diameter

57
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,110
crashed into Antarctica at close
to the speed of light.

58
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,480
The technology we had was unable
to predict or prevent such a thing.

59
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,697
It's like hell out there! Just what is
the purpose of science?!

60
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,300
The atmospheric flux caused by the
change in the Earth's axis

61
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,390
has decreased by 3%.

62
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,529
So it's getting a little better?

63
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,818
No, there's still a tidal wave approaching
at 230 meters a second!

64
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,633
Doctor! We must evacuate!

65
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,236
It's my duty to remain here.

66
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,302
Doctor, choosing death is easy,

67
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:10,471
but you have an obligation
to watch this living hell!

68
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:25,207

71
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,360
Idiot.

72
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,633
Arrival Stop Only

73
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,940
He's only fourteen years old.

74
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:23,467
It seems so cruel, making him bear
the burden of mankind's destiny.

75
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:29,484
But we have no choice but to entrust the
piloting of the Evas to fourteen year olds.

76
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,820
I know.

77
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,184
So, has he called?

78
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,052
No?

79
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:43,143
No. I think he might never come back.

80
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:45,627
What are you going to do?

81
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,262
Nothing really.

82
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,577
If he won't come back,
maybe that's for the better.

83
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,480
Why?

84
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,445
After the battle the other day...

85
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,459
Why did you ignore my order?

86
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:00,955
I'm sorry.

87
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:04,175
I'm the one who's in charge
of your operations, right?

88
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,157
Yes.

89
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,851
You have a duty to obey my orders.
Do you understand?

90
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,176
Yes.

91
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,050
I'm warning you, never do it again.

92
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:12,932
Yes.

93
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,226
Do you really understand what I'm saying?!

94
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:16,458
Yes.

95
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:20,726
Hey, you're not going to get out of this
by just saying yes to everything I say.

96
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:25,401
I know that. That's enough, isn't it?
We won the battle anyway.

97
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,310
You know, it may seem easy to go along
with whatever anyone else wants,

98
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:33,237
but if you get into the Eva with that attitude,
it'll kill you!

99
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,747
I don't care.

100
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,130
1t'd be nice if I could say you've got
the right attitude,

101
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,472
but if you expect to get any praise out of me,
you're wrong, Shiniji lkari.

102
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,619
That's not the point. In any case, I'm the
only one who can pilot it, aren't 1?

103
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:49,615
Il do it.

104
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,730
I see.

105
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:58,341
If piloting an Eva means nothing
but pain to him,

106
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,268
he shouldn't get into it again.

107
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,070
Otherwise, I'm sure he'll get killed.

108
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,413
But we need pilots.

109
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,306
Captain!

110
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,055
Aida, go on ahead!

111
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:21,831
But I can't go and leave you behind!

112
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,256
You fool!

113
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,091
Upsy-daisy.

114
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:42,701
The new kid?

115
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:44,880
Ikari!

Toji was sorry about that.

118
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,236
Toji was sorry about that.

119
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,905
He said that his kid sister scolded him

120
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:11,341
and said that, "It was the robot
who saved our lives!"

121
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:15,685
That's pretty embarrassing, being
chewed out by a grade school kid.

122
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:17,576
Right?

123
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:25,428
I like it at night because those
noisy cicadas don't chirp.

124
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,595
Although I remember that it was pretty quiet
when I was a kid,

125
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,792
there've been more of them each year.

126
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:33,204
The ecosystem is returning
to its former state.

127
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,959
That's what Miss Misato said.

128
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:37,802
I see, Miss Misato said so.

129
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,674
I really envy you.

130
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:43,536
Living with such a beautiful woman
and piloting the Evangelion.

131
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,780
I wish I could get behind
the controls just once!

132
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:53,166
You shouldn't. I think your mother
would be worried.

133
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:58,104
Oh, don't worry about that. I don't have one.

134
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,177
I'm the same as you.

135
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,507
You'll have something to eat, won't you?

136
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:07,616
Yeah.

137
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,735
Do you usually do this sort of thing?

138
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,339
Huh? Well, sure.

139
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,860
Is this some kind of training for
guerilla warfare or something?

140
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,987
How could I fight with toys like these?
It's just for fun.

141
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,769
You're Shiniji Ikari, aren't you?

142
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:49,985
Yes.

143
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,576
We're from Nerv Security Intelligence.

144
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:57,039
Under Article 8 of the Security Act,
we're taking you to headquarters.

145
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,261
All right?

146
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:00,269
Yes.

147
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:06,737
And all you did was stand there?

148
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,800
That's easy for you to say!

149
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:11,802
But it's like I said, they were Nerv
Security Intelligence, professionals.

150
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:16,098
So what?! Don't you have any balls at all?!

151
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:17,586
Sissy!

152
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,280
Pervert!

153
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:18,921
Apel

154
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:21,405
Only an idiot fights when
he knows he can't win.

155
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,671
Balls have nothing to do with it.

156
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,715
Long time, no see.

157
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:37,742
Yes.

158
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,847
Do you feel any better after wandering
around for two days?

159
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,011
I don't know.

160
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:46,303
The Eva is on standby. Will you pilot it?

161
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:48,814
Or won't you?

162
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,572
You're not going to scold me
for running away?

163
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,236
Of course not. I'm not related to you, am 1?

164
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,681
If I say that I won't pilot Unit 01,
what will you do with it?

165
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,218
I suppose that Rei will do it.

166
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:09,718
Won't you pilot it?

167
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:15,257
It seems unrealistic for you
to force everything on her.

168
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:18,172
Don't worry. I'll pilot it.

169
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,098
But you don't want to do it?

170
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,870
Of course not. To begin with, it's not
something that comes to me naturally.

171
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,577
But Ayanami, Miss Misato and Miss Ritsuko...

172
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,460
Cut that out!

173
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,606
This has nothing to do with any of us!

174
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,488
If you don't like it, get out of here!

175
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:37,233
Just forget all about Eva and us and
go back to where you came from!

176
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:42,291
We don't need someone
with that attitude piloting!

177
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,263
The Third Child is leaving
New Tokyo-3 tomorrow.

178
00:14:57,797 --> 00:15:00,347
Then we'll reconfigure
Unit 01's system for Rei.

179
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:01,817
But...

180
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,754
Regardless of the results of Unit 00's
re-activation experiments,

181
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,983
we'll move on to experimenting with Unit O1.

182
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:14,792
According to the Marduk
Organization's report,

183
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,578
the Fourth Child hasn't been found yet.

184
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:20,764
That means we can't get
any pilot replacements?

185
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,460
Excuse me, where is Miss Misato?
I'd like to say goodbye.

186
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,761
You're no longer Nerv personnel.

187
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,244
Therefore, we can't give you any information.

188
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,233
Ikari!

189
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,343
You forgot this!

190
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,639
Could you excuse me for a moment?

191
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,604
Thank you.

192
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:10,722
Hey, Toji.

193
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:12,427
Come on, say something!

194
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:19,177
Ikari, I'm sorry I hit you twice.
Please, hit me back!

195
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,271
I can't do that.

196
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,854
Please! Otherwise, I won't be satisfied.

197
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,270
See? He's a pretty embarrassing guy,
isn't he?

198
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:29,249
But if it'll put an end to this dispute,
why don't you go ahead and hit him?

199
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,360
But...

200
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,744
Hurry up! You don't have
much time, do you?

201
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,709
Okay, but only once.

202
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:38,523
Okay! Come on!

203
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:43,982
Hold it!

204
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,462
No holdin' back.

205
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:48,527
Right.

206
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:52,864
QOuch...

207
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,290
How did you know I'd be here?

208
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:10,120
Call it a hunch. We've seen
dozens of classmates off now.

209
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:18,249
If you're leavin', we'll have to leave
this city sometime soon,

210
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:25,040
but we can't blame you for that.
We saw how you suffered in the Eva.

211
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:29,259
And if anyone tries to blame you,

212
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,916
I'm gonna give them a head butt!

213
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:38,135
Hey, don't look so gloomy.

214
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,633
Take care.

215
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:40,819
Good luck!

216
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:41,877
Well...

217
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:44,489
It's time.

218
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,697
I'm the one who deserves to be hit!

219
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:18,558
I'm a scoundrel, a coward,

220
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,956
spineless and weak...

221
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,470
Don't give us any more trouble.

222
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:38,626
Eva Unit 01 will be entering Stage 2
cryo-stasis for activation system rewrite.

223
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:40,792
He's gone.

224
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:45,832
Was it for the best?

225
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,426
The "Hedgehog's Dilemma*.

226
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,452
The closer we become,
the more deeply we hurt each other.

227
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,099
Now I understand.

228
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,657
That boy...

229
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:03,586
He can't let others know how he feels
in any other way.

230
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:09,638

for Atsugi is arriving on Track 2.

Hang in there.

238
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,800
Look!

239
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,118
It's that babel

240
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:18,774

is now arriving on Track 4.

Welcome home.

249

Rei Ayanami limits her association
with others as much as possible.

252
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,392
The only one she opens up to
is Commander lkari.

253
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,973

who is closer to his own father than he is.
