1
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:06,502
Just like the cruel angel

2
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:14,181
Young boy, become a legend

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:28,290
Even though the untested breeze
taps at the door to your heart

4
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:36,590
You just look solely at me and smile

5
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:43,071
So intent on seeking out that gentle touch

6
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:51,082
Such innocent eyes, still ignorant
of their destiny

7
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:58,089
But someday, you are sure to realize
that upon your back

8
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:06,007
You have the wings with which to fly
towards the distant future

9
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:11,202
The cruel angel's thesis

10
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:14,940
Soon, you will take flight from the windowsill

11
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:18,711
With your torrent of ardent pathos

12
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:22,414
If you are to betray our memories

13
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:26,051
You, who embrace these heavens and shine

14
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:29,333
Young boy, become a legend

15
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,997
Good morning, Shinji. How are you?

16
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:40,433
I'm getting used to it.

17
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,000
I think it's not bad.

18
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,402
That's good.

19
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,838
Have you memorized the positions
of all the Eva emergence points,

20
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:49,319
emergency power junctions, armament
buildings, and recovery zones?

21
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:50,943
I think so.

22
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:51,410
Then, I'll review it one more time.
I think so.

23
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,911
Then, I'll review it one more time.

24
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:55,982
Normally the Eva runs off electricity
provided by an umbilical cable.

25
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,452
In emergencies, it can switch to
an internal battery,

26
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,288
with an active life of one minute at full power,

27
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,949
and no more than five minutes in
the minimal activity gain mode.

28
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,916
This is the limitations of
our current technology.

29
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:09,799
Do you understand?

30
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,130
Yes.

31
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,261
Now let's continue from where we left off
yesterday. We'll initiate Induction Mode.

32
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,939
Position the target in the center,

33
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:22,725
then switch "on".

34
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,640
Calm down. Position the target in the center.

35
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,209
Switch...

36
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,048
Next!

37
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:48,466
But I'm surprised that Shinji
agreed to pilot it.

38
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,803
He simply does what he's told to do.

39
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,644
Maybe that's his way of getting through life.

40
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:00,141
Target in the center, pull the switch.

41
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,391
Target in the center, pull the switch.

42
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,720
Target in the center, pull the switch.

43
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,371
Target in the center, pull the switch.

44
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,408
Target in the center...

45
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:16,767
The Silent Phone
Episode Three

46
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:22,101
And now, from Tokyo we go to
Miss Natsuko Shinohara in Matsuzaki.

47
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:25,322
Good morning, this is Shinohara.
Guess what?

48
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:29,409
Today I'm in Matsuzaki in West Izu
for a little scuba diving!

49
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:30,643
Today's forecast is sunny, with an
estimated high of 32 degrees C.

50
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:33,245
Miss Misato, it's morning already.
Today's forecast is sunny, with an
estimated high of 32 degrees C.

51
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:33,879
Miss Misato, it's morning already.
We have hot days all year now,
but we used to have four seasons:

52
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,180
We have hot days all year now,
but we used to have four seasons:

53
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:37,216
I just got back from night duty.
We have hot days all year now,

00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:37,850
I just got back from night duty.

55
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:37,983
I just got back from night duty.
Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter.

56
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,619
I don't have to go to work until this
evening, so please, let me sleep.
Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter.

57
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,787
I don't have to go to work until this
evening, so please, let me sleep.
We never see snow these days,
instead, due to the recent warmth,

58
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:43,422
We never see snow these days,
instead, due to the recent warmth,

59
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,257
I see. I'll go.
We never see snow these days,
instead, due to the recent warmth,

60
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:45,558
We never see snow these days,
instead, due to the recent warmth,

61
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:45,658
aquatic life has been coming back
little by little.

62
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,025
Hey, is today Thursday?
aquatic life has been coming back
little by little.

63
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:47,593
Hey, is today Thursday?
As you dive into the sea you can
clearly see an abundance of fish.

64
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,029
Take the burnable trash
to the garbage, please.
As you dive into the sea you can
clearly see an abundance of fish.

65
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,063
As you dive into the sea you can
clearly see an abundance of fish.

66
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:51,230
Yes, Ma'am.
As you dive into the sea you can
clearly see an abundance of fish.

67
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:51,997
Yes, Ma'am.

68
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:52,732
It makes me think of catching some
for tonight's dinner.

69
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,468
So, are you adjusting to school?
It makes me think of catching some
for tonight's dinner.

70
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:55,968
It makes me think of catching some
for tonight's dinner.

71
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,303
Yeah.
It makes me think of catching some
for tonight's dinner.

72
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,472
Oh, okay. See you later.
It makes me think of catching some
for tonight's dinner.

73
00:03:59,473 --> 00:03:59,972
Oh, okay. See you later.
Although the town brings back sad
memories, this is a hot diving spot.

74
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:00,172
Although the town brings back sad
memories, this is a hot diving spot.

75
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,640
I'll see you later.
Although the town brings back sad
memories, this is a hot diving spot.

76
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:02,131
Although the town brings back sad
memories, this is a hot diving spot.

77
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,139
Yes? Hello?

78
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,632
Oh, it's you, Ritsuko.

79
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,729
How's it going? Are you getting along
with your boyfriend?

80
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,331
Boyfriend?

81
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,366
Oh, you mean Shinji.

82
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,136
Well, he transferred into school two
weeks ago and he hasn't changed.

83
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:33,005
No one ever calls him.

84
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,025
Calls him?

85
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:38,511
Well, since I figured he'd need one,
I gave him a cell phone a while back.

86
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:42,262
I don't think he's ever used it though,
or received any calls.

87
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:47,057
I'm not sure, but I don't think
he has any friends.

88
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:51,683
Well, I would guess that Shinji's not
the sort who makes friends easily.

89
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:55,303
Do you know the fable of the
"Hedgehog's Dilemma"?

90
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,898
Hedgehog? You mean those animals
with the spiny hair?

91
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:02,802
Even though a hedgehog may wish
to get close to another hedgehog,

92
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,493
the closer they get, the more they
injure each other with their spines.

93
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,675
It's the same with some humans.

94
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:14,676
Shinji is probably afraid of pain and has
become a coward somewhere in his heart.

95
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:18,617
Well, he'll eventually learn that growing up

96
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:22,254
means getting closer to people
and distancing them,

97
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:26,205
finding a distance where you can avoid
hurting each other too much.

98
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,407
What's up, class rep?

99
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:42,007
Class Daybook

100
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,210
Class Daybook
Did you give him the printout
I gave you yesterday?

101
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:45,077
Class Daybook
What? Well...

102
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:45,428
What? Well...

103
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,140
Well, there wasn't anybody home
at Toji's place.

104
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,987
Aida, you're good friends
with Suzuhara, right?

105
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,117
He's been absent for two weeks.
Aren't you worried?

106
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,224
Do you suppose he's been seriously injured?

107
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,395
What? In that robot incident?!

108
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,661
The television report said
that nobody was injured!

109
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,382
No way, you saw the explosion site
on Mount Takanosu, didn't you?

110
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,560
Not only were Iruma and
Komatsu dispatched,

111
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:11,361
they brought in troops from
Misawa and Kyushu.

112
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:14,581
There had to have been well over
a couple dozen people injured,

113
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,121
and even some killed.

114
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,010
Toji!

115
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,322
Suzuharal

116
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,371
Wow, has the class population
dropped or what?

117
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:28,520
They've all evacuated and
transferred to other schools.

118
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,131
After all, no one wants to stay after
that fierce battle inside the city.

119
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,948
Yeah, you're probably the only one

120
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,057
who's actually enjoyin' the chance
to see a real war.

121
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:37,323
I suppose so.

122
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,020
So where have you been, Toji?
You were gone for so long.

123
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,310
Did you get caught in the crossfire
or something?

124
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,984
My kid sister did.

125
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,504
She was crushed under a pile of debris.

126
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:54,431
She survived, but she's been
in the hospital ever since.

127
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:58,108
Both my pop and gramps work at the lab,

128
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:01,162
and there's no way they can
leave their posts right now.

129
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,513
So, if I ain't with her, she's all alone
at the hospital.

130
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:10,438
Man, that robot's pilot was plain awful!
I'm downright pissed off!

131
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,597
What the hell's the point of
our own guy wreckin' the city?

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,190
Oh, about the pilot, have you heard the
rumor about the new transfer student?

133
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,224
Transfer student?

134
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:20,816
Him, over there.

135
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:25,032
He transferred here while you were absent.

136
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,722
He came right after the incident.
Don't you think that's odd?

137
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,592
All rise!

138
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:40,866
And so, humankind was about to face
its greatest trial.

139
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,561
In the last year of the 20th century,

140
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:48,147
the massive meteor from space slammed
into the continent of Antarctica.

141
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:52,232
The continent's ice cap was melted
almost instantaneously.

142
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:56,108
The water level of the oceans rose,
the Earth was thrown off its axis,

143
00:07:56,109 --> 00:08:01,109
and abnormal weather patterns threatened
the lives of all living things.

144
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:06,414
Several thousand species and half of the
world's population were lost for eternity.

145
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:12,028
That was the so-called "Second Impact".

146
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,462
The survivors still had to live through the hell

147
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:19,064
of worldwide economic collapse,
ethnic conflicts, and civil wars.

148
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,232
Is it true that you're the pilot of that robot?
YN
of worldwide economic collapse,
ethnic conflicts, and civil wars.

149
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,513
Is it true that you're the pilot of that robot?
YN
However, it has been fifteen years since then.

150
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:26,301
In only fifteen years,
we have restored ourselves.

151
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,209
This is certainly proof of the human race's
resilience, but even more so,

152
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,777
It's true, isn't it?
This is certainly proof of the human race's
resilience, but even more so,

153
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:32,707
This is certainly proof of the human race's
resilience, but even more so,

154
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:36,556
it is the fruit of the blood, sweat and tears

155
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:41,920
your fathers and mothers have
dedicated to this cause.

156
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,821
What?!

157
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:45,124
Really?! Oh, wow! Cool!

158
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,158
Really?! Oh, wow! Cool!
I lived in Nebukawa at the time,
which is underwater now...

159
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,960
Really, the new student was?
I lived in Nebukawa at the time,
which is underwater now...

160
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:48,894
Really, the new student was?

161
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,095
Hey, you guys!

162
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,497
We're still in class, you know!

163
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:52,765
Sit down now!

164
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,800
Aw, you're always so bossy!

165
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:55,634
It's okay, it's okay!

166
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:56,101
It's not okay!
It's okay, it's okay!

167
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:56,742
It's not okay!

168
00:08:59,172 --> 00:08:59,972
Well...

169
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,107
Hey, how were you chosen?

170
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,709
Were there any tests?

171
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,743
Weren't you scared?

172
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,612
What's the cockpit look like?

173
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:09,363
Well, that's all secret.

174
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,374
Hey, what's the name of the robot?

175
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,122
I don't know much, but everyone
calls it Eva or Unit 01.

176
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:17,853
Eva?

177
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,014
And what's its ultimate attack?

178
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,625
Some kind of knife.

179
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,838
It vibrates... An ultra-sonic wave...

180
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,668
That's amazing! You're the pride
of the school!

181
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,028
Yeah, right! Cool!

182
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,480
And thus...

183
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,223
Oh...

184
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,227
That's all for today.

185
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,319
Ikari, where do you live?
All rise! Bow!

186
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,237
Hey, you guys, why don't you at least
show some manners at the end?

187
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:55,231
Sorry, transfer student,
but I've gotta beat you up!

188
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,344
I won't feel right until I've smacked you.

189
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:04,396
Sorry, his little sister was injured
in the incident the other day.

190
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,178
Well, there you have it.

191
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:11,792
I'm not piloting it by choice either.

192
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,159
An emergency call.

193
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:45,843
I'll go on ahead.

194
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,089
A special state of emergency
has been declared

195
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,126
for the Kanto and Chubu regions
surrounding the Tokai district.

196
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,737
All residents must evacuate to their
designated shelters immediately.

197
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,328
Repeating...

198
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:22,647
The target has been sighted by our cameras.

199
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,311
It's already penetrated into
our territorial waters.

200
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:26,723
All personnel, assume
battle stations, Level One.

201
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,366
Roger, prepare for anti-aircraft interception.

202
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:32,446
New Tokyo-3 transforming
to battle formation.

203
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,702
Initiate accommodation of the central block.

204
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,260
Accommodation of central block

205
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,154
and the first through seventh districts
has been completed.

206
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,932
Notification of the government and other
related ministries, completed.

207
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,567
Target is still advancing.

208
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,608
Present operational rate of anti-aircraft
interception: 48%.

209
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,299
What's the status of noncombatants
and civilians?

210
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:24,343
We've already received reports that
the evacuation has been completed.

211
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,074
Underground Shelter 334
Disaster Prevention Department, Tokyo-3
Total Floor Space Maximum Capacity

212
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,169
Attention, elementary school and
junior high school students.

213
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:29,047
Please form groups with
your individual classes.

214
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,750
At noon today, a special emergency declaration
was issued for the Kanto and Central regions
centering on the Tokai area.
Details will be reported as they come in.
Please form groups with
your individual classes.

215
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,784
At noon today, a special emergency declaration
was issued for the Kanto and Central regions
centering on the Tokai area.
Details will be reported as they come in.

216
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:33,785
At noon today, a special emergency declaration
was issued for the Kanto and Central regions
centering on the Tokai area.
Details will be reported as they come in.
Not again!

217
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:34,045
Not again!

218
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,263
Just text messages again?

219
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:40,283
It's news censorship. They won't
show any of it to us civilians.

220
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,504
Even though it's an incredible event.

221
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,242
The fourth Angel would show up
while Commander lkari is away.

222
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,193
It's a lot sooner than we expected.

223
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,252
The last time they gave us
a fifteen year break.

224
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,714
This time it's been only three weeks.

225
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:59,096
They never care about
our convenience, do they?

226
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,115
They're the type we women hate the most.

227
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:03,964
Hakone Ropeway

228
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,805
It's a waste of the taxpayers' money.

229
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,057
The committee is demanding that
we dispatch an Evangelion again.

230
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,424
Those pesky bastards.

231
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:18,536
Even if they hadn't asked for it,
I'd have dispatched it anyway.

232
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,793
Entry procedure initiated.

233
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:26,815
LCL oxygenated.

234
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,380
Releasing airlock.

235
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,919
Why am I piloting this thing again,
even though my father's not here?

236
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:37,332
Even though I got beat up?

237
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,416
Hey, I need to talk to you,
privately, you know?

238
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:45,591
What for?

239
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,428
Just give me a second, okay?

240
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:48,957
Well, okay.

241
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:51,403
Class rep!

242
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,304
What?

243
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,485
We both hafta go to the john!

244
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,294
You were supposed to use the bathroom
before you came here.

245
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,544
So, what's this about?

246
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:02,206
I've got to see it, at least once in my life.

247
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:03,747
You mean the battle up there?

248
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,996
Nobody knows when the enemy
will come the next time.

249
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,848
Kensuke, are you serious?

250
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,129
Do not use
If we let this opportunity escape us,
we may lose it forever!

251
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,038
Please, help me unlock the gate.

252
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:16,855
But you'll get killed if you go out there.

253
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:18,763
You don't know if that'll happen,
even if we stay here.

254
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,928
If I could be killed anyway,
I'd rather see it first.

255
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,100
Idiot. What do you think Nerv's for?

256
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:26,964
And what is Nerv's most important weapon?

257
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,416
It's the robot the new kid pilots.

258
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,759
He protected us the other day,

259
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:34,915
but you hit him pretty hard. Twice!

260
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:39,551
If he refuses to pilot the robot,
we're all going to die.

261
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:44,146
Don't you have a duty to watch him fight?

262
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,574
Ah, whatever.

263
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,949
You sure are upfront about what you want,
ain't you?

264
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,968
Shinji, are you ready to head out?

265
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:56,972
Yes.

266
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:01,230
Listen to me. Neutralize the enemy's AT field,
then fire a volley from the pallet gun.

267
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,815
Do it just like we practiced.
Can you handle that?

268
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,337
Yes.

269
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:06,208
Launch!

270
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,145
Cool! All my efforts really paid off!

271
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,119
Oh! This is what I've been waiting for!

272
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:40,502
There it is!

273
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,677
The AT field has been deployed.
Target in the center, pull the switch.

274
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,848
Do it just as planned, okay, Shinji?
Target in the center, pull the switch.

275
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:49,064
Right.

276
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:58,062
You idiot! You hid the enemy
with your own smoke!

277
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,877
What the hell?! He's already losing!

278
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,133
It's all right.

279
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:13,767
I'm sending you a spare rifle.

280
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:15,524
Take it!

281
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:18,746
Shinji? Shinji?

282
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,239
Oh, man!

283
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,684
Being beaten up must have
really messed him up.

284
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,069
Shut up!

285
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,139
The umbilical cable's been severed!

286
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,776
Eva has switched to its internal
battery power source.

287
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:54,267
4 minutes, 53 seconds
of activation remaining.

288
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,185
It's comin' this way!

289
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,997
Shinji, are you all right? Shinji!

290
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:12,831
Damage report?

291
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,122
No problems detected. He can make it.

292
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,731
Shinji's classmates?

293
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,153
What are they doing there?

294
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,357
Why won't he fight?

295
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,588
Because we're here?

296
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:46,571
He can't move because of us!

297
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:49,996
Unit 01 activation time remaining,
3 minutes 28 seconds.

298
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,189
Shinji, let them into the cockpit!

299
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,400
Once you've got them,
make a temporary retreat.

300
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,594
We'll regroup!

301
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,149
You think you can allow unauthorized
civilians into the entry plug?!

302
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,484
I'm authorizing it.

303
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,499
You're exceeding your authority,
Captain Katsuragi!

304
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,220
Unit 01's remaining activation time,
3 minutes.

305
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:17,666
Hold Eva on your current commands
and eject the entry plug. Hurry up!

306
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,223
You two! Get in! Hurry!

307
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,007
What the... It's water?

308
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:28,426
My camera! My camera!

309
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,252
Abnormal conditions occurring
in the nervous system!

310
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,767
Of course. It's because you've allowed
two foreign bodies into the plug.

311
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,289
They're introducing noise
in the nerve impulse systems!

312
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,879
Now! Retreat!

313
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,199
Recovery route 34, retreat to
the east side of the mountain.

314
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,567
Hey, new kid, she said, "Retreat!"
Recovery route 34, retreat to
the east side of the mountain.

315
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:56,528
Hey, new kid, she said, "Retreat!"

316
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:58,696
I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away.
New kid!

317
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:00,548
I mustn't run away!

318
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,610
Progressive Knife engaged!

319
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,022
Obey my orders, Shinji! You've got to retreat!

320
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:10,735
Shinji!

321
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,138
That idiot...

322
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,261
Unit 01, activation time
remaining, 30 seconds!

323
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:41,222
28...27...

324
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,687
26... 25...

325
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,017
14...13...

326
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,809
12..11..

327
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:53,841
10... 9...

328
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,680
8..7..

329
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,451
6... 5...

330
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,460
4.

331
00:19:58,631 --> 00:19:59,391
3.

332
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:00,205
2.

333
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,216
1.

334
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,544
Eva Unit 01, activation ceased.

335
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,683
The target is completely silent.

336
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:58,151
It's been three days.

337
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,911
You mean, since we were chewed out?

338
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:05,378
No, since he stopped comin' to school.

339
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:06,971
Who's "he"?

340
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,189
The new kid, the new kid.

341
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,712
I wonder what he's been doin' since then?

342
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,083
Are you worried about him?

343
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:16,045
No, not exactly worried.

344
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,902
Toji, for someone who's so tactless,
you're pretty stubborn.

345
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:22,589
If you had apologized to him back then,

346
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,475
you wouldn't have had to agonize
over it for three days.

347
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:28,495
Here, this is the new kid's phone number.

348
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,291
If you're so worried, why don't you call him?

349
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,513

Unable to overcome his feelings,
Shinji even runs away from Misato.

352
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:10,755
Unable to overcome his feelings,
Shinji even runs away from Misato.

353
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,625
But the organization brings him
back without hesitation.

354
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:15,894
There were no kind words waiting for him.

00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,630
Next Evangelion:
