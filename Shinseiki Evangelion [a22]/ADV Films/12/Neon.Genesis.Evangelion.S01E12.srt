The Value of a Miracle
Episode Twelve

19
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,875
Thanks, Shinji, you really saved us
from the rain.

20
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,009
Where's Miss Misato?

21
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,744
I guess she must still be asleep.

22
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,680
She's been working all night recently.

23
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,051
That's right, she has a tough job.

24
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:07,104
Let's keep it quiet so that we don't wake her up.

25
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,060
What are you guys doing here?!

26
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:14,931
Taking shelter from the rain.

27
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,329
You sure you guys aren't after me?

28
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,791
Well, I'm changing, so if you peep, I'll kill you!

29
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:23,896
Shut up, ya idiot!

30
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:27,540
Who'd wanna see ya changin' clothes?!

31
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,151
She's way too self-conscious.

32
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,214
Sorry for disturbing you!

33
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,965
Well, welcome, you two.

34
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:42,787
I see you're back. We've got a harmonics test
tonight, so don't be late.

35
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:43,856
Right.

36
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,591
Did you hear that, Asuka?

37
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:46,882
Yes, Ma'am!

38
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,665
Congratulations on your promotion!

39
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,667
Congratulations!

40
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:55,868
Thank you.

41
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,449
You're most welcome.

42
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,591
Well, see you later.

43
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,421
See youl!

44
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,046
What's up? Did something happen
to Miss Misato?

45
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:08,981
Didn't you see her collar tab?

46
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,850
The number of lines increased to two.

47
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,018
That means that she's been promoted
from captain to major.

48
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,749
Really? I didn't notice that.

49
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:16,622
Yeah, I wonder when...

50
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,493
Are ya serious? You guys are pathetic!

51
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,887
Don't you two have any compassion?

52
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:29,058
You know, it's a tough job for someone so young
to foster two junior high kids!

53
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,203
We're the only ones who've got
any human compassion.

54
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,486
Units 00 and 02 are both on the edge
of the contamination zone.

55
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,521
They've reached their limit.

56
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:50,823
Unit 01 can still tolerate
a little more though, can't he?

57
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:53,194
Lower the graph depth another 0.3.

58
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,901
He's almost reached the contamination zone.

59
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:05,004
And he's still getting these readings? Incredible.

60
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:08,574
His harmonics and sync rate are
also catching up with Asuka's.

61
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,810
Is this what you call a gift, l wonder?

62
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,471
It's like he was born to pilot an Eva.

63
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,080
Even if he doesn't want to.

64
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,690
I doubt that'll make him happy.

65
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,435
Good work, you three.

66
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,460
Shinji, you did well.

67
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,728
What do you mean?

68
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,665
Your harmonics value increased by
eight points since the last test.

69
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,933
That's very good.

70
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,602
But it's still fifty points lower than mine!

71
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:39,672
Yes, but it's eight points in ten days.
That's impressive.

72
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,043
That's not impressive!

73
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,542
Isn't that great?

74
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,413
Such words of praise for you!

75
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,411
I'm going on ahead, idiot!

76
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:54,286
...and that was a postcard from
"Mr. Wah" of Tokyo-2.

77
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,121
But you know, don't get all sulky
because you got dumped by a girl.

78
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:59,625
Congratulations on your promotion.
But you know, don't get all sulky

79
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,160
Thanks.
When I was a kid, this area
was filled with barracks

80
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,495
But to be honest, I'm not really all that thrilled.

81

and we were just grateful
if we got to eat that day.

82
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,364
I can understand that.
and we were just grateful
if we got to eat that day.

83
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:10,069
Getting praised like earlier doesn't make me
all that happy either.
We didn't have the leisure to do anything
about the people we liked.

84
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,236
All it does is make Asuka angry.
We didn't have the leisure to do anything

Our parents are safe and food isn't a problem,
so we have a lot to be thankful for in this era.

86
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,939
Our parents are safe and food isn't a problem,
so we have a lot to be thankful for in this era.

87
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,608
I wonder why she got mad?
We live in a great time in which
we can really enjoy happiness.

88
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,910
What did I do wrong?
We live in a great time in which
we can really enjoy happiness.

We live in a great time in which

90
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,013
That bothers you?
We live in a great time in which

91
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:21,413
That bothers you?
You got that, Mr. Wah?

92
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:22,715
Yes.
You got that, Mr. Wah?

93
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,515
That's because all you ever do is worry
about what other people think.
You got that, Mr. Wah?

94

Thanks, guys!

99
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,296
Thank you, Suzuhara.

100
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:40,232
Nah. He's the one who came up with this.

101
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:44,970
That's right! I, Kensuke Aida was the planner!
Kensuke Aida!

102
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,705
Thank you, Aida.

103
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:50,546
Oh, no, all I did was what
anybody would have done!

104
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,613
But why's the class rep here?

105
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,224
Because I invited her.

106
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,251
Right?

107
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,352
What about Rei?

108
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,254
Of course I invited her,

109
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,534
but that girl's unsociable.

110
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,426
Man, Mr. Kaji's so late.

111
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,128
Is Mr. Kaji really that cool?

112
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,529
Totally!

113
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,132
He's so much better than these dorks
that it's like night and day.

114
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,501
It's an insult to compare him to them.

115
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,169
What'd ya say?!

116
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,470
Let's hear that again!

117
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,440
Is it still difficult for you to be
in this kind of situation?

118
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,741
I'm okay.

119
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,476
I'm just not used to being with

120
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,616
SO many people.

121
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,816
Why do they have to be so noisy?

122
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,389
A promotion...

123
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,260
That means that people have
acknowledged your work, right?

124
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,595
Yeah, I suppose.

125
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,786
That's why they're happy.

126
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,467
But it doesn't make you happy?

127
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,278
Oh, it's not like I'm not happy. I am, a little.

128
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:55,240
But that's not the reason I work here.

129
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:58,510
Then why did you join Nerv?

130
00:07:58,511 --> 00:07:58,644
Congrats
Major
Then why did you join Nerv?

131

132
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:02,314

Well, it's been so long that I forgot.

133
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:06,765
Congrats
Major

134
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,191
That's got to be Mr. Kajil

135
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,027
I came directly from HQ. We just
happened to meet on the way.

136
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,595
That's rather suspicious.

137
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,998
Oh, are you jealous?

138
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,599
As if.

139
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,440
Anyway, I'd like to offer my congratulations,
Major Katsuragi.

140
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:27,206
I guess  can't gripe to you anymore.

141
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,174
What are you trying to say, you jerk?

142
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,776
But anyway, it's unprecedented

143
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:34,213
for both the Commander and Vice Commander
to leave Japan together.

144
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:37,616
That just shows how they trust you
to hold down the fort while they're gone.

145
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:39,651
My father's not here?

146
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,932
Commander lkari is at the South Pole right now.

147
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:50,002
The South Pole, a world of death
which permits no life to exist.

148
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:54,466
Or should I simply call it Hell?

149
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:57,569
Nevertheless, we, mankind, are here.

150
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,772
We're living things, and we're alive.

151
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:02,241
That's because we're under the
protection of science.

152
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,843
Science is the power of man.

153
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:09,034
That arrogance is what caused the tragedy
of fifteen years ago, the Second Impact.

154
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,251
And here is the end result.

155
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:15,721
This is a greater punishment than we deserve.

156
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,923
This is truly the Dead Sea.

157
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:21,727
Yet this is a world that has been purified,
purged of the original sin.

158
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:26,131
I'd prefer a world where people live,
no matter how stained with sin.

00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:29,535
Reporting. Telegram received
from Nerv Headquarters.

160
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:32,165
An Angel has been detected in orbit
above the Indian Ocean.

161
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,407
It appeared suddenly, two minutes ago.

162
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,609
Search Satellite 6 moving to that orbit.

163
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,311
Two minutes to contact.

164
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,742
We have video of the target.

165
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,583
That's impressive.

166
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,652
Now that's just ridiculous.

167
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,323
Closing on target.

168
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,493
Start search.

169
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:55,924
Data transmission commencing.

170
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:57,396
Reception confirmed.

171
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:58,327
Commencing analysis.

172
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,934
Was that an AT Field?

173
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,425
It's a new way of using it.

174
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,944
What incredibly destructive power.

175
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,046
That's an AT Field!

176
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,548
It's using kinetic energy too.

177
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,384
It's like this Angel is a bomb in and of itself.

178
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:22,821
In any case, the first blast was way off
and hit the Pacific.

179
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:25,090
And two hours later,
the second shot struck there.

180
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,261
Since then, it has been steadily
adjusting for error.

181
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,695
That means it's learning.

182
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:30,362
That means it's learning.

183
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,998
N2 aerial mines had no effect on it either.

185
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,468
The Angel's movements
since then are unknown.

186
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,203
It's probably coming here.

187
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,343
Yes, and next time it'll drop itself.

188
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:44,476
So, that will give us a third Ashinoko Lake?

189
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,679
All five Fuji Lakes will be fused into
a single body linked to the Pacific,

190
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,248
taking Headquarters with it.

191
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:50,359
What about Commander lkari?

192
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,820
We're unable to contact him
due to the Angel's powerful jamming.

193
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,388
What is the Magi's judgment?

194
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,579
They unanimously agree
in recommending evacuation.

195
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,126
What will you do?

196
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,562
You're the one who's in charge now.

197
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:05,497
Notify all of the Japanese government ministries.

198
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,967
Under special declaration D-17,
provided for under Nerv's authority,

199
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:12,371
all residents within radius of 50km
are to evacuate immediately.

200
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:15,207
Ask Matsushiro to back up the Magi.

201
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,042
We're abandoning this location?

202
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:20,673
No, but it's not necessary
to place everyone at risk.

203
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:25,083
A D-17 Special Declaration has been
made by the government.

204
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:25,584
All Lanes Outgoing
A D-17 Special Declaration has been
made by the government.

205
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:28,754
All Lanes Outgoing
All residents must evacuate to their
designated locations.

206
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:29,621
All residents must evacuate to their
designated locations.

207
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,890
Beginning with the 6th and 7th blocks,

208
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,961
move according to your district chief's
direction immediately.

209
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,639
The evacuation of the city is complete.

210
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,167
In accordance with Department Alert C,

211
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,538
the evacuation of noncombatants and
D class personnel has been completed.

212
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,509
You're going to do this? Seriously?

213
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,311
Yes, l am.

214
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:55,948
You're going to throw away all three Evas
with your selfish decision?

215
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,608
The chance of success is only 0.00001%!

216
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,949
That's not even one in ten thousand!

217
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:05,224
It's not zero. I'm just banking on the Evas.

218
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,825
Major Katsuragi!

219
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,376
I am currently in charge.

220
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,565
I want to do whatever I can.

221
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,667
Destroying Angels is my duty.

222
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,570
Your duty? Don't make me laugh.

223
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,138
This is for your own sake, isn't it?

224
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,039
Your revenge against the Angels!

225
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,285
WHAAAAAAT?

226
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,065
Catch it in our hands?

227
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:38,690
That's right. We'll position the Evas
in the estimated drop zone.

228
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:42,321
You'll catch it while maintaining your
AT Fields at full strength.

229
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,931
What if the Angel is far off course?

230
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,499
We'll be out of luck, then.

231
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,835
What if the Evas aren't able
to withstand the impact?

232
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,603
We're out of luck then too.

233
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,704
Our chance of success?

234
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,455
God only knows, is all I can say.

235
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,977
If we succeed, it'll truly be a miracle.

236
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:02,948
The only miracles with any value
are the ones you work.

237
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,550
Meaning, make it work somehow?

238
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:09,554
I'm sorry, but we have no other options
for this operation.

239
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,057
How can you call this an operation?!

240
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:14,326
You're right, we really can't.

241
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,077
So if you don't want to, you can refuse.

242
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,358
Are you all okay with this?

243
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:26,772
Regulations say you're technically supposed
to write a will. What do you want to do?

244
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:29,741
That's fine, I don't plan on needing one.

245
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,992
I'm fine too. I have no need.

246
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,429
I'm also fine.

247
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,282
I'm sorry.

248
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,351
Once this is over, I'll treat everyone
to a steak dinner!

249
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,519
What? Really?

250
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,687
I promise.

251
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:42,821
Yay!

252
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,323
Don't forget!

253
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,613
You can count on it.

254
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:54,566
So I suppose steak defines a great dinner.

255
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:58,070
Does she think a kid these days
would be impressed with steak?

256
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:01,907
That's why I say the Second Impact generation
has really cheap standards.

257
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:04,576
She can't help it.

258
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:08,714
What was with that "Yay!"?
Pretending you're so happy!

259
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:12,851
If it helps Miss Misato feel good about
being in command, what's wrong with that?

260
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:13,051
Now, since she's going to treat us,

261
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,887
Tokyo Gourmet
Now, since she's going to treat us,

262
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:16,521
Now, since she's going to treat us,

263
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,772
I wonder where we should have her take us?

264
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,994
You're coming with us this time.

265
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,663
I'm not going.

266
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:25,954
Why not?

267
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,368
I don't like meat.

268
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,728
Because of the Angel's radio disturbance,
the target has been lost.

269
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,140
We can't determine the exact location,

270
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:36,942
but based on the data up until we lost it,

271
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:39,778
the estimated point of impact
calculated by the Magi

272
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:40,879
is here.

273
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,348
The range is this wide?

274
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,617
The distance from one side
to the other is enormous.

275
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,553
Given the size of the target's AT Field,

276
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,257
it could totally annihilate HQ by hitting
anywhere in this zone.

277
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,994
Given that, we'll station the Evas
at each of these three points.

278
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,455
On what grounds is this dispersal based?

279
00:14:58,631 --> 00:14:59,664
Intuition.

280
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:00,699
Intuition?

281
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,667
Yes, a woman's intuition.

282
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,269
How slipshod!

283
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,606
I can see our miracle getting further
and further away.

284
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:10,677
Miss Misato has never won the lottery.

285
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:14,613
Say...

286
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:15,447
What?
Say...

287
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:16,028
What?

288
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,183
Asuka, why do you pilot an Eva?

289
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:22,421
To exhibit my talent to the world, of course.

290
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,022
You mean to prove that you exist?

291
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,513
Yeah, something like that.

292
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,119
You're not going to ask her?

293
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,742
I've asked Ayanami before.

294
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,113
My, how intimate the two of you are.

295
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:36,808
It's not like that.

296
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,900
Then what about you, Shinji?

297
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:40,901
I don't know.

298
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,837
You don't know? What are you, stupid?

299
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,011
Maybe  am.

300
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,591
You really are stupid.

301
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,460
One hundred twenty minutes
to estimated time of impact.

302
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:57,923
You all evacuate too.

303
00:15:57,924 --> 00:15:59,858
I can take care of this myself.

304
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:02,327
No, this is our job as well.

305
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,908
We can't let the kids risk
their lives by themselves.

306
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,672
They'll be fine.

307
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,202
Even if the Evas are badly damaged,

308
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:12,483
their AT Fields will protect the kids.

309
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,749
Inside an Eva is the safest place to be.

310
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:27,939
Shinji, yesterday you asked me
why I joined Nerv.

311
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:33,325
My father was a man who lived
for his research,

312
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,927
for his dreams, to the exclusion of all else.

313
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,658
I could never forgive him for that.

314
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,534
I even hated him.

315
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,427
Just like my father.

316
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:47,772
He never took care of me,
my mother or the family.

317
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,113
His friends always said he was
very sensitive and delicate.

318
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,579
But the truth was that he was just a weak person

319
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,150
running away from reality,
the reality called his family.

320
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,781
He was like a kid.

321
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,701
I readily agreed with my mother
when she decided to divorce him,

322
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:08,071
because she was always crying.

323
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,862
It seemed to have come as a shock to him,

324
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,113
but at the time, I laughed at him because I felt
he'd brought it on himself.

325
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:18,116
But he sacrificed himself to
save my life at the end.

326
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,589
Back during the Second Impact.

327
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:27,407
Then, I didn't know whether I hated him
or loved him.

328
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,781
The only thing that was clear to me

329
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,651
was l wanted to destroy the Angels
who caused the Second Impact.

330
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,352
So in order to do that, I joined Nerv.

331
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:40,024
In the end, maybe I just want to
get revenge on my father,

332
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,495
so that I can free myself of him.

333
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:46,246
I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away.
I mustn't run away.

334
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:48,433
Right.

335
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,178
I must not run away.

336
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,204
Target has been sighted
at maximum magnification.

337
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,307
Distance is approximately 25,000.

338
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:56,568
Here it comes.

339
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,152
All Evas, start positions.

340
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:10,255
All we have is a rough estimated trajectory
from optical sightings.

341
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,558
So the Magi will guide you until
the distance is 10,000 meters.

342
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,328
After that, use your own judgment.

343
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,863

Angel approaching, approximate

348
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,264
Commence operation.

349
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:24,760
Here we go.

350
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:28,924
Start!

351
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,357

Now!

356
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,666
Bastard!

357
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:08,306
Our wireless communications
have been restored.

358
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,267
We're receiving a message from
Commander Ikari at the South Pole.

359
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:12,644
Connect him here.

360
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:13,465
Yes, Ma'am.

361
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,181
I'm very sorry, Sir.

362
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:19,918
My selfish decision has caused
Unit 01 to incur damage.

363
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,969
The responsibility is entirely mine.

364
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:26,224
That is not a problem.
Destroying Angels is the Evas' purpose.

365
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,993
In fact, we are fortunate to have sustained
such minimal damage.

366
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:32,063
Yes, excellent work, Major Katsuragi.

367
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,331
Thank you, Sir.

368
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,472
By the way, is the pilot of Unit 01 there?

369
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:37,936
Yes, Sir!

370
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:40,716
I've received the report. Good work, Shinji.

371
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:44,476
Yes, Sir.

372
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:47,412
Now, Major Katsuragi, I'll leave
the rest in your hands.

373
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,480
Yes, Sir.

374

The exit will switch to the left side
at the next station.

378
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:04,963
Now you're going to have to keep your promise.

379
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:06,331
Of coursel!

380
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:09,834
I withdrew a fortune, so I can even handle
a full-course dinner.

381
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,125
Though it's before payday...

382
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:13,661
Ramen

383
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:17,108
We know the state of your wallet.

384
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,399
You can take it easy.

385
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:22,147
And Miss Perfect said she'd join us
if it was for ramen noodles.

386
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:24,449
Il have a garlic ramen with no roast pork.

387
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,751
I'll have shark fin with roast pork. Large!

388
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,682
There you go, one shark fin with roast pork!

389
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,990
Say, Miss Misato?

390
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:33,324
What?

391
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:36,828
When I heard my father's words earlier,

392
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:40,229
I think I finally understood what it's like
to feel happy when you're praised.

393
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,803
And I also realized

394
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:49,604
that maybe I pilot the Eva because I wanted
to hear those words from him.

395
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:53,663
You're piloting for something like that?

396
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,150
You really are stupid.

397
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,603

the underground faciities are corrupted
one after another,

401
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,672
and finally Nerv is confronted with making
the decision to self-destruct.
