1
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:06,401
Just like the cruel angel

2
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:14,081
Young boy, become a legend

3
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,190
Even though the untested breeze
taps at the door to your heart

4
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:36,490
You just look solely at me and smile

5
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:42,971
So intent on seeking out that gentle touch

6
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:50,982
Such innocent eyes, still ignorant
of their destiny

7
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:57,989
But someday, you are sure to realize
that upon your back

8
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:05,907
You have the wings with which to fly
towards the distant future

9
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:11,103
The cruel angel's thesis

10
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:14,839
Soon, you will take flight from the windowsill

11
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:18,610
With your torrent of ardent pathos

12
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:22,315
If you are to betray our memories

13
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:25,952
You, who embrace these heavens and shine

14
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:29,233
Young boy, become a legend

15
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:33,292
This is Ekta 64 calling Neopan 400,

Ekta 64, roger that.
This is Ekta 64, roger and out.

This is Ekta 64, roger and out.

35
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:57,949
Where's Asuka?

36
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,821
She's already left. It would seem that
she's determined not to see me.

37
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,523
Why?

38
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:07,104
Shinji, I guess you're still too young
to understand a woman's feelings.

39
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,263
Well...
By the way...

40
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,866
Go ahead.

41
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:17,436
Is the rumor that Unit 04 went missing true?

42
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:20,206
I heard that there was some kind
of accident, and it exploded.

43
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,441
Yes, it's true.

44
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:26,178
Unit 04 vanished, along with
the Second Branch of Nerv.

45
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,948
It happened while they were
testing the S2 engine.

46
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,616
But don't worry, we'll be all right here.

47
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,785
All three of our Evas are functioning properly.

48
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:35,186
And we have a crack team of pilots and staff.

49
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:38,156
But I heard that Unit 03 is being
brought here from America.

50
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,088
You're performing the activation tests
at Matsushiro, aren't you?

51
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,329
I'll be out for four days or so,

52
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,165
but Kaji will be taking care of you two,
so don't worry.

53
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,500
But what about the test?

54
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,035
Ritsuko will be there as well, after all.

55
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,569
There won't be any problems.

56
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,799
But what about the pilot?

57
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,410
Well, about the pilot...

58
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,283
Yes?

59
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,334
Good morning!

60
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,983
I've come today with a request, Major Katsuragi!

61
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:13,676
Please! Make me the pilot
for Evangelion Unit 03!

62
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:18,342
Selection
of Life
Episode
Eighteen

63
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,904
So, Shinji doesn't know yet?

64
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:27,807
Finding the right time to tell him...

65
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,141
I'm scared.

66
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:32,344
Sometimes I just can't tell
what the heck he's thinking.

67
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,013
Pull yourself together.

68
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,448
You're the one who volunteered
to be his guardian.

69
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,051
I know, but...

70
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,387
So when are you calling in the pilot?

71
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:44,698
I think that'll be tomorrow.
There are a lot of things to prep, after all.

72
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,828
He might tell Shinji himself.

73
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,463
I don't think so.

74
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:53,466
He wasn't enthused enough
to be bragging about it.

75
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:57,303
Getting his sister transferred to
our hospital here at Headquarters

76
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,144
was the one condition he gave.

77
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,375
Man, Miss Misato sure can be cold.

78
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,578
I'm number one when it comes to enthusiasm,

79
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,147
so she could at least use me,
even if it's just as a backup.

80
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:09,378
Right, Toji?

81
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:19,658
What happened? You left before me,
but you're awfully late.

82
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:22,269
What, no marital spat today?

83
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,333
I just didn't want to see your ugly faces!

84
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,944
You three damn stooges!

85
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,777
Now, time to eat!

86
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,712
Hey, where's Toji?

87
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:40,563
He's gone.

88
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,404
Without even eating lunch? Him?

89
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,521
That's impossible.

90
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,830
He's been acting odd lately, hasn't he?

91
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:55,451
Suzuhara...

92
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,989
Oh, Ayanami, if you're lookin' for Shinji,
he ain't here.

93
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:05,004
You know 'bout me, don't you?

94
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,405
Seems Sohryu knows too.

95
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,012
So Shinji's the only one who doesn't know.

96
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,339
You don't usually care 'bout people.

97
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,117
Really? I'm not sure I understand.

98
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:20,452
The one you care about's Shiniji.

99
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,743
Do I?

100
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,390
You may be right.

101
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:25,681
Yeah, you do.

102
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,729
Hikari!

103
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,960
Let's have lunch!

104
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:37,069
Two hours late, and then, finally, he arrives.

105
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,439
He's the first guy to ever make me
wait this long.

106
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,960
Yeah, because you never waited for the guy
when you were dating, right?

107
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:49,315
And so this was the so-called Second Impact.

108
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:52,585
At that time I was living in a place
called Nebukawa,

109
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:56,555
but the rising water levels caused
by the melting of Antarctica

110
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,075
have submerged it beneath the sea.

111
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,159
Sorry, transfer student,
but I've gotta beat you up!

112
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,548
I won't feel right until I've smacked you.

113
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,180
I'm sorry, Asuka. You always
walk home with Ikari.

114
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:24,316
Forget it. The only reason I'm with Shiniji
is because of work.

115
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,507
And I don't feel like seeing him today anyway.

116
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,625
This is about Suzuhara, isn't it?

117
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:34,293
Yes. You could tell?

118
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:35,628
It's obvious.

119
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:38,631
The three stooges are about
the only ones who don't see it.

120
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:41,000
But Ikari seems naive.

121
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,035
Actually, he's the most dense of them all.

122
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,570
And he's an idiot to boot.

123
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,351
He doesn't know how to relate to people.

124
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,430
Really?

125
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:56,916
I think Suzuhara might like Miss Ayanami.

126
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:00,419
Suzuhara does?! Miss Perfect?!

127
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,055
They seemed to be getting along during lunch.

128
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,925
Don't worry, Hikari. There's no way.

129
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:09,762
She's a million times denser than Shinji is
about relating to people!

130
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:10,930
Really?

131
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:11,781
Really!

132
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,602
Can I ask you one thing?

133
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,670
What?

134
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:19,861
What do you see in that hot-headed stooge?

135
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:24,866
His kindness...

136
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,955
Ultimately, getting back together with you that
time was where all the mistakes began.

137
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,423
How can you say that now?

138
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:38,390
Come to think of it...
I can still change my life.

139
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,191
Kaji sure spends a lot of time in the tub.
I can still change my life.

140
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,326
Kaji sure spends a lot of time in the tub.
There are lots of pitfalls in life,

141
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:41,660
There are lots of pitfalls in life,

142
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,362
but even if you fall in, you can just
crawl your way out of it again.

143
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:44,263
I wonder who's going to pilot Unit 03?
but even if you fall in, you can just
crawl your way out of it again.

144
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:45,631
I wonder who's going to pilot Unit 03?
And I'm the pitfall?

145
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:45,864
I wonder who's going to pilot Unit 03?
I don't have to live in sorrow.

146
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:46,665
I don't have to live in sorrow.

147
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,067
You mean you haven't heard yet?
I don't have to live in sorrow.

148
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:48,367
You mean you haven't heard yet?
But after despair, hope is always waiting for you.

149
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:49,301
Who is it?
But after despair, hope is always waiting for you.

150
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,136
But after despair, hope is always waiting for you.

151
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,439
And I'm the pronoun for your despair?

152
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:53,572
Yes, the only reason I came back
was so we could break up again.

153
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:54,707
I don't know.
Yes, the only reason I came back
was so we could break up again.

154
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,008
Yes, the only reason I came back
was so we could break up again.

155
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:56,075
This is too mean.

156
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,409
That was refreshing!
This is too mean.

157
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,110
Now that I consider it, a man who sucks
at kissing never works out!

158
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,945
What? Are you two fighting again?
Now that I consider it, a man who sucks
at kissing never works out!

159
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:00,546
What? Are you two fighting again?
My kissing sucks?

160
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:00,779
You guys are hopeless.
My kissing sucks?

161
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,747
You guys are hopeless.
Not just your kissing!

162
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:02,514
Are you two always like this
when Katsuragi's gone?
Not just your kissing!

163
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:03,649
Are you two always like this
when Katsuragi's gone?
Not just my kissing?!

164
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:03,716
Are you two always like this
when Katsuragi's gone?
I knew it!

165
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:04,950
No!
I knew it!

166
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:05,017
I get to spend the night with you, after all,
so I'd love to be all happy and smiling.
I knew it!

167
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:09,254
I get to spend the night with you, after all,
so I'd love to be all happy and smiling.
Why did I repeat the same mistake?

168
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,055
Why did I repeat the same mistake?

169
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:10,489
But I can't do it tonight. I just can't.
Why did I repeat the same mistake?

170
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,925
But I can't do it tonight. I just can't.
Yes, this mistake must be corrected!

171
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:13,559
Yes, this mistake must be corrected!

172
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,961
I must start a new life free of regret!

173
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:16,362
I understand. Let's go to bed.
I must start a new life free of regret!

174
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:17,830
I understand. Let's go to bed.
Before you do that,

175
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,630
I understand. Let's go to bed.
why don't you put your clothes on
and make the bed?

176
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,030
Going to bed early is the best thing
for these situations.
why don't you put your clothes on
and make the bed?

177
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:30,909
Are you asleep yet, Kaji?

178
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,640
No, not yet.

179
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,248
What's my father like?

180
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,317
Well, that came out of nowhere.

181
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,819
I thought you'd ask about Katsuragi.

182
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,930
Because it seems like you're
always with my father.

183
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,291
It's the Vice Commander who's always with him.

184
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,602
Have you been asking around
about your father?

185
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,931
Because I haven't been around him much.

186
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,222
So you don't really know him?

187
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:58,321
But I've learned a lot about him lately.

188
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:03,642
About his work, about my mother, so...

189
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,683
You're wrong there. You only
believe that you've learned.

190
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:10,516
People can't understand others completely.

191
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,885
Who knows if you can even
understand yourself?

192
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,106
Understanding each other one hundred percent
is impossible.

193
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:20,726
Of course, that's why we spend so much time
trying to understand ourselves and others.

194
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,595
That's what makes life so interesting.

195
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,496
Is that also true for you and Miss Misato?

196
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:30,235
The word we use for "she" literally
means "the woman far away".

197
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:34,206
To us, women will always be
on the distant shore.

198
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:38,977
Basically, there's a river dividing men and
women, deeper and wider than the ocean.

199
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,027
I don't understand adults.

200
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:45,699
T minus 300 minutes to Unit 03 activation test.

201
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:47,453

209
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:53,492

On Board Central General Command Vehicle
No problems detected in
the data link to Unit O1.

216
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,899
No problems detected in
the data link to Unit O1.

217
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,235
It could even go into combat as is.

218
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,876
Really? That's nice.

219
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,139
Now that was a half-hearted reply.

220
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,410
You know, once this unit is cleared for duty,
it'll be assigned directly under your command.

221
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:13,251
The exclusive control of four Evas...

222
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,687
If you wanted to, you could destroy the world.

223
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,419
Have you told Shinji yet?

224
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,939
I will when the test is over.

225
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,124
The Fourth Child has arrived.

226
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,875
Second squad, begin readying
the entry vehicle immediately.

227
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,337
He's not here yet, is he, Asuka?

228
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,393
He may not be coming today.

229
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,935
I thought we might finally eat together today...

230
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:41,695
Do you want this?

231
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:46,578
Unit 03's already in Japan, isn't it?

232
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,815
Yeah, I think it got here yesterday.

233
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,596
Must be nice. I wonder who's going to pilot it?

234
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:57,556
Maybe it's Toji? He's absent today, after all.

235
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:58,847
No way!

236
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,995
Entry plug fixed in place.

237
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,863
Initiating first connection.

238
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,165
Transmitting pulse.

239
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,533
Graph readout is normal.

240
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,768
Checklist cleared up to 1350.

241
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,537
No problems found in initial contact phase.

242
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:14,439
Roger. Shift the operation to phase two.

243
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,241
All nerve links are normal.

244
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,243
Checklist cleared up to 2550.

245
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,679
All harmonics are normal.

246
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,550
We are now exceeding the absolute border.

247
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,292
Abort the test! Break the circuit!

248
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:32,324
No good! High energy readings
detected in body!

249
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:33,615
Impossible!

250
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,218
An Angel?!

251
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,950
An explosion has occurred in Matsushiro.

252
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,251
Damage level unknown.

253
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:02,120
Send the rescue squad and the Third Troop.

254
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,656
Take care of it before the SSDF gets involved.

255
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:05,490
Roger.

256
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,893
Movement of an unidentified object
detected at the site.

257
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,996
Pattern is orange. We can't
confirm it to be an Angel.

258
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:13,398
Go to battle stations, Level One.

259
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,567
All personnel, battle stations, Level One.

260
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,502
Prepare for ground combat.

261
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,104
Launch all Eva units!

262
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,139
Dispatch immediately to intercept locations.

263
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,010
Air transport is scheduled to go in twenty.

264
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,750
An accident in Matsushiro?!

265
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,180
No way! Then, are Miss Misato
and the others okay?!

266
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,388
We can't contact them yet.

267
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,690
No way. What will we do?

268
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,859
What are you blubbering about?!

269
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,162
Worrying about them right now
won't get us anywhere!

270
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,123
But how can we fight the Angel by ourselves?

271
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:50,569
Commander lkari is taking direct command now.

272
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,137
My father is?

273
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,948
We have a visual of the target at Mt. Nobe.
Transferring to main monitor.

274
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,982
As I thought...

275
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,184
Transmit the abort signal.

276
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,795
Force eject the entry plug.

277
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:14,293
Not working. Neither abort signal
nor plug ejection code accepted.

278
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,460
What about the pilot?

279
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,211
We still have respiratory and cardiac
response, but he's probably...

280
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,934
Evangelion Unit 03 will be
abandoned at this time.

281
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:26,138
It will be designated as the Thirteenth Angel.

282
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,372
But, Sir!

283
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:30,075
Deploy the battle line at Mt. Nobe as planned.

284
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:31,366
Destroy the target.

285
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,069
Target is approaching.

286
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,915
All units prepare for ground combat.

287
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,485
No way!

288
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,854
An Angel? Is that an Angel?!

289
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,695
Correct, that is the target.

290
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,093
You said that this is the target,

291
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,384
but it's an Eva, isn't it?!

292
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,864
But that's...

293
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,100
How could it have been taken over by an Angel?

294
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:59,638
I wonder if it's piloted by a human too?
A child our age?

295
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,039
You still don't know?! The pilot of Unit 03 is...

296
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,065
Asuka?

297
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,449
Asuka?!

298
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,090
Eva Unit 02 has gone silent!

299
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:20,425
The pilot has ejected. Recovery squad
is heading for retrieval.

300
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:21,946
Target is moving towards Unit 00!

301
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,465
Rei, avoid close range combat
and stop the target.

302
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:27,866
I'm sending Unit 01 over now.

303
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,156
Roger.

304
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,001
He's in there.

305
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,505
The Angel is invading Unit 00's left arm.

306
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:07,906
The nerve systems are being corrupted.

307
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,709
Sever the left arm. Quickly!

308
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,211
But if we don't cut the neural connections first...

309
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,980
Sever it.

310
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,271
Yes, Sir.

311
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:35,000
Unit 00 is severely damaged.
The pilot is wounded.

312
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,067
No way...

313
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,402
The target is approaching you.

314
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,739
It will contact you in twenty.
You must destroy it.

315
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,760
But this target is...

316
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,687
Isn't there a person in there?

317
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,267
Another child my own age.

318
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:19,878
An entry plug!

319
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,839
There is a person in there, just as I thought.

320
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,530
Problems in life support!

321
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,933
The pilot's in danger!

322
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,936
Not good! Cut the synch rate to 60%!

323
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:45,804
Wait!

324
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:46,505
But lkari, at this rate, the pilot will die.
Wait!

325
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,773
But lkari, at this rate, the pilot will die.

326
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,176
Shinji, why don't you fight?

327
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,479
But there's a person in there, Father!

328
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,582
Irrelevant! It is an Angel! Our enemy!

329
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,151
But... but I can't!

330
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:03,321
I've got to save them! I can't just kill somebody!

331
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,689
You'll die.

332
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,940
I don't care! It's better than killing someone!

333
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,531
Never mind! Cut all synchronization
between the pilot and Unit O1.

334
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,665
Cut it?

335
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,902
Correct. Switch the control circuit
to the dummy plug.

336
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:20,105
But the dummy system still has
a lot of problems,

337
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,173
and without Dr. Akagi's approval...

338
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:25,610
1t'll be of more use than the pilot. Do it!

339
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:26,901
Yes, Sir.

340
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:39,047
What is this?

341
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,894
What did you do, Father?!

342
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,963
Reception of the signal, confirmed.

343
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:47,265
Control system switch is complete.

344
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:50,135
All nerves linked directly to the dummy system.

345
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:54,439
32.8% of Emotional Elements are unclear.
They can't be monitored.

346
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,280
Irrelevant. Release the system.
Commence attack.

347
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:21,933
This is the power of the dummy plug?

348
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,468
System status nominal.

349
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,759
Gain still increasing.

350
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,178
Stop it!

351
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,702
Father, stop! Stop doing this!

352
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,231
Damn! Stop!

353
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:30,101
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

354
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,101
Stop!

355
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,741
STOP!

356
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:56,182
Eva Unit 03, no, I mean,

357
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,469
the target is completely silent.

358
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:06,932
Lemon Glaf
Lunches

359
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,207
I'll make this.

360
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:13,048
Kodama, Nozomi, and I...
This recipe is for four.

361
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,343
I wonder if he'll eat it tomorrow?

362
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,083
We've found a survivor over here too!
He's still breathing!

363
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:20,452
Third squad, erase 807 data
as soon as possible.
We've found a survivor over here too!
He's still breathing!

364
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:22,062
Third squad, erase 807 data
as soon as possible.
Send help right away!

365
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,026
Second squad, please hurry and check
for survivors in the linear block.

366
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:28,927
Am I still alive?
Second squad, please hurry and check
for survivors in the linear block.

367
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:29,128
Am I still alive?

368
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,464
Kaji?

369
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:34,334
You were lucky, Katsuragi.

370
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:38,570
Where's Ritsuko?

371
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,205
Don't worry.

372
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,696
She wasn't hurt as bad as you.

373
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:43,358
I see.

374
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:45,944
What about Eva Unit 03?

375
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:48,985
It was apparently destroyed,
as an Angel, by Unit O1.

376
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:58,834
I... I haven't told Shinji anything.

377
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,200
Shinji...

378
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:12,070
Miss Misato, so you're all right?

379
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:13,872
l...

380
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,473
I'm sorry.

381
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:20,474
I had something important to tell you, but...

382
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:23,016
Miss Misato, I...

383
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,509
I killed...

384
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:28,052
It was my father...

385
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:29,953
I begged him to stop, but...

386
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,859
Shinji, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

387
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,995
Report from the entry plug recovery team.

388
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:39,130
The pilot's life signs are confirmed.

389
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,598
He's alive?!

390
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,349
Unit 03's pilot is...

391
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:46,934
The Fourth Child is...

392
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,330
Toji?

393
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:51,399
Shinji?

394
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,945
Shinji?

395
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:55,814
Shinji?!

396
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,348
Shinji?!

397
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,249
Shinji?!

398
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:58,550
To Be Continued
Shinji?!

399
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,571
To Be Continued

Preview

401
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:11,055
Shiniji finally, of his own will,
quits as an Eva pilot.

402
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:16,056
But regardless of his decision, the strongest of
the Angels attacks, giving rise to a new tragedy.

403
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,859
Next time: "A Man's Battle"

404
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,095
Next Time
A Man’s Battle
