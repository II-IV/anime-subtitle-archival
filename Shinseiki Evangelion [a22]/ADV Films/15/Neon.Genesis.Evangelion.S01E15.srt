1
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:06,401
Just like the cruel angel

2
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:14,081
Young boy, become a legend

3
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,190
Even though the untested breeze
taps at the door to your heart

4
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:36,490
You just look solely at me and smile

5
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:42,971
So intent on seeking out that gentle touch

6
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:50,982
Such innocent eyes, still ignorant
of their destiny

7
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:57,989
But someday, you are sure to realize
that upon your back

8
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:05,907
You have the wings with which to fly
towards the distant future

9
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:11,103
The cruel angel's thesis

10
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:14,839
Soon, you will take flight from the windowsill

11
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:18,610
With your torrent of ardent pathos

12
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:22,315
If you are to betray our memories

13
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:25,952
You, who embrace these heavens and shine

14
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:29,233
Young boy, become a legend

15
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,729
The second and third Ashino Lakes,

16
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:40,071
I hope there won't be any more of those.

17
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:44,804
I received a complaint from
Chairman Kiel about the delay.

18
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,095
It came directly to me.

19
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:51,207
He was pretty upset.
He even hinted at dismissing you.

20
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,280
Adam is proceeding well,

21
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,651
and the Eva Project has begun work
on the dummy plugs.

22
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:00,286
What do the old men of Seele
have to complain about?

23
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,127
The all-important Human Instrumentality Project
is behind schedule.

24
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:07,792
All the projects are linked.
There are no problems.

25
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,084
Including Rei?

26
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,921
Well, never mind.

27
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,966
By the way, what should we do about that man?

28
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:18,638
We'll leave him to his own devices.
The same with the Marduk Institute.

29
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,979
I suppose we'll let him work to our purposes
for a while longer.

30
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,779
Kyoto

31
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,847
What started here, sixteen years ago?

32
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:28,881
Stop
What started here, sixteen years ago?

33
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,252
Stop

34
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,875
Episode Fifteen
Lies and Silence

35
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,641
It's me.

36
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:55,898
Yes, so it is.

37
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,700
Shannon Bio, a chemical firm
funded from overseas.

38
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,767
It's been here for nine years,
but it also hasn't changed in nine years.

39
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:09,555
The Marduk Institute has
108 affiliated companies.

40
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,724
106 of them turned out to be
dummy corporations.

41
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,655
And this is the 107th?

42
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,529
This is the corporate registration.

43
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,460
You want me to take a look
at the board of directors, right?

44
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:19,565
Gendo Ikari
Kouzou Fuyutsuki
Kiel Lorenz

45
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,033
Gendo Ikari
Kouzou Fuyutsuki
Kiel Lorenz
So you already knew about it?

46
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,468
Gendo Ikari
Kouzou Fuyutsuki
Kiel Lorenz
The names are all familiar.

47
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:23,069
The names are all familiar.

48
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:27,873
The Marduk Institute is supposed to be
an advisory body

49
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,109
controlled by the Human Instrumentality
Committee to select Eva pilots.

50
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,379
What it really does is not clear.

51
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,248
Your duty is to investigate Nerv.

52
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,650
Getting involved in the Marduk Institute
is a bad idea.

53
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:43,372
Well, I'm the type that has to see
everything for myself.

54
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,169
Hi, this is Kaji. I'm out right now.

55
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,112
Please leave your name and message.

56
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:57,474
Help me, Mr. Kaji! Don't touch me, you pervert!

57
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,207
Not.

58
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,975
What's going on?

59
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,436
Well, tomorrow's Sunday.

60
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:10,315
So I called Mr. Kaji, thinking that I'd get him
to take me out somewhere, but he's not in.

61
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:14,353
He's always out lately, no matter when I call.

62
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,084
That means you're free tomorrow, right?

63
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,667
Regrettably, yes.

64
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,916
Then I have a little favor to ask of you.

65
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,186
Well, it's like this...

66
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,701
What?! A date?!

67
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:30,836
A friend of my big sister Kodama

68
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,207
is insisting that I introduce you to him.

69
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,397
Pleasel

70
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:48,481
Head!

71
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:50,689
Get to it!

72
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,590
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,826
YOU need to get to it and clean!

74
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,761
Necrosis operation complete.

75
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,563
Graph measurement complete.

76
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,665
What are you going to wear tomorrow?
Synch rate is normal.

77
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,767
Oh, to the wedding?

78
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,870
I wore the pink suit for Kiyomi's wedding,

79
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,907
and the dark blue dress for Kotoko's
just the other day.

80
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:09,074
What about the orange one?

81
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,576
You haven't worn that one lately, have you?

82
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:13,846
Well, there's a reason for that.

83
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:15,147
It's too tight?

84
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,438
Yeah, so what?!

85
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,181
Should I get a new one on the way home?

86
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,584
It's an extra expense.

87
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:27,159
We've been invited to so many weddings lately,
the cost of all the gifts is starting to add up.

88
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,096
Everyone's just rushing to get married
before they're thirty.

89
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,727
No one wants to be the last one still single.

90
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,236
That's enough, you three.

91
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:38,527
Good work.

92
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,585
All these stupid tests are boring!

93
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:48,541
By the way, Shinji looks even more
downcast than usual today.

94
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,206
That's because of tomorrow.

95
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,854
Yes, tomorrow.

96
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,785
Tomorrow, I have to see my father.

97
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,728
What should [ talk to him about?

98
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,297
Why do you ask me?

99
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:08,808
Because I once saw you
talking happily with him.

100
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,275
Say, what kind of person is my father?

101
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:18,901
I don't know.

102
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:22,548
I see.

103
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,539
You've been looking at me all afternoon
because you wanted to ask me that?

104
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:32,725
When we were cleaning today,
you were wringing out the cloth, remember?

105
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,916
The way you did it was like a mother.

106
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:37,286
A mother?

107
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:43,526
I thought it was like a mother.

108
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:48,207
Maybe you'd be really good
at being a housewife, Ayanami.

109
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,368
What are you saying?!

110
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,050
What do you mean? You're the one
that wanted to break up!

111
00:06:58,051 --> 00:06:59,618
I'm home.
What do you mean? You're the one
that wanted to break up!

112
00:06:59,619 --> 00:06:59,919
Welcome back.

113
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,986
Welcome back.
I was wrong. I wasn't thinking back then.

114
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:04,223
You'd better go to bed.
Aren't you going on a date tomorrow?
I was wrong. I wasn't thinking back then.

115
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:04,290
You'd better go to bed.
Aren't you going on a date tomorrow?
What are you saying at this late date?

116
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,958
Yeah, with a hunk.
What are you saying at this late date?

117
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:06,358
What are you saying at this late date?

118
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,326
I don't know about you,
but I'm a different person now!

119
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:10,129
Hey, that's right, let me use
your lavender perfume!
I don't know about you,
but I'm a different person now!

120
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:10,696
Hey, that's right, let me use
your lavender perfume!
But I still love you!

121
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:11,697
Absolutely not.
But I still love you!

122
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:12,665
Jeez, cheapskate!
But I still love you!

123
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,699
Jeez, cheapskate!
Time and people are two things that can't be
turned back to the way they were!

124
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,968
It's not for kids.
Time and people are two things that can't be
turned back to the way they were!

125
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:16,135
Is Shinji in his room?
Time and people are two things that can't be
turned back to the way they were!

126
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:17,069
Is Shinji in his room?
I can never go back to the way I was!

127
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,537
He's been in there since he got back.
I can never go back to the way I was!

128
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:18,704
He's been in there since he got back.
But I really do still love you!

129
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,372
It looks like he doesn't want to see his father.
But I really do still love you!

130
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:20,739
It looks like he doesn't want to see his father.
I'm telling you, it's impossible!

131
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,541
If he doesn't want to, he should just say so.
I'm telling you, it's impossible!

132
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:22,875
I don't understand the Japanese.
I'm telling you, it's impossible!

133
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,710
I don't understand the Japanese.
It took me three years to forget you! It's too late!

134
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,779
Well, it's not that he doesn't want to.
It took me three years to forget you! It's too late!

135
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,479
It took me three years to forget you! It's too late!

136
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,280
That's the problem.
It took me three years to forget you! It's too late!

137
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,211
That's the problem.

138
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,188
Leave!

139
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,496
Well done, Shiniji.

140
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,633
Shinji?

141
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,924
I'm opening the door.

142
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,723
Are you scared? Of seeing
your father by yourself?

143
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,712
You can't keep running away.

144
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,323
Unless you take that step forward,
nothing will change.

145
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,690
I know that!

146
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,519
You'll begin to realize,

147
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,620
after that first step, it's just as important
to keep going.

148
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,995
Anyway, go see him tomorrow
with your chin held high,

149
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,366
because you'll be seeing your mother too.

150
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:19,668
Well, good night.

151
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,707
Hey, you bought a new dress for tomorrow,
didn't you? Let me see!

152
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,043
Oh, you want to see?
It was expensive, you know.

153
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:32,611
Taste is more important than price.

154
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:34,279
I've got that down pat.

155
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,150
Did you pick based on Mr. Kaji's
taste and stuff after all?

156
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,918
I think not. Not anymore.

157
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:39,985
Next Day
I think not. Not anymore.

158
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,356
Next Day

159
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:42,388
Well!

160
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:42,988
See you...

161
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:43,809
Later.

162
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,498
Place three bags in your heart...

163
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:55,667
Red, blue, and yellow...

164
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,803
Now let us proceed with the reception.

165
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:58,070
Mr. Ryoji Kaji
Now let us proceed with the reception.

166
00:08:58,071 --> 00:08:58,621
Mr. Ryoji Kaji

167
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:01,974
Ryo's late.

168
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:05,844
That idiot has never been on time
in his entire life!

169
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:09,114
For your dates, you mean?
He's always on time for work.

170
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:12,045
Hey, you two! You look
even more beautiful today.

171
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:15,187
I couldn't get off work in time.

172
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:17,497
As if you're not puttering
around the office all the time.

173
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,693
Not that I care, but couldn't you have done
something about that stubble?

174
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,184
Look, your necktie is crooked.

175
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,998
Well, thank you.

176
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,519
You two act like you're married.

177
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,035
Sounds good to me, Ritchan.

178
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,345
Like hell I'd take him.

179
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:49,065
It's been three years since the last time
we came here together.

180
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:52,423
I ran away then,

181
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,327
and haven't been back since.

182
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:58,898
It just hasn't sunk in that Mother is resting here.

183
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,467
I don't even remember her face.

184
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:04,536
Man survives by forgetting his memories,

185
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,539
but there are some things
a man should never forget.

186
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,009
Yui taught me about the irreplaceable things.

187
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,790
I come here to confirm that.

188
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,783
You have no pictures of her?

189
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,284
There are none left.

190
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,254
This grave is just a decoration too.
There's no corpse.

191
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:26,358
So, the teacher was right.
You threw them all away.

192
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,969
I keep everything in my heart.
That is enough for now.

193
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:34,675
It's time. I'm leaving now.

194
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:43,882
Father!

195
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:49,595
Um, I'm glad I got to talk to you today.

196
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,146
I see.

197
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,232
Not bad! I didn't know you played.

198
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:43,702
I've been studying since I was five,
and this is all I can do,

199
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,404
so l don't really have any talent.

200
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:48,607
Perseverance is power. I'm a little impressed.

201
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,876
I started studying because
my teacher told me to,

202
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,511
so I could have quit anytime.

203
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,947
Then why did you keep going?

204
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:57,182
Because nobody told me to stop.

205
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,318
I should have known!

206
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:02,988
You came back early.
I thought you'd have dinner too.

207
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,157
He was just so boring!

208
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:09,695
So, while he was waiting in line
for the roller coaster, [ left.

209
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,530
That doesn't seem too nice.

210
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:14,570
Really, Mr. Kaji is the only real man around.

211
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,204
What're you saying after all this time?

212
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,440
I'm ducking out to the restroom.

213
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:22,781
Don't ditch me now!

214
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,215
High heels...

215
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,285
How many years has it been since
the three of us last drank together?

216
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,053
Isn't Misato drinking too much?

217
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,222
She's acting a little giddy.

218
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,063
And you drink some more to
keep your high spirits in check.

219
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,961
Or vice versa, today.

220
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:46,122
As someone who lived with her,
your words carry the weight of truth.

221
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,800
Well, I did live with her,

222
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,737
but that was before she started
wearing heels and things.

223
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:54,773
It was unimaginable when
we were back in school.

224
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,675
I was a brat too.

225
00:12:56,676 --> 00:13:01,580
That wasn't really sharing a life.
It was just living together, playing house.

226
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,682
Reality isn't that easy.

227
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:06,184
Oh yeah, here. A cat souvenir.

228
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,487
My, thank you. You're very thorough.

229
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:11,089
Only with the ladies.
When it comes to work, I'm sloppy.

230
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,991
I somehow doubt that.

231
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,226
What about for Misato?

232
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:15,927
I lost once before.

233
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,063
I make a point of not fighting
when  can't win the battle.

234
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,898
I think you have a chance at victory.

235
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,099
What about you?

236
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,535
I make a point of not talking about myself,

237
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:24,845
because it's no fun.

238
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,728
Katsuragi's sure taking a long time.
Maybe she's fixing her make-up?

239
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,544
What were you doing in Kyoto?

240
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,980
Huh? That's from Matsushiro.

241
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,415
It's no use playing dumb.

242
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,184
Your fingers will get burned if you
get involved in this too deeply.

243
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,787
That's the advice of a friend.

244
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,522
I'll take it seriously,

245
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,757
but if I have to get burned, I'd rather be burned
while playing with fire along with you.

246
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:46,758
Shall I go buy you some fireworks?
but if I have to get burned, I'd rather be burned
while playing with fire along with you.

247
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,060
Shall I go buy you some fireworks?

248
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,061
Welcome back!

249
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:51,463
You haven't changed, have you, you player?

250
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:55,567
Of course I've changed. To live is to change.

251
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,203
Homeostasis and transistasis.

252
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,204
What are those?

253
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:02,307
One is a force for the status quo,
and the other's a force for change.

254
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:06,545
A living thing is something that has
both of these conflicting qualities.

255
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,066
Like men and women.

256
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,883
Well, I'll be leaving now.
I've still got some work to do.

257
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,085
Really?

258
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,319
Sorry to hear it.

259
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,610
Later.

260
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:26,365
Hey, Shin? It's me.

261
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:30,402
I'm drinking with Kaji right now.
Right, we're on the third after-party.

262
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:33,572
Yes... Okay, later.

263
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:34,573
Was it Misato?

264
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:37,609
Yes, she said she'll be late,
so don't wait up for her.

265
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,645
What? Don't tell me she's coming back
in the morning!

266
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,248
No way, she's with Mr. Kaji.

267
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,029
What are you, stupid? That's WHY!

268
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,859
You shouldn't be throwing up at your age.

269
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,695
So sorry I'm that age.

270
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:58,296
I guess we're both that age.

271
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,798
Damn right.

272
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,701
You're wearing heels now, after all.

273
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,222
Time's really flown.

274
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,244
Shave that stubble off.

275
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:09,194
Yes, Ma'am.

276
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:11,846
I'll walk the rest of the way. Thanks.

277
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,803
Kaji, do you think I've changed?

278
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,444
You've become more beautiful.

279
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:28,360
I'm sorry that I insisted on
breaking up with you.

280
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:31,296
When [ said I fell in love with somebody else,

281
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,698
that was a lie. Did you know?

282
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:34,988
No.

283
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,571
It's just that I realized

284
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:42,122
you were like my father.

285
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:50,378
That I wanted a man like my father...

286
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,240
When I realized that, I was afraid.

287
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,823
 was desperately afraid.

288
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,424
Of being with you, Kaji...

289
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,793
Of being a woman...

290
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,074
I was afraid of everything.

291
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:09,108
I hated my father, but fell in love
with someone just like him.

292
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,165
I chose Nerv, intending to
make a clean break with the past.

293
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,209
But even that was an organization
that Father used to belong to.

294
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:21,020
In the end, I've been fooling myself
by taking revenge against the Angels.

295
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,688
That was your decision, Katsuragi.

296
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,790
You don't have to apologize to me.

297
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,593
No, that wasn't a decision!

298
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,962
I was just running away.

299
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:39,764
Running away from the snare of my father!

300
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,300
I'm just like Shiniji.

301
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,591
I'm a coward.

302
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:48,907
I'm really sorry. Telling you all this now
because I drank too much...

303
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:49,875
That's enough.

304
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,643
I'm such a child.

305
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:53,979
I have no right to tell Shinji anything.

306
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,980
That's enough!

307
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:59,981
On top of that, I'm an underhanded woman
that just clings to men when it suits me!

308
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:03,321
Even back then, I may have just been using you!

309
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,122
I hate myself!

310
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:04,823
That's enough! Stop it!
I hate myself!

311
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:05,423
That's enough! Stop it!

312
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:05,624
That's enough! Stop it!
I'm so pathetic!

313
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,325
I'm so pathetic!

314
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,916
Hey, Shinji, do you want to kiss?

315
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:34,886
What?

316
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,887
What?
A kiss. A kiss? You've never kissed, right?

317
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,467
A kiss. A kiss? You've never kissed, right?

318
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,159
Then, let's do it.

319
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,960
Why?

320
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:42,661
Because I'm bored.
Why?

321
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:43,461
Because I'm bored.

322
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:46,298
Because you're bored?! But...

323
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:49,768
You don't want to kiss a girl on
the anniversary of your mom's death?

324
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:52,437
Afraid she may be watching you from Heaven?

325
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,171
Not really.

326
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:53,939
Or are you scared?
Not really.

327
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,506
Or are you scared?

328
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:56,741
I'm not scared of a little kiss!

329
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,382
You brushed your teeth, didn't you?

330
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,101
Then, here I go.

331
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,020
Don't breathe, because it tickles.

332
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,662
Definitely not something to do to kill time!

333
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,018
All right, here we are. Hang on.

334
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:11,883
Mr. Kaji!

335
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:12,964
What?!

336
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,420
Mr. Kaji!

337
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:21,026
Well, I'll be leaving now.

338
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:22,961
Why don't you stay with us, Kaji?

339
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:25,182
I'd be laughed at if I went to work in this.

340
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,566
1t'll be okay.

341
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,503
Hey, ¢'mon, Mr. Kaji...

342
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:32,793
Later.

343
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,769
He smelled of lavender...

344
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,681
Please take care of Katsuragi.

345
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:43,682
Sure.

346
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:44,716
Well, 'night.

347
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,007
Good night.

348
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:50,989
What's wrong? You look down.

349
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,070
It's because I kissed you!

350
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:54,492
Next Day

351
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:55,894
Next Day
Well, let me call the girl's roll. Ayanami...

352
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:59,130
Well, let me call the girl's roll. Ayanami...

353
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,821
Oh, Ayanami's absent again?

354
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:04,111
Nerv Headquarters

355
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,533
Deep Underground Facility
Central Area

356
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:06,595
Central Dogma

357
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,577
Same — 2008 Meters Underground

358
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,422
Terminal Dogma

359
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,810
Hi, how's your hangover?

360
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,378
I'm finally sober now, thanks.

361
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,513
Glad to hear it.

362
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:52,317
Is this your day job, or your side job?

363
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:53,418
I wonder which?

364
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:57,222
Ryoji Kaji of Special Duty Organization Nerv's
Special Inspection Department...

365
00:20:57,223 --> 00:21:02,127
Also, Ryoji Kaji of the Investigation Department
of the Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs.

366
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:03,228
So you know all about it.

367
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:05,430
Don't underestimate Nerv.

368
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,265
Is this an order from Commander Ikari?

369
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,733
My own discretion.

370
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,836
If you keep doing this other job, you'll die.

371
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:14,557
Commander lkari is using me.
I can still keep going.

372
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:18,843
However, I will apologize for hiding it from you.

373
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,279
I'll call it even in thanks for yesterday.

374
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,848
Thanks very much, but...

375
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:27,786
The Commander and Ritchan are hiding
things from you too, and...

376
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:28,607
This is it.

377
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:36,716
This is...

378
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:40,922
Eva? No!

379
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,101
Impossible...

380
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:48,112
Yes, this is the origin and linchpin of
everything since the Second Impact.

381
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:50,942
This is Adam.

382
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:53,373
Adam? The First Angel is here?

383
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:56,381
You're right.

384
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:59,012
Nerv is deeper in this than I thought.

385
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:00,828
To Be Continued

386
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:07,278
Preview

387
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,953
The puffed-up Shinji gets swallowed
in a Sea of Dirac.

388
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,490
The short amount of time left to him
teaches him the meaning of despair.

389
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:18,730
