## Notes
> The subtitles are a mix of my own prior edit of Kuro’s subs, along with DDY’s subs, and our own edits applied over it with a fresh TLC to some lines. Dialogue styling was matched to Vivid’s styling of the series (which we intend to most likely do as well at some point). Karaoke for the ED was added thanks to the DDY’s series release (they didn’t include it in their OVA subs).
