1
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,380
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,020
Got it?

3
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,740
Where am I...

4
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,370
What happened...

5
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,180
What happened to me?

6
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,480
It's a very ugly robot.

7
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,110
Eight.

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,480
I'm going to get serious now.

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,120
I remember it all, now.

10
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,510
I...

11
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,530
I...

12
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,060
I can't let it end here!

13
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,560
A butler is one who serves.

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,060
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

15
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:59,030
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

16
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,070
Yes.

17
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:08,940
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

18
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,790
That voice!

19
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,980
It's like a scream of suffering.

20
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,190
Fantasy-Science Thriller, start!

21
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,920
Butler uniforms aren't the best on you, after all.

22
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,240
Eh? What?

23
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,740
Are you going to...

24
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,120
Yes! Super-Moe pose.

25
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,590
No, we'll save that for another occasion.

26
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,290
"Another occasion"?

27
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,230
So I'm scheduled to cross-dress?

28
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,200
Wh-What was I imagining?

29
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,170
Yeah, at some point.

30
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,160
Depending on the ratings, it may come earlier than later.

31
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,010
But leaving that aside,

32
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,620
today, we're going to the amusement park,
so I was thinking that outfit isn't the best for it.

33
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,960
Amusement park?

34
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,320
Therefore, let's get him changed.

35
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,400
Help me, Maria!

36
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,150
Yes.

37
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,950
Wait! Please! I can get changed myself!

38
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,730
You look pretty good.

39
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,060
Geez, I can get changed myself.

40
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,380
In clothes like that, you look like the boy you should be.

41
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,170
Let's go now, Hayate.

42
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,080
Yes.

43
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,560
Nagi, your hat!

44
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,630
Eh?

45
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,110
But Milady, is it all right for you to go to the amusement park?

46
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,730
Fine how?

47
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,140
Well, you are a hikikomori after all.

48
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,520
Don't treat me as the epitome of a modern culture epidemic.

49
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,590
But you are not comfortable leaving the house, right?

50
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,900
Don't be a fool; what are you saying?

51
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,230
Who would leave the house just to go to the amusement park?

52
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,240
Eh?

53
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,300
It's on the grounds.

54
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,310
Is...

55
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:19,950
Is...

56
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,630
Is...

57
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,610
Is this Michael ****son's house?!

58
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,620
Pop!

59
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,480
See, we didn't have to leave the house, right?

60
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,710
Wow, the Sanzenins' quality is incomparable to others'.

61
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,750
But Isumi and Saku's houses have them, too.

62
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,440
Are you all Pres***, owning various things by yourselves...

63
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,230
But why come to an amusement park all of a sudden?

64
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:49,370
Well, that's because, at the beach class,
I couldn't play much with you because of all that happened.

65
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,840
And, I wanted to spend the remaining short break with you...

66
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,230
Ah, well... you know...

67
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,990
But, an empty amusement park is a little lonely.

68
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,000
Hey look, look, friends of the forest!

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,450
What?

70
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,890
A new friend has come today!

71
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,950
Milady, what's this?

72
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,760
It's an amusement park,
so of course there are mascot characters.

73
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:20,570
I'm this Nagi Nagi Land's fairy of the forest, Keru Naguru-chan!

74
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,580
Keru Naguru-chan = Kick Punch-chan.

75
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,860
I'd hate to be named like that.

76
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,700
But really, it's been forever since we last had a visitor here.

77
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,570
Seriously... Thank you for coming.

78
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,030
Thank you so much!

79
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,410
I think I just heard his true voice.

80
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,100
B-By the way, when was the last time you came here, Milady?

81
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,430
I think three years ago.

82
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,050
Three years?

83
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,790
Three years...

84
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,990
The person inside must have it tough.

85
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,140
There's no one inside!

86
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,600
But you're a costume...

87
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,960
I said there's no one inside!

88
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,200
We're the fairies of the forest!

89
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,930
Yes, we're fairies!

90
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,870
Everyone!

91
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,240
Nagi Nagi Stretch is starting!

92
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,430
But why did you build such
an amazing amusement park in the house?

93
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,640
The old man gave it to me a long time ago for my birthday.

94
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,920
Old man...

95
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,820
That person I met...

96
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,710
What's wrong, Hayate?

97
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,700
N-No, nothing.

98
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,160
But, a birthday present, huh?

99
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,980
I guess he's a good grandfather to you.

100
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,700
Do you really think so?

101
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,910
He isn't?

102
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,910
If you really think so, then take a good look around.

103
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,510
Good look?

104
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,780
The rides in this park turn out to have...

105
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,920
a minimum height restriction of 140cm.

106
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,590
A minimum of 140cm!

107
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,390
And another of 140cm!

108
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:53,190
So I can't ride most of the rides here.

109
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,790
It's a very expensive prank.

110
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:00,260
That old man would never do anything that would make me happy.

111
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,500
That's why I hate him.

112
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,970
She's still small and can't ride, but you can, right?

113
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,710
Everyone, come over here!

114
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,440
We have the first person to ride the rides!

115
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,480
Eh?

116
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,640
EH?!

117
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,600
Are you all right, Hayate?

118
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,390
Yes, but I'd prefer something a little more safe next time.

119
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,360
Then how about the Haunted House?

120
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,650
Haunted House?

121
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,730
That sounds good.

122
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,530
That doesn't have a height restriction.

123
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,990
No! W-W-W-What are you saying?

124
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,240
T-T-T-The Haunted House is scary!

125
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,080
Well, that's what Haunted Houses are made for.

126
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,760
No, I'm not scared.

127
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,240
I'm not scared, you hear?

128
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,910
But... it's dangerous if there's a hole in the floor.

129
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:51,840
This isn't good. At this rate, they'll skip the Haunted House.

130
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,560
Waste of all the practice.

131
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,620
But we might get fired if we make her cry.

132
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,860
That'd be a problem.

133
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,840
I'll go check if there's anything dangerous.

134
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,900
If you insist so much.

135
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,790
He's entering....

136
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,410
Alone?

137
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,810
All by himself?

138
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,330
Then we'll trip him up.

139
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,170
We are?

140
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,990
I'll be off then.

141
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,890
Take care, all right?

142
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,050
Wow, they made a really good one.

143
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,860
It really is amazing.

144
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,050
Milady might cry because of this.

145
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,690
What was that for?

146
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,160
It's my job to scare you.

147
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,740
I'd die before being surprised!

148
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,990
But don't worry, I'll use the flat of the blade.

149
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,640
I don't see a flat.

150
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,580
Hayate.

151
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,480
I might be allowed to use the move in this situation.

152
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,290
Please make sure to get permission.

153
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,470
Dra*** Shiryu ultimate move.

154
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,390
Roza-

155
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,960
Not happening, baby.

156
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,490
What is this about?

157
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,400
I feel threat from you while you're trying to fake an accident.

158
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,840
What am I doing this for?

159
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,540
That's because...

160
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,110
...I have a grudge against you, I guess.

161
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,890
Y-You're!

162
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,480
Who were you?

163
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,050
You don't remember me?!

164
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:34,810
I don't know who you are,
but what grudge do you hold against me?

165
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,950
I won't forgive you.

166
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,610
Click.

167
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:43,740
You can't see me in this dark, can you?

168
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,730
I'll be moving to your side now.

169
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,300
Damn it.

170
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,170
Can you handle the pressure?

171
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,890
We turned the light on so our Lady wouldn't be scared.

172
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,990
You're right; I won't be scared with this.

173
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,810
Hayate! You're safe!

174
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,610
Y-Yes.

175
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,080
What is that?

176
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,850
I don't know what that is, but it's a very ugly robot.

177
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,050
Y-You...

178
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,660
...little brat!

179
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,890
Die!

180
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,090
Milady! Watch out!

181
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,970
What do you think you're doing when you're new here?

182
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,040
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

183
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,500
I've been waiting here for years!

184
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,600
Damn you!

185
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,120
Debt-ridden butler, you'd better remember this!

186
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,950
I'll definitely come get my revenge!

187
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,780
Wh-What was that?

188
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,520
No clue.

189
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,770
Milady.

190
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:43,990
Let us go on.

191
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,010
It's summer, after all.

192
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,790
Please enjoy the amusement park to your heart's content.

193
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,530
Hayate.

194
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,070
Yeah, let's go!

195
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,610
I'm so bored.

196
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,710
Not a single customer's coming...

197
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:10,130
It's the summer, so I was hoping I might get to see Hayate-kun if I worked here, but...

198
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,510
Hayate! Hurry!

199
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,450
Let's get on the Merry-Go-Round next!

200
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,180
Yes, Milady!

201
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,490
Love. It's about crossing paths.

202
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,170
Continuing to Part B.

203
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,900
Tou tou yonin gumi

204
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,900
Tou tou yonin gumi = We're finally a group of four.

205
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,940
Mimi no nagai doubutsu nanda?

206
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,940
Mimi no nagai doubutsu nanda = What animal has long ears?

207
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,820
We will now start the test of the new nursing robot, Nine.

208
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,410
Contact! Activate Nine!

209
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:54,990
Activating!

210
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,570
Deploy targets!

211
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,010
Fire Nursing Missiles!

212
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,420
All missiles hit!

213
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,320
Good. Fire Nursing Laser!

214
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,140
Okay, activate Nursing Rugio Hammer.

215
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,140
Note: This is a pun on "Kaigorudion" (Kai Goldion) vs. "Kaigo Rudion" (Nursing Rudion)

216
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:26,850
Approved!

217
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,060
We tried, at least.

218
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,000
The experiment is a success.

219
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,870
Now there will be no enemies against the elderly.

220
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,770
Chief! A high-speed unknown is approaching Nine!

221
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,110
"Unknown"?

222
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,080
It's too small to identify.

223
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,090
Nine, intercept it!

224
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,020
Boost, on!

225
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,040
M-My Nine...

226
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,010
All right, I got the controller chip.

227
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,430
Insert.

228
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:24,450
Spin spin spin spin.

229
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:32,020
Now that debt-ridden butler isn't my rival.

230
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,940
Hey!

231
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,540
You robot there!

232
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,260
What company's spy are you?

233
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,160
M-Makimura-san.

234
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,430
Even you forgot about me?

235
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,470
Wait!

236
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,010
That robot looks familiar.

237
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,860
Damn it... Makimura-san, please wait for me.

238
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,820
I'll... I'll definitely...

239
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:02,790
Maria, today was really, really fun!

240
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:07,620
Hayate would go wham and bam!

241
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,580
Yes, yes.

242
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,460
Hayate enjoyed it a lot, too.

243
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,430
Doing good things for other people makes you happy, too, doesn't it, Maria?

244
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,740
I understand you, so you should get your sleep.

245
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,370
I wonder if Hayate-kun's all right.

246
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,270
I did all the first aid I could.

247
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,060
I'm burned out.

248
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,470
I'm white ash.

249
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,800
It's my chance.

250
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,690
I'll do him in and...

251
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,790
Hold it!

252
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,250
Huh?

253
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,060
He's mine!

254
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,850
You're the robot from the afternoon!

255
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,220
You're the nursing robot that came out
in episode three and got defeated by Hayate,

256
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,940
Eight!

257
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,540
Oh!

258
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,790
You know me?

259
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,470
Tama, how do you alone remember him?

260
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:01,510
Hayate, unlike you,
who is sitting pretty on the main character's seat,

261
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:05,650
I'm watching this anime's opening every week to the point that I have it down solid.

262
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,450
Because it's the only section where I am sure to show up!

263
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,780
And this Eight is in a similar situation.

264
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,660
He doesn't have any show time in the show,
yet shows up in the opening.

265
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,660
That's why I noticed!

266
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,660
Eh? Was this robot in the opening?

267
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,570
I haven't seen the kind people recently, either.

268
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,540
So, time to get my revenge!

269
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,000
It's a really pounding background noise.

270
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,940
What's going on?

271
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,660
Let's leave it to Hayate.

272
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,510
He's in great condition today.

273
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,220
Whee...

274
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:45,120
Revenge? It's your own fault for losing control!

275
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,660
Shut up! Because I lost to you, I... I lost everything!

276
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:55,430
Eight, you have to become the world's best nursing robot.

277
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:01,710
I did tests after tests to meet the scientist's standard.

278
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,030
It was boring, but I did my best.

279
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,280
Because...

280
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,950
Are you doing okay over there, Eight?

281
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,320
Because she was there.

282
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,450
Eight!

283
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,640
You're amazing!

284
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,050
You're so cool, Eight!

285
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,310
Eight~

286
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,460
Beat the Vandel ******.

287
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,190
She was everything to me.

288
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,840
But that day!

289
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,900
What? Eight lost to a trash among humans?

290
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,820
Defeated in such a way, too?

291
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,790
My nursing missiles were ineffective?

292
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,140
Chief...

293
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,100
Then I guess we'll terminate development.

294
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,860
Beside, it's wrong to try and let robots do everything.

295
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,660
Plus the design and the functions were so lame.

296
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,280
Ch-Chief!

297
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:48,890
I lost everything as such
and got thrown away as noncombustible trash.

298
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,060
Chief has her own world and is forgetful, so she forgot about me...

299
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,570
...and was working on developing a new nursing robot.

300
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,330
But... But my heart won't be salvaged with that.

301
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,170
In order for me to get her smile back,

302
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:10,950
Hayate, I need to beat you and that twin-tailed brat!

303
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,010
Wh-What? You're only a pet.

304
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,590
Shut up, you scrap ****!

305
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,140
I don't care what you do to the miserable, stupid, human trash, debt-ridden butler,

306
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:32,000
but I won't forgive anyone who tries to hurt the Lady.

307
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,950
You're right; Our Lady is selfish, self-centered, and rude.

308
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,890
Her acts are based on whims, and she never admits mistakes.

309
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,660
She's tougher than others,
doesn't know the real world, is cheeky,

310
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,160
but can't sleep alone at night.

311
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,900
She proclaims to have high athleticism when she doesn't.

312
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,390
As such, she's a failure as a human,

313
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,120
but she's the one who saved my life.

314
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,920
What's wrong, Nagi?

315
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,090
I don't know, but I feel like someone just spoke badly of me.

316
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:04,260
So, I'll destroy everything that becomes Our Lady's enemy.

317
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:06,960
Wait!

318
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,890
Hayate! Y-You...

319
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:13,170
You're going to shield him when he tried to kill you?

320
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,740
I know the sadness of being abandoned and forsaken.

321
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:25,620
But, because there was a person who saved us...

322
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,550
...we are here today!

323
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,520
You understand that, too, Tama.

324
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,260
So you...

325
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,250
So you understand how I feel?

326
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,310
Since I've gone through a similar experience.

327
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,700
I see.

328
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,280
If you understand my feeling,

329
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,580
then be killed by me!

330
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,120
The sound's getting louder.

331
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,600
According to the report from Security, the nursing robot from sometime ago is here for revenge and is causing a rampage.

332
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,350
Are you sure you don't need to go save him?

333
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,060
Hayate won't lose against someone he fought once before.

334
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:09,000
But apparently he versioned up to 8.1 and powered up.

335
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,770
8.1? That's just adding a patch file.

336
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:15,800
Besides, Hayate is fighting for me.

337
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,780
Doesn't that turn you on a little?

338
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,270
I hope he hasn't turned into a ball of flame.

339
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:26,220
Take this, my new ultimate mode that came with the new version!

340
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,610
Mosquito Destroy Mode!

341
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,050
Japan's summer is filled with mosquitoes.

342
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:37,260
It's a necessary mode for providing the nursed one a pleasant sleep.

343
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,850
Um, how about we call it quits?

344
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,230
You won't win against us with that.

345
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,730
Shut up! I must have her-

346
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,500
Eight!

347
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,070
Th-That voice... It can't be...

348
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,440
C-Chief!

349
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,490
Eight, thank goodness, you were here.

350
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,680
I remembered about you.

351
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,080
S-So? What did you come here now for?

352
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,020
I'm already abandoned by you.

353
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,010
I'm sorry.

354
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,610
But you got it all wrong.

355
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:08,990
There was a slight mistake.

356
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,450
Chief...

357
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:15,630
I was thoughtless and threw you out as noncombustible...

358
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:18,560
I'm really sorry...

359
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:19,900
Chief...

360
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,860
I was wrong.

361
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,470
It's fine now.

362
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,240
Eight, you are not noncombustible trash.

363
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,900
It's so tear-jerking.

364
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,840
Yes.

365
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,540
You're oversized trash.

366
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:40,140
Hello, we're the ones you called for.

367
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,630
Please take care of it.

368
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,600
Is this it?

369
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,920
Yes, take it away, please.

370
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,060
Ch-Chief?

371
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,210
Do you know there's a law for recycling household appliances?

372
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:50,350
You're not supposed to throw
large electronic devices away on the street.

373
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,750
But don't worry, they'll take you apart and trash you properly.

374
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,270
Bye now.

375
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,590
We're lucky Milady was the one that picked us up.

376
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,170
Yeah.

377
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,090
Wait, this isn't the right way to end this at all!

378
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,060
We need to do something to save Eight!

379
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,650
But how?

380
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,840
Leave it to me.

381
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,600
Hey, this Makimura?

382
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,950
It's me, Sanzenin Nagi.

383
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:23,200
Listen, you mustn't break that rundown robot.

384
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,200
That's right.

385
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,380
Didn't I sound just like her?

386
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,300
I never knew you had such a trick!

387
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,820
Hayate! Hayate!

388
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,070
Did you use Kamehame** to defeat him last night?

389
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,710
No, I can't use that yet.

390
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,810
By the way, soon after leaving the mansion,

391
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,780
Makimura-san, please go out with me!

392
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,250
What? Sure.

393
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,210
Eight started a new life.

394
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:54,890
Next time, we'll fight against the lord of the lake to be the champion of the Slympics.

395
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:30,920
Nagi and...

396
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,520
Isumi's...

397
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,260
Butler Network!

398
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:40,440
Last week, Isumi couldn't say anything about the song, so today, I'm here to support her.

399
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,180
Thank you, Nagi.

400
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:49,140
So Isumi, this song is, you know, slow like you, and then thickened and has fat added and all cooked together.

401
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,110
I don't think that made any sense.

402
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,750
Anyway, it's a nice song.

403
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,530
Thank you, Nagi.

404
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
Bye bye.

405
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,990
This time, it's fishing.

406
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,920
We'll catch all we can!

407
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,200
First, it's fly fishing!

408
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,690
Fly fishing? Isn't that challenging?

409
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:09,790
In "I Love Fishing. Sanpei", Sanpei-kun was catching one fish after another using flies.

410
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:12,120
There isn't anything I can't do when Sanpei-kun can.

411
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,580
Milady, it's not good to mix manga and reality.

412
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,640
Hit, hit, hit!

413
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,120
DAAAHH!

414
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,590
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

415
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,940
Who Came Up With the Onomatopoeia "Kapo~n"? It's Amazing.

416
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,940
I didn't expect Hayate to come so close the moment we were alone.

417
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,450
The entertainment level will be in the red zone as usual.
