1
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:09,410
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:09,990
Got it?

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,840
Time sure flies.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,920
It's already the new semester.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,390
I've got to start with a fresh mindset.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,050
You have a wonderful attitude as always.

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,320
Good morning, Maria-san.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,510
I'll go wake Milady up.

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,400
Ah, you don't have to worry about that.

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,970
She won't be going to school today.

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,420
Oh, okay.

12
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,210
EH?!

13
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,790
It seems she caught a fever.

14
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,440
Hayate... Are you there, Hayate?

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,700
Yes, Milady!

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,090
I'm going to school.

17
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,440
You can't!

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,300
Schools are meant to be skipped when you're in good health.

19
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,270
Skipping school with this level of fever won't cut it for the King of NEETs.

20
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,400
More of her nonsense again.

21
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,990
What are you doing, Hayate?

22
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,390
Please, rest well.

23
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,000
I'll skip school, also, to nurse you today.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,540
Hayate...

25
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,750
No!

26
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,550
If you skipped school for me, it would affect your grades.

27
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,570
One day won't do anything.

28
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,730
Things are different for a genius like me and you.

29
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:26,420
One missed day is detrimental to a transfer student like you.

30
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,560
Milady!

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,500
Don't worry about me!

32
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,400
I'm...

33
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,430
I'm fine...

34
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,270
I won't die from this.

35
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,270
So leave this to me and-

36
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,980
I don't want to, Milady!

37
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,590
You must go! Now!

38
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,010
Milady!

39
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,010
What the heck is wrong with this anime?

40
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,520
A butler is one who serves.

41
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,790
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

42
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,960
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

43
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,980
Yes.

44
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:05,980
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

45
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,860
Okay, class is starting.

46
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,450
Sensei, I have a question.

47
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,710
Yes, Azumamiya-kun?

48
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,610
She looks good as a teacher, too!

49
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,310
I wonder if Milady is all right.

50
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,280
Good morning!

51
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,450
Hinagiku-san.

52
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,100
It's been a while.

53
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,660
Yes, you're right.

54
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,720
So, were you able to master an ultimate move?

55
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,320
No, I did my best, but...

56
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,600
No need to rush.

57
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,130
Thank you very much.

58
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,730
And is Nagi skipping school as usual?

59
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,800
No, she caught a fever on the very first day of the new semester.

60
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,120
Eh? That worries me.

61
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,750
Yes.

62
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,240
Maybe I should pay a visit.

63
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,130
Please! I'm sure Milady will be happy.

64
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,980
Then after school, I'll stop-

65
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,420
Hinaemon! Help me Hinaemon!

66
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,420
SFX: DONG!!

67
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,340
You're so noisy in the morning.

68
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,150
You're so mean, Hinaemon.

69
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,390
You're going to beg for money again, aren't you?

70
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:46,570
No! Your Sis has more problems than money!

71
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,770
Don't brag about it!

72
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,010
Um, what happened?

73
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,860
Ayasaki-kun! Thank you for asking!

74
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,700
Because a new teacher's coming,
I got demoted to sub-homeroom teacher!

75
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,310
A new teacher?

76
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,760
Nice to meet you. I'm Makimura.
I'll be your homeroom teacher from today.

77
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,520
Eh?

78
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,490
I look forward to spending time with you all.

79
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,510
Makimura-sensei, huh?

80
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,410
I don't have a problem if she's an easier teacher than Yukiji.

81
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,430
I don't care either way.

82
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,030
Why? Why is that nursing robot developer here?

83
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,700
Allow me to explain.

84
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,320
Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven, and Twelve.

85
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,380
All of them went berserk or something similar and thus broke down and burned up.

86
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,100
Ah?

87
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,450
Makimura-kun, what do you think of these results?

88
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,640
Let's see...

89
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,790
Not enough firepower?

90
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,220
What do you want to cause more explosions for?

91
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,590
I-I'm sorry.

92
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,860
Do you understand what
the most important aspect of a scientist is?

93
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,000
The most important aspect?

94
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,300
Yes. What you must always keep in mind as a developer.

95
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,470
That's of course-

96
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,540
I get it! It's cake, isn't it? Cake!

97
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,470
Sweets are good for your brain.

98
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:09,890
Yes, the pleasure centers of your nervous system
get stimulated and endorphin is secreted in your brain.

99
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,570
NO!!!

100
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,200
It's heart!

101
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,400
You're lacking heart.

102
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:26,180
Makimura-kun, in order for you to learn what heart is,
I'll have you be a teacher at your old high school, Hakuou.

103
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,490
Do you understand the situation now?

104
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,070
Both Hayate and you in front of the screen?

105
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,490
Yes, for the most part.

106
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,010
On a side note, the eyes Katsura-sensei is looking at Makimura-sensei with are really scary.

107
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,870
Everyone, let's spend the day with a smile!

108
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:49,830
Hmph, who does she think she is?
She can't possibly get a grasp of the student heart that easily.

109
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:52,460
First, I'd like to know all your level, so I'd like to do a pop quiz.

110
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,320
What? Seriously?

111
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,170
That's just  great.

112
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,800
Oh my, we have whiners.

113
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:01,800
I've won.

114
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,500
No students will follow you to a rigorous lesson style like this.

115
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,940
Okay, put your pencils down.

116
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,740
Collect the papers in order, please.

117
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,300
It was pretty hard.

118
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,710
Yeah, give me a break.

119
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,120
All right, then it's about time I show
my popularity as the senior teacher.

120
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,000
Good work, everyone.

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,390
A test right after a vacation was harsh, wasn't it?

122
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,560
I understand exactly what it felt like.

123
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,060
So the average is 82.3%.

124
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,710
You're all so smart.

125
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,920
It looked like Segawa-san and Hanabishi-san had several minor calculation errors.

126
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,930
Asakaze-san's weak point is long reading comprehension.

127
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,940
Ayasaki-kun, you have your basics down solid.

128
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,510
Um, Sensei, what are you talking about?

129
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:49,110
"What?" I'm only announcing the result of the test.

130
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:54,860
Wait, do I have to actually mark these when I grade them?

131
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,830
That's such a bother!

132
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,160
Oh, I know!

133
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,330
Katsura-sensei, can I ask you to do it?

134
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:00,630
Huh?

135
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,760
Here you go.

136
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,860
Hey, why me?

137
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,740
Sensei! I have a question on problem 2!

138
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,800
Sensei! Tell me how to solve problem 5, please!

139
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,190
Sensei~

140
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:17,940
Um...

141
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,540
I see. She's as smart as a supercomputer.

142
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,650
I can understand how Katsura-chan was taken off the homeroom teacher position.

143
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,340
Farewell, Yukiji.

144
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,110
Have a good life even after you leave here.

145
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,350
I'm not leaving!

146
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,350
Good bye, Sensei!

147
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,460
Bye bye.

148
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:44,440
Crap... At this rate, my position in Hakuou, in this anime, will be in jeopardy.

149
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,580
I've got to do something immediately.

150
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,810
But what?

151
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,410
It's finally over.

152
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,610
Without Milady around, school's a little boring.

153
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,320
Hayata-kun!

154
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,070
Here, these are the handouts from today.

155
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,510
Make sure you pass them on to Nagi-chan.

156
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,800
Yes, thank you.

157
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,110
Yes, you'd better.

158
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,980
But why did you have these, Segawa-san?

159
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,410
Why? That's obvious.

160
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,200
It's because I'm the class rep.

161
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,970
Class rep?

162
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,000
Ah right, you were the class representative.

163
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,990
Hayata-kun, I'm the leader of this class.

164
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,700
Please don't forget.

165
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,010
Yes, she's red.

166
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,600
Class Rep Red!

167
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,190
And I'm Blue.

168
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,190
I'm Vice-Class Rep Blue!

169
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,630
And, I can be your enemy or ally.

170
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,300
Disciplinary Black!

171
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,630
Three of us make up-

172
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,170
The Student Council Members!

173
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,180
You guys look like you're having fun.

174
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:59,670
Hayata-kun, we specially present you with the vacant seat, Orange!

175
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,050
No, I'll pass on that.

176
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:05,550
But everyone, doesn't the student council keep you busy?

177
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,000
Not really.

178
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,070
Even if we do a half-assed work, the perfect Student Council President will do something for us.

179
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,520
Exactly.

180
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,230
SFX: HAHAHAHA~

181
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,230
Hinagiku-san must have it rough.

182
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,770
But being Class Rep can come with annoying tasks.

183
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,770
For example, this class report.

184
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,590
I need to hand it in by today.

185
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,000
Wow, there are many places to fill in.

186
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,960
No worries! These are the times when Red, Blue, and Black join forces and-

187
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,380
Orange! Let's combine our might and...

188
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,550
Okay. I'm not Orange, but I'll help.

189
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,040
Ah, there you are!

190
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,830
Ayasaki-kun, can you come with me for a second?

191
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,590
Come, hurry!

192
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,930
What about the report?

193
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,870
Ihihihi~ Ringo daisuki.

194
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,870
Ihihihi~ Ringo daisuki = *Giggle* I love apples.

195
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,880
Kisama no akuji minuitari!

196
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,880
Kisama no akuji minuitari! = Your evil acts are now under the light!

197
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,280
Sensei, what's this about?

198
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,750
All right.

199
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:15,100
Listen, Ayasaki-kun. Stand still here for a while.

200
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,880
What is this about, Sensei?

201
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,430
Do you want to know my well-planned strategy?

202
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,290
Strategy?

203
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,660
I'll give an explanation only to you, then.

204
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,680
First, that woman comes out of the staff room.

205
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,220
And I'll put the ***-Pura right there.

206
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,380
Then...

207
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:34,990
No! My precious full scratch-built Night**gale!

208
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,540
Look at what you've done!

209
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,280
But in her path waits-

210
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,780
And an added combo.

211
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,320
If I spread a picture like that around,
she'll definitely be forced to quit the school.

212
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,310
Do you understand this major plan?

213
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:01,570
I understand that something is wrong with your head.

214
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,570
What did you say?

215
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,070
Excuse me.

216
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,460
Wait!

217
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,290
Students are supposed to listen to what teachers say!

218
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,750
Let go of me!

219
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,210
I don't want to take part in a Ka**kabe Defense Force-like plot!

220
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,790
Shut up and work with me!

221
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,020
I don't want to!

222
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,790
Um, is there a problem here?

223
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,800
I heard something about a plan?

224
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,690
Eh? Um... Well... Ah...

225
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,920
I was telling him to stand on the PLATform when waiting for train.

226
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,580
Wait, that's platform, not plan!

227
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:37,870
So funny.

228
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,570
Come on, you cover me, too.

229
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,110
Go!

230
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,680
Heaven itself is my ally.

231
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,450
I never thought I'd be able to take a photo like this by accident.

232
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,220
I better post it up on billboards around the campus.

233
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,060
Hey! What's wrong with your head?!

234
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,860
I will be the God of the new world.

235
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,940
No, there's no need to rush.

236
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,150
All I have to do is explain clearly what happened.

237
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,710
Right, Makimura-sensei?

238
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,540
How could you do this to me...

239
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,010
I can't get married anymore.

240
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:22,710
That's not what happened!

241
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,920
At this rate, I'll shame Milady.

242
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,270
Did you know that Sanzenin-san's butler was...

243
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,750
What? No way.

244
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,870
I must protect Milady's honor!

245
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,200
Meanwhile, at the Sanzenin's,
where they don't know what's going on.

246
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,410
I'm glad to see that you look better than I'd thought.

247
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,210
Yeah, my fever's gone down.

248
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:53,130
So, how was your summer?

249
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:53,710
Eh?

250
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,570
I had a pretty good time.

251
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,470
First, I went to a fireworks show with Hayate.

252
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,220
Then to beach class with Hayate.

253
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,490
And I went to an amusement park with Hayate.

254
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,160
And went fishing with Hayate.

255
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,090
And then...

256
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,060
Is something wrong?

257
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,930
No, just watching you talk so enthusiastically.

258
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,570
N-No, I wasn't being so...

259
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,590
So? Let me hear more.

260
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:22,640
Sure. And then I played lots of games with Hayate.

261
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,110
Oh, and I also watched Ya**naka Seisho with Hayate.

262
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,850
They were sharing their summer memories.

263
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,850
Also-

264
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,580
Sensei! Please wait!

265
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,190
Never ever!

266
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,630
Bye bye.

267
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,030
I will take it away even if it takes force!

268
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,220
I couldn't see Hayate-kun even once over the summer.

269
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,760
Why...

270
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,720
Why not give up already?

271
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,500
You're really persistent.

272
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,420
Found you, Hayata-kun.

273
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,440
Pekopon.

274
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:35,510
"Pekopon" is a word said after finding the hidden player in a variation of hide-and-seek.

275
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,030
You're so mean; you said you'd help me write the report.

276
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,720
Segawa-san, great timing.

277
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,620
Please take that camera's memory card out.

278
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,720
What pictures are in it?

279
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:49,130
Picture of Ayasaki-kun tied up
with a rope and making a blissful face.

280
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,250
Don't make things up!

281
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,110
Hayata-kun, so you were into those kinda things.

282
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:59,720
Since you looked feminine,
I was thinking that you liked being teased.

283
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,570
When did I get that character setting?

284
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,080
Don't be so depressed, Hayata-kun.

285
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:10,000
Since, you know, I kind of like being picked on, too.

286
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,620
Eh?

287
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,490
No! Not like that!

288
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:18,240
Geez, thanks to you, Katsura-chan,
Hayata-kun now thinks I'm a strange girl!

289
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,390
I can't forgive you now.

290
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,530
Oh, then what will you do?

291
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,600
I will make this memory card mine.

292
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,950
Looks like this is the end of you.

293
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:40,030
If you take my side, I'll take full responsibility for the next three months of homework!

294
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,720
You can't possibly retrieve it with that.

295
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,010
Here you go.

296
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,150
It's settled.

297
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,630
What?

298
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,620
I'm sorry, Hayata-kun.

299
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,360
Catch me if you can.

300
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:00,770
You're...

301
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,860
Um...

302
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,870
Who are you?

303
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,710
Are you the one who made my sweet honey cry?

304
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,150
No! No! No!

305
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,270
I-It was him!

306
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,740
Huh?

307
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,550
Eight!

308
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,760
Eight!

309
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:30,190
I'm sorry, Eight. I betrayed you when I already have you.

310
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,650
Like I said, I didn't do anything.

311
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,670
Wait, when did you two have that kind of a relationship?

312
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,940
I won't forgive you!

313
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,540
Interesting.

314
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,800
You've made me get serious now.

315
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,280
In any fight I get picked on,
I'll take it on even if it goes overboard.

316
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,120
Why go that far?

317
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,030
She's actually putting up a fight!

318
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,230
You!

319
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,160
Watch out!

320
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,170
Take...

321
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,970
...that!

322
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,520
Not bad.

323
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,120
You, too.

324
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,490
Stop this! Don't fight for my sake!

325
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,300
I wonder how this is going to end.

326
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,380
Can't wait to see. So exciting.

327
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,160
What can I do?

328
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,720
That's definitely a self-destruction button no matter how you look at it.

329
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,330
All right, if I press that!

330
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,350
But no, I can't do it.

331
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:40,460
If I press that here, a tremendous explosion will happen.

332
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,970
If that were to happen...

333
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,360
Then Segawa-san would...

334
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,610
Don't worry, Hayata-kun.

335
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:54,230
No, but when someone with skirt on is nearby...

336
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,390
Like Hina-chan, I wear sports pants underneath, so I'm fine.

337
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,450
Thank you sports pants!

338
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,130
Blown to pieces!

339
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,440
Eight...

340
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,250
How sad...

341
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,930
This is all too sad.

342
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,190
Isn't it?

343
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,650
Nothing is born from violence.

344
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,320
Sensei...

345
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:35,150
He's responsible for everything that happened here.

346
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,490
But please!

347
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:42,190
Please forgive him; my request as his teacher!

348
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:48,090
Boys in puberty are really bad at controlling their hearts.

349
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,450
And it's the teachers' job to teach and guide them.

350
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:58,610
At times, it's painful and suffocating to see how delicate they are; so much that it drives us into walls.

351
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:02,050
But I will never look away from them!

352
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:05,090
Because... Because I'm a teacher!

353
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,910
Because I love them!

354
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,050
Sensei!

355
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,410
I... I finally understand.

356
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,670
I understand how heart is important.

357
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,560
Makimura-san.

358
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,230
I respect you.

359
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,130
I want to become like you.

360
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,840
I see.

361
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,370
But the road to becoming a teacher isn't easy.

362
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,880
You have much more to learn.

363
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,270
I am ready for it.

364
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,660
Okay, if you say so.

365
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,480
I will hold study sessions for you starting today.

366
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,940
Mostly at pubs.

367
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,920
At the cost of the difference in the pay between
homeroom teacher and sub-homeroom teacher.

368
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,880
How reliable!

369
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,700
She fell for my plan.

370
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,330
And thus...

371
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,280
I know a nice place I go to often.

372
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,730
Sounds good.

373
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,280
...the battle came to a conclusion.

374
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,220
Leaving behind the debt-ridden butler who learned there is more than one way to be smart.

375
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:08,070
What was all my effort for?

376
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:12,910
Now, now. The report got done, too, so all is good.

377
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,820
Th-This is...

378
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:23,020
Today, I played with Hayata-kun and others. It was fun.

379
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,900
It's not a diary!

380
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,530
Cheers!

381
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,850
Oh yeah, please take care of the bill here, Sensei.

382
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:32,570
EH?!

383
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,560
Because you're older than me and my senior.

384
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,040
Thanks for the treat.

385
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:54,860
SFX: SMACK

386
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,400
What goes around comes around.

387
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,000
Interesting how the world works.

388
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,960
Next time, it's a must-see for girls.

389
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,850
We'll fight against moe points.

390
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,360
There wasn't much screentime for me this week!

391
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,130
Calm down. There are days like that, too.

392
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:30,990
Nagi and...

393
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:31,930
Hayate's...

394
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,220
Butler Network!

395
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,590
Earth, I love you! I'm Sanzenin Nagi.

396
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,890
I'm Ayasaki Hayate.

397
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,440
'ey there! It's Sakuya. How you doin'?

398
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,980
But this song is really girly, unlike Saku's image.

399
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,410
You think so? The powerful words fit perfectly with her image.

400
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:50,270
What's with you two's random comments?

401
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:53,470
Besides, you two haven't heard the song yet as we dub this.

402
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,280
Ah, she spoiled it.

403
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,120
The director and staff are troubled over it,

404
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,380
so get the song ready fast please; GENEON's-

405
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,150
See you next week!

406
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,880
Hey, what's that for?!

407
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,360
Hayate-sama, you look happy.

408
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,350
Yes. A certain person said "thank you" to me.

409
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,790
My.

410
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,700
Things haven't been going too well recently.

411
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,830
People glare at me, too.

412
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,930
So I was a little depressed.

413
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,030
Hayate-sama.

414
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:14,660
Yes?

415
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:18,020
I love you, Hayate-sama.

416
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,340
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

417
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:22,440
I've Never Experienced Facing Trouble for Being Too Popular.

418
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,030
Yesterday, it looked like they were hugging each other.

419
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,410
Interesting for sure!
