1
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,050
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:18,410
One morning, a boy stepped through the door to the Twilight Zone.

3
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,070
Could that be...

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,210
Vertical pan action.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,850
Zoom and horizontal pan action.

6
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,580
It's Isumi.

7
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,690
But, what is she dressed in?

8
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,420
Turned on by her clothes, boy?

9
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,260
WHAT?! She got on the bus without any hesitation!

10
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,260
This is ridiculous...

11
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:58,890
I'm getting on!

12
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,420
Go return the telephone pole to where you found it.

13
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,740
Ah, right.

14
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,520
Otherwise, TEP** will yell at you.

15
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,430
You're right.

16
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,480
I'm getting on!

17
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,330
I missed it!

18
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,220
You reap what you sow.

19
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,230
Isumi...

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,860
What in the world is going on?! Tell me!

21
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,630
Anytime you decide to come to my place,
you ask the most incomprehensible questions.

22
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,340
But she was wearing a blazer!

23
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,130
That's an easy answer.

24
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,400
You haven't seen Isumi recently, have you?

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,910
Yeah, I guess. Due to final exams and what not.

26
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,060
You saw an illusion!

27
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,710
I...llusion?

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,780
Yes, it has to be an illusion.

29
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,990
Everyone in the city looks like Isumi to you.

30
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,300
That can't possibly happen!

31
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,080
She was definitely Isumi!

32
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,190
Then how about this?!

33
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,070
She fell in love with a boy at another school
and is sneaking into the school wearing their uniform.

34
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:06,540
Yeah, since there are girls who transfer to all-boys schools in disguise just to be with the men they like.

35
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,170
On another note, you play along well at a time like this.

36
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,410
You could say that.

37
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,880
But man, the world has come to that?

38
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,510
Yes.

39
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,910
Even if there's a gate there,

40
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,290
or a wall,

41
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,950
or Nu****be,

42
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,390
Girls will jump over them!

43
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,900
It can't be...

44
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,140
No way...

45
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,290
Isumi is...

46
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,040
...trying to climb over it?!

47
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,730
Up I go.

48
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,310
I'm sorry, we eavesdropped.

49
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,220
I don't mind.

50
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,940
We won't fully deny the possibility,
but isn't the case you describe pretty rare?

51
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,350
I don't think you had to go and corner in a boy who's already distressed.

52
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,510
Messing with him is fun.

53
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,480
I mean, Isumi on a bus with a blazer.

54
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,950
It's a bit of a shame it wasn't
a sai*** uniform with a machinegun.

55
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,390
It's too old a reference.

56
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,630
It looks interesting, so Hayate, look into it for me.

57
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,540
Thanks.

58
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,090
Milady. Because it looks interesting?

59
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:03,330
Did you all know that there's a huge mansion like this in the middle of Tokyo?

60
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,990
The name of the mistress who lives there is Sanzenin Nagi.

61
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,830
And...

62
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,110
Her butler's name is Ayasaki Hayate.

63
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,890
The two are slightly airheaded...

64
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,300
...and they misunderstand each other a bit...

65
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,130
...but they are bound by a tight master-butler bond.

66
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,970
Isumi has a guy she likes?! Oh no!

67
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,680
What's the matter, Sir?

68
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,580
D***IN today and D***IN tomorrow.

69
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,170
Sir! Ryu***do was mixed in with Power Rangers!

70
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,140
It was?

71
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,630
I'll put it away, then.

72
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,760
Sir, that's the shelf for special effects shows.

73
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,670
Gi**ra, Koke**ro, and Shouchiku...

74
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:32,270
Special effect shows are your specialty; to make such simple mistakes...

75
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,560
Did something happen?

76
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,360
Oh, nothing.

77
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,620
But, if you're so obviously disappointed...

78
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,850
What could have happened to Sir?

79
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,120
As his maid, I can't let this be!

80
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,260
A-Are you all right?

81
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,500
H-Hayate-san.

82
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,600
So he was acting like that.

83
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,520
After all, Milady did lay it on him pretty thick.

84
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,700
So that was the reason behind this.

85
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,790
Is something wrong?

86
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:07,250
No, just how he doesn't open up to me.

87
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,840
I'm sure it's something like it's easier to talk with Lady Nagi, who is the same age as him.

88
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,150
So being older than him is a handicap for me?

89
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,680
No, no, no, no, no.

90
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,290
After all, I did break the twenty year barrier, so am I past my expiration date?

91
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,980
Th-That's not the issue!

92
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,530
You're still in your prime!

93
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,040
Even if you were married...

94
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,170
Hey, that was...

95
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,190
Sir!

96
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,320
Is it all right to do this?

97
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,040
No, it's not.

98
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,280
Sir!

99
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,780
If I remember correctly...

100
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,180
Yes, keep panning down.

101
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,220
That uniform was...

102
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,530
Even if what Nagi said was correct...

103
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,430
Augh, thinking won't get me anywhere!

104
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,690
I didn't predict this development.

105
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,650
I will stand out in these clothes, won't I?

106
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,640
You always do.

107
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,170
In any case, normally he would have noticed us by now.

108
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,050
Next stop, Shiomi Municipal High School.

109
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:22,920
Shiomi?

110
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,200
It's been a while since I last came here.

111
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,170
This is where Isumi is...

112
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,880
Damn it! This gate won't keep Isumi and me apart!

113
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,560
Sir...

114
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,610
Isumi-san must have been wearing this school's uniform.

115
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,750
Why do you go that far for Isumi-san?

116
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,420
But, I wish I could do something for Sir's sake.

117
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:02,480
Um, if you'd like, I'll tell you how to get on the campus.

118
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,420
Butlers even know how to do that?

119
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,400
Well...

120
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,350
Rai******** Kick!

121
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,680
Why won't the gate open?!

122
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,340
Fine, take this. Back-

123
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:15,960
Sir.

124
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,620
What? What are you doing here, Saki?!

125
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,780
I could ask the same of you, Sir.

126
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,080
It doesn't matter what I'm doing here!

127
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,480
Well, it does matter to me.

128
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,160
I heard the situation from Hayate-san.

129
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,380
You think I can leave you alone in your current state?!

130
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,790
I-I got it. Thank you.

131
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,150
You can go in through the rip in the fence.

132
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,640
I don't see any rip.

133
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,440
What? But according to the map Hayate-san drew-

134
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,110
But I don't see one.

135
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,910
Oh wow. They fixed it well.

136
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:56,150
Oh, what are you doing here, Wataru-kun?

137
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,800
Y-You're...

138
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,340
Whatever. Can you let me in?

139
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,630
Sure.

140
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,040
I'm always fighting the tardy bell, so I need my ways in.

141
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,130
Not something you can brag about.

142
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,030
So, what brings you here?

143
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,870
There are times when men have to move on no matter what.

144
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,720
Sir, even if you act like ******, you only look pathetic if you're caught on the fence.

145
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,740
Shut up!

146
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,150
At any rate, will you give us a tour around the campus?

147
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,140
Sure, I don't mind.

148
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,280
It's a really normal school, I tell you.

149
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,630
A-A-A-re those...

150
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,090
U-Uhm...

151
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,220
They're a gang.

152
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,260
We're a normal school, so we have people like them.

153
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,470
Good puppy!

154
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,600
Puppies are so good. They purify our hearts.

155
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,370
What do you want?

156
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,530
What is she?

157
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,480
I don't know.

158
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,750
You don't know about female gang bosses?

159
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,150
Like I said, we're a normal high school.

160
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,710
No, no. We don't see female gang bosses these days.

161
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,380
S... Something just smelled good.

162
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,250
That was the scent of lavender.

163
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,750
See? We're a normal school,
so sometimes girls leap through time.

164
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,340
It's not the anime version.

165
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,960
It's the Harada ****yo version.

166
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,860
You can handle yourself from here, right?

167
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:22,400
I need to head to the school store, or else they'll run out of bread.

168
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,170
Bye.

169
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,880
The girl swiftly ran away.

170
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,880
Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnn.

171
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,640
Ah, hey.

172
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,070
Y-Yes.

173
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,410
So nervous.

174
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,850
Twirl twirl.

175
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,220
Looks like this isn't the place.

176
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,980
Isumi... Where is Isumi?

177
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,200
Ready?

178
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,110
Y-Yes.

179
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,250
Looks like this isn't the place either.

180
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,380
Not here either.

181
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:09,350
It's not like today's a special service episode for Isumi fans.

182
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:12,120
Float float float.

183
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,120
Isumi is searching for something in this high school.

184
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,250
Where could Isumi-san be?

185
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,560
Sir?

186
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,190
What are you grunting about?

187
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:22,960
Eh?

188
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,030
Why is Isumi wearing something like that?

189
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,830
Sir, calm down.

190
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,910
Plus, what lies before her eyes is...

191
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,350
Who is that guy with a face that makes you want to touch it and has senpai written on his back?!

192
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,660
I guess you don't watch any DVDs with the context required to understand the situation...

193
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,490
That's the golden road of youth.

194
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,460
"Senpai, please use this to wipe off your sweat" attack.

195
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,500
What?!

196
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:10,290
So that's the now-gone-from-anime-drama-and-shoujo-manga
"Senpai, please use this to wipe off your sweat" attack?!

197
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,310
Young audience, ask your father and mother, who were born in the Shouwa era, about it.

198
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,750
I am just over twenty, mind you.

199
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,750
Note: 2008 is Heisei 20, so Saki is emphasizing that she was just barely born in Shouwa era

200
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,190
A white towel is a must item for all girls in love.

201
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:28,490
But I am aware it is a symbol representing that
she is ready to accept all of his sweat and tears of youth.

202
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,290
GAAHHH!!!

203
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,210
I may have not known the real Isumi.

204
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:40,400
I never knew Isumi was seeking youth,
the days you never know when the sun shines or dims.

205
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,990
You're right. I don't have the sweat of youth flowing in me.

206
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,600
What I have in me is nasty otaku blood.

207
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,810
Has God...

208
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,510
...forsaken me?!

209
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,640
Damn, the sun's bright.

210
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,460
Sir, the sun's behind you.

211
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,430
Thanks.

212
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,930
Damn, the sun-

213
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,990
Ru ruru ruru rutawa. Hantai kara yomuto?

214
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,990
Ru ruru ruru rutawa. Read it from the tail and you get?

215
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,930
Ton to tonton. Sukina bui ha? Tontoro ro-su.

216
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,930
Ton to tonton. What's your favorite part of a pig? Fatty roast.

217
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,780
This place brings back memories.

218
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,790
But meeting old friends feels a little embarrassing.

219
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,470
I must be careful not to be spotted by anyone.

220
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,380
Hayate-kun?

221
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,400
I got spotted seven seconds and three frames in.

222
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,010
Nishizawa-san. Looks like I've been spotted.

223
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,780
Why is Hayate-kun here?

224
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,290
Did he come to see me?

225
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,280
It might be faster to ask Nishizawa-san about them.

226
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,220
Um...

227
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,430
Did anything strange happen today?

228
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,430
Would you like to eat some bread, if you don't mind that I've already taken a bite.

229
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,360
Oh, nothing.

230
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,770
What am I saying at a time like this?

231
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,150
Um...

232
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,310
Y-Yes?

233
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,580
Right, I saw you!

234
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,240
No, something other than me.

235
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,630
Then nothing really.

236
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:59,760
This is a really normal high school, so we don't have any celebrities or presidents of IT companies.

237
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,070
Right.

238
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,720
Sorry to bother you during your lunch!

239
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,250
Ah, wait!

240
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,760
I do know the Shiomi High School Seven Mysteries.

241
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,690
Eh?

242
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,330
Ever since a manager of a club suddenly passed away,

243
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,770
a number of supernatural phenomena began to take place.

244
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,110
So people started quitting from the manager position because they didn't want to stay late after school.

245
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,870
Everyone calls it the curse of the dead manager now.

246
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,540
That's all part of a very familiar sounding story.

247
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,850
It's only a rumor, after all.

248
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,260
Or maybe!

249
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,050
Could Isumi-san have been asked to exterminate it?

250
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,390
Thank you very much!

251
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,330
I'll see you later.

252
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,170
Bye.

253
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,800
Oh... So Hayate-kun didn't come to see me.

254
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,080
Dang. This fried noodle bread stings my eyes.

255
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,570
Sir...

256
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:19,050
Yeah, I don't have a broad chest.

257
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,400
And neither sweat nor tears look good on me.

258
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,440
Sir!

259
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,550
So this is where you were.

260
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,530
I won't... I won't...

261
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,270
I won't let anyone...

262
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,500
...anyone other than me wipe my senpai's sweat!!!

263
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,090
Um...

264
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,870
You can.

265
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,340
Use my body.

266
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,310
Y-You can see me?

267
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,320
Yes, kind of.

268
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,650
It's come. It has come.

269
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,150
And, what do you mean by I can?

270
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:13,580
You can use my body as a medium so that you can fulfill your wish.

271
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,880
R-Really?

272
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,880
I can?

273
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,040
Yes.

274
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,630
That's right, I'm a loser!

275
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,430
Sir!

276
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,450
What?

277
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,260
I've had enough!

278
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,810
He's too bright for me!

279
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,480
There's no way I'd-

280
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,990
You hit me.

281
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,340
Even my father never-

282
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,130
Please don't finish that line!

283
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,970
This isn't about parody! It's about your life!

284
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,530
Sir, are you really okay with this?

285
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,160
You said it yourself, "There are times when men have to move on no matter what".

286
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,400
There are times when men have to run straight at the wall no matter how tall it is.

287
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,710
Okay.

288
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:08,790
Sir!

289
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,250
But, how exactly do I tackle that huge wall?

290
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,680
Believe it or not, I have more life experience than you, Sir.

291
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,330
A fight between men would mean-

292
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,120
It has to be the baseball showdown where one pitch means everything!

293
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,590
Throw it, chuck it, pitch it.

294
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,340
Fair and square. No regrets.

295
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,760
Okay, I got it.

296
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,000
Thank you, Saki.

297
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:45,350
Maybe one day, Sir will have wings on his back and will soon take flight from the window.

298
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:50,530
Since I'm his bible for teaching what freedom is...

299
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,680
No, this was right. It's for the best.

300
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,960
She doesn't really know what she's saying to herself.

301
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,980
So even if there is a song with a similar meaning, it's a pure coincidence.

302
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,840
Over and out.

303
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,230
Saki-san, where's Wataru-kun?

304
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,430
Sir has...

305
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,760
...gone to a man's duel!

306
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:07,910
Eh?

307
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,640
Senpai.

308
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,740
Please use this.

309
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,070
Hold it right there!

310
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,720
Who are you?

311
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,980
Yeah, who are you?

312
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,320
I challenge you to baseball!

313
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:31,180
I hereby request a man-to-man fight through a one-pitch match over her white towel.

314
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:35,020
Whoever wins gets their sweat wiped by the manager.

315
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,650
Don't make up deals, will you?

316
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,160
Interesting. I accept.

317
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,440
Sir...

318
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,570
Watch me, Isumi.

319
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,820
I will put everything that I've lived for
up to this day into this pitch!

320
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,290
What do you think he's doing, getting fired up all alone?

321
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,470
Take this!

322
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,270
My...

323
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:19,980
Sir!

324
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,820
My...

325
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,790
I'm burnt out.

326
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,390
Sir!

327
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:49,510
Saki... I may have lost... But I have no regrets.

328
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,510
Yes.

329
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,200
That was a good workout.

330
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,240
Please use this.

331
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,080
Thank you.

332
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:06,820
I guess there's nothing for you to brood over anymore.

333
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,320
Isumi-san!

334
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,790
It must have been a hard job.

335
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,580
Great job.

336
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,560
I'll take you back to your mansion.

337
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,670
I-I'm sorry, but-

338
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,320
I-Isumi...

339
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,740
I... I...

340
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,830
Wataru-kun, thank you for your help.

341
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,140
Thank you for the workout.

342
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,250
Looks like Isumi's thankful towards me.

343
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,500
I don't completely get it, but looks like things turned out well.

344
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:59,270
I guess I was just worried about things by myself... So lame.

345
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:03,330
You were a fine boy today.

346
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,540
Really?

347
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,250
Yes. You were cooler than any Sir I've seen to this day.

348
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,210
I see.

349
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,080
Let's go home.

350
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,690
We left the store completely empty.

351
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,290
Right with you, Sir.

352
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,700
Oh, so Isumi was just being a part-time manager.

353
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,780
Yes, so it seems.

354
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:34,710
I can't tell her that she was working part-time as a manager to exterminate the dead manager's spirit.

355
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,670
You often hear, "reality is stranger than fiction",

356
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,350
but you can't find strange stories that often in the world.

357
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:44,740
She's right. If not, Tamo** couldn't explain all the stories.

358
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,250
I agree, Milady!

359
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,160
No, it actually was a very strange story.

360
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,300
Next time, Hayate's rival will appear.

361
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,160
Student Council Trio's

362
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,990
Butler Network!

363
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,750
Good morning. It's Segawa Izumi.

364
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,820
It's Asakaze Risa.

365
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,830
Bomber! It's Hanabishi Miki.

366
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,620
This is the last of the Student Council Trio specials.

367
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,000
The three weeks flew by.

368
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,940
But this song is a true masterpiece
no matter how many times you hear it.

369
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,900
Yes, indeed.

370
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,990
We might even be able to be in the Kouhaku.

371
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,300
How about we make it the national anthem?

372
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,330
It should be made into this anime's opening theme.

373
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,750
All right, it's time for the service shot.

374
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,020
If you cut and paste the three
service shots, you get one picture.

375
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,880
That's amazing!

376
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,710
So we have no choice but to use it to make original goods.

377
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,920
Adios Amigos!

378
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,780
Hayate, you don't have to work anymore.

379
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,810
Does that mean... I'm fired?

380
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,190
No, that's not what I meant.

381
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:11,790
I'm saying you can take a break from your work and concentrate on studying until exams end.

382
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:16,280
I have prepared an emergency butler in case of a situation like this.

383
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,710
Nice to meet you. I'm Mecha Butler 13.

384
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,610
Next time, sure, Amuro had a place to return, but...

385
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,830
I'm more capable than him.

386
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:27,580
Next time, change switch on to Hayate, one, two, three!
