1
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,250
When watching TV,

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,750
make sure the room is well lit,

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,950
and watch from a distance.

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:09,990
Got it?

5
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,160
Hayate is a little sleep deprived these days.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,440
And the reason would be this.

7
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,290
I love you, Brenda.

8
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,940
Why are you here? Why did you wake me up?

9
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,450
Why do you try to speak love to me?

10
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,770
W-W-W-What? Don't look at me like I'm delicious.

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,510
He'll eat me!

12
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,090
Stop it... Don't eat me...

13
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,870
It's an afro.

14
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,100
I don't taste good!

15
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,650
Afro. It's an afro.

16
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,410
I'm not seasoned enough!

17
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,030
It's an afro.

18
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,730
What? It was all a dream?

19
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,100
Afro. It's an afro.

20
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,810
That looks like an afro.

21
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,220
Afro.

22
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:20,660
What?

23
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,420
Afro?!

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,300
Sorry to interrupt, but what are you showing off, and to whom?

25
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,010
Oh, you're behind me.

26
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:36,570
And who are you?

27
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,210
Nabeshin. He looks great in an afro.

28
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,820
Nabeshin. Apparently he owns four red jackets.

29
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:49,020
Nabeshin. He was asked by Kawaguchi
to make an appearance and actually came.

30
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,400
Nabeshin. So many things we can say about him.
The number of girls he scored with is-

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,230
Um, this opening is old.

32
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,320
I never knew that!

33
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,920
This is the current opening.

34
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,970
I never knew that!

35
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,110
One who masters being a butler becomes the master of the world.

36
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,840
The Butler War that shakes the planet has started!

37
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,240
I see. So that's the one you use now.

38
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,700
I want to redo it with this.

39
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,530
Think of the work required to fix the pictures.

40
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,510
Um, the subtitles are done.

41
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,610
Ah, right.

42
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,500
Then let's ignore the script and get this going.

43
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,720
I really can't tell if he's motivated or not.

44
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,890
I'll be forty-three this year.

45
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,590
So what?!

46
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,570
Sign: Mysterious Woman

47
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:11,100
The machine between my legs roars! It's a Walther P-30!

48
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,750
C-Could that be?

49
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,070
You're right, Ayasaki Hayate.

50
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,320
Right, Mikako?

51
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,210
Something like that, Director.

52
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,790
It all seems to be like a prearranged deal.

53
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,940
So die.

54
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,350
You got that from Ameyoko, didn't you?

55
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,590
How'd you know?

56
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,330
I see a sticker for Nakata Sto** on the grip.

57
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,600
Seriously?

58
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,870
Oh, you're right. It's so cheap.

59
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,870
Nakata Sto**. That's...

60
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,090
But I'll still shoot you.

61
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,190
Listen to my narration!

62
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,950
Is there a problem with not being able to handle hot food?!

63
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,930
I-Is he serious?

64
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:49,880
He's fast.

65
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,140
And he's insane.

66
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,580
Um, what are you doing?

67
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,040
Sorry, I have a deadline for a rough draft due. And next week is shooting.

68
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,380
A rough draft for an anime?

69
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,540
Something like that.

70
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,620
Oh, I haven't introduced myself, have I?

71
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,550
I hear it's a valuable business card.

72
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,400
Watanabe Shinichi.

73
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,990
Nabeshin in short.

74
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,220
Yup. I produce and direct anime.

75
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,870
Butler is a part-time job.

76
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,470
So don't get in my way.

77
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,430
Get in your way? You're the one who picked a fight with me.

78
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,790
And then you go to sleep?

79
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:24,200
Nabeshin-san! Please wake up!
Don't go to sleep in the middle of a show.

80
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,040
Sorry. I didn't get to sleep at all last night, too.

81
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,180
An all-nighter?

82
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,220
Last night was on a swing in a park-

83
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,380
Why Kawaguchi?!

84
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,680
And the reason why Kawaguchi is hopeless is-

85
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,480
I never asked anything about Kawaguchi-san.

86
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,210
Nabeshin-san. What is it this time?

87
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,220
I-I'm hungry.

88
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,830
Working in a park in the middle of the night?

89
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,800
So I heard.

90
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,750
And what a meaningless afro.

91
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,000
It really is worthless.

92
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,260
He's almost worth being a protected species.

93
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,740
I must protect him.

94
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,970
It goes there?

95
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,360
Seconds!

96
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,300
Yes, sure. Don't worry about
your metabolic syndrome and eat.

97
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,690
No worries.

98
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,980
Can I say one more thing?

99
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,720
Keep going.

100
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,320
Can I invite my wife and daughter?

101
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,960
S-Sure.

102
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,250
They're already here and eating.

103
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,190
Don't mind us.

104
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,890
Thanks for the food.

105
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,380
You finished that really fast, didn't you?

106
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,930
It was good stuff.

107
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,590
The dessert tastes good, too.

108
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,830
Tastes good.

109
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,070
And where did that good-looking maid go?

110
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,000
Maria-san?

111
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,640
She's a busy person, I'm afraid.

112
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:39,180
I thought I'd show her the DVD episode of
"Wel**** Newly Weds" we were in as thanks for the food.

113
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,680
Although we weren't newly wed at this time.

114
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,820
Why don't at least you watch?

115
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,330
I don't care about that.

116
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,320
What do you mean "that"?

117
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,820
I'm a little busy, so excuse me.

118
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,600
Hold up, Hayate-kun.

119
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,610
Please give an explanation of "that". In Kansai dialect, please.

120
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,590
We'll smack ya!

121
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,060
Sorry!

122
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,940
This is what Hayate thought.

123
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,530
I can't keep this going!

124
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,290
No, this is horrible! It's cheating!

125
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,080
And, this is one of my works.

126
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,690
Wow, so nostalgic.

127
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,510
No, no, I got carried into their pace.

128
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,510
Let's put an end to this already!

129
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:14,630
And this is the bucket type laundry machine we got from "***come Newly Weds".

130
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,110
It's so useless.

131
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,240
What is up with them...

132
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,380
Let's do it, win it, Kobayashi!

133
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,050
I will do it, in a reverse manner!

134
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,040
No... At this rate not only this mansion,
but the entire anime will get taken over.

135
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:27,450
Lululu~ Excel~ Lalala~ Excel~

136
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,490
All right, let's go!

137
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,430
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:34,470
Lululu~ Excel~ Lalala~ Excel~

139
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,550
Please forgive my husband.

140
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,260
Please.

141
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:39,840
Just like how tuna die if they don't keep swimming, he dies if he can't stay the focus of things.

142
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:42,270
Lululu~ Excel~ Lalala~ Excel~

143
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,390
I'm sorry to hear that.

144
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,010
It's not much of an apologetic gift, but...

145
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,080
Please accept these.

146
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,040
What are these?

147
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,010
It's really not worth much, but they're his Comike items.

148
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,820
You're giving them to me?

149
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,820
Please buy them.

150
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,120
At the listed cost.

151
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,390
I don't need them!

152
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,410
And madam!

153
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,300
It's enough! It's enough! It's enough! It's enough!

154
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,000
Hayate-kun.

155
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,930
Look at this.

156
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,880
Please, just leave!

157
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,960
Tama!

158
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,940
Excuse us.

159
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,230
Afros...  Afros...

160
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,710
Hayate-kun.

161
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,650
Afro returns!

162
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,310
It's only a wig.

163
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,550
She's been calling you.

164
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,550
Hayate! Where are you Hayate!

165
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,550
Thanks for having us!

166
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,860
I heard Isumi is on her way to the mansion.

167
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,310
Isumi-san is?

168
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,930
Yes, and alone, too.

169
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,350
Alone?

170
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,670
Yes. I got a letter from Isumi's place, so I'm sure.

171
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,060
Isumi-san always gets lost.

172
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,470
Where am I?

173
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,800
Where am I?

174
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,060
Knowing she gets lost, why does she always leave alone?

175
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,680
That's an easy question.

176
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,250
She thinks she's well-managed and independent.

177
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,420
SFX: Sparkle

178
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,420
I'll be fine the next time.

179
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,570
...is what she thinks.

180
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,390
But she gets lost all the time anyway.

181
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,650
So she's actually...

182
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,800
Actually?

183
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,360
Stubborn.

184
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,230
I am actually a stubborn girl.

185
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,810
Where am I?

186
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,200
And she's lost as always.

187
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,140
Oh no. Oh no.

188
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,110
SFX: Sparkle

189
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,110
But I'll be fine today.

190
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,050
SFX: TA~DA

191
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,040
I have a cell phone with me today.

192
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:31,620
If I use this, it will tell me where I am now and which way I have to go.

193
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,120
This is what the girl thought.

194
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,490
I don't see a number pad.

195
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,490
Stare~

196
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:48,540
The newest model: 240 Mpixel, anti-blur camera. One-seg. And comes with mp3 player, but there is no keypad.

197
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,720
Stare~

198
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,850
At a closer look, it looks like it'll open.

199
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:55,310
Yes, this will open! It is made to open!

200
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,580
Open sesame!

201
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,210
Open sesame sesame!

202
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,450
Open sesame salt!

203
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,090
This cell phone is broken.

204
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,620
It's your head that's broken!

205
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,400
Sakuya. It hurts.

206
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,980
Why? Why can't you make a call with a cell?

207
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,230
What are you? A ******zuka? Have you quit thinking?

208
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,220
******zuka.

209
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,910
Isumin kikku

210
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,910
Isumin kikku = Isumin Kick

211
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,880
Kun kun kuntama ii nioi

212
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,880
Kun kun kuntama ii nioi = Sniff sniff. What a good smell.

213
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,980
Seriously, your entire day is a joke.

214
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,980
So, what are you doing here?

215
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,950
I won't tell a person who smacks others' heads with a paper fan.

216
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,330
What?

217
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,890
By the way, Nagi's house would be that direction.

218
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,480
I was just thinking of heading that direction.

219
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,440
Oh, sorry to bother you, then.

220
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,620
But, can you make it there?

221
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,920
Can't even use a cell phone.

222
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,270
A princess without any sense of direction?

223
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,270
Don't worry. I'll take you there.

224
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,750
I do not need you to help me.

225
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,820
Yeah, yeah, I gotcha.

226
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,110
Please save us!

227
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,590
Yeah, yeah, I gotcha.

228
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,360
No! I can't! I can't!

229
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,090
Please save us.

230
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:36,490
No! I can't! I can't hallucinate in the middle of a city.

231
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:41,960
I can't let things like this happen for the sake of everyone's future.

232
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,550
Calm down, Sakuya.

233
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,940
This fish is not an entity of your hallucination.

234
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,310
But you don't see a fish like this in a fish market.

235
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,750
It is a type of Tochigami.

236
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,490
Tochigami = A deity that dwells in a property's ground.

237
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,490
Tochigami?

238
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,220
It's harmless.

239
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,990
But...

240
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,250
As expected from Isumi-sama.

241
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,410
You freaked me out.

242
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,200
So, how can I help you?

243
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,330
Yes, you see...

244
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,810
I want to ask for your help in phantom busting.

245
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,180
Phantom busting?

246
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,030
He's a phantom himself!

247
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,390
Absolutely not!

248
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:14,080
A phantom is tampering with our lake and we're really troubled.

249
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,760
We feel doomed like fish on a cutting board.

250
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,850
Good reference?

251
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,820
Let's go, Isumi-san.

252
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,320
This place will soon get eaten by the *** of Decay.

253
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,280
A god that says something that boring should just die.

254
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,210
Don't say that!

255
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,520
Hold on, Sakuya.

256
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,630
It's a phantom strong enough to create trouble to a whole land.

257
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,110
No matter how boring a god He may be...

258
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,000
Boring god?!

259
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,170
...it still bothers me.

260
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,030
Even if He's uber-boring?

261
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,100
Even if He is uber-boring.

262
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,930
Thank you very much.

263
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,440
I'll ignore some of the harsh words. Thank you very much.

264
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,360
A nice afro. A charming afro.

265
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,330
What is that annoying afro?

266
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,450
Please watch the first half later.

267
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,980
But Isumi's taking her time like always.

268
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,450
Um, should I go look for her?

269
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,830
Yeah, if you would. Please.

270
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:06,500
Isumi is weak, so I'm worried that she might have gotten caught up in something strange.

271
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,070
Man, we got caught up in something really strange.

272
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,860
I kinda knew you had strange powers, though.

273
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:19,590
Is the reason why you always get lost because you have to deal with phantoms like this all the time?

274
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,080
Yes, I do get bothered by them two or three times a year.

275
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,180
Then that's not the reason.

276
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,370
But he's not a phantom.

277
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,320
He's a Tochigami.

278
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,680
A fairy, if you will, created by nature.

279
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,460
If you call this a fairy, the image of Tinkerbell falls to the pits.

280
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,320
Then what's a phantom?

281
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,090
Phantoms are those that gained a spirit.

282
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,430
Gained a spirit?

283
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:47,500
For example, it's said that when cats lick lantern oil at night for twenty years, they gain a spirit and turn into a monster cat.

284
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,930
When humans gain a spirit through some method,
they'll turn into an Oni.

285
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:56,280
And those that gained a spirit are referred to as phantoms.

286
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,820
Then the phantom that's giving this guy trouble is...

287
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,280
Yes.

288
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:06,020
Since He's a Koi, the koi herpesvirus must have gained a spirit and become a phantom.

289
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:05,910
Koi = Carp

290
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,160
So I call it-

291
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,930
Phantom KHV!

292
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,710
What the hell is that?!

293
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,680
Hey, you!

294
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,440
Koi?

295
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,010
What did Phantom KHV do to you?

296
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,080
"What?"

297
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,280
Umm...

298
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,970
SFX: Blush

299
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,100
S-Served me on a plate alive.

300
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,380
What's the blushing for?

301
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,510
Getting served on a plate alive is...

302
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,460
It was when I was synchronized swimming.

303
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,710
And you'll go right into the reflection?

304
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,990
Carp's synchronized swimming.

305
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,460
What are you doing to me?

306
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,210
No, stop!

307
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,840
No, don't! Don't strip me like that!

308
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,700
I told you not to.

309
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,830
Crap, I forgot wasabi.

310
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,330
Wasabi, wasabi.

311
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,530
It's my chance!

312
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,220
Now's my chance to run! I can get away if it's now.

313
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,080
My body feels light.

314
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,220
Phantom KHV tried to eat you with wasabi?

315
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:58,640
Yes.

316
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,450
Unbelievable.

317
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,880
If it were me, I'd have made soup.

318
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,490
Oh no, please stop.

319
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,670
Anything but that.

320
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,920
Stop synchronized swimming in the soup!

321
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,680
Do you like synchronized swimming that much?

322
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,630
Do you love it?

323
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,230
Can't you control yourself?

324
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,210
Only a little.

325
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,930
He is a Tochigami despite his appearance,
so I don't think the paper fan's a good idea.

326
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,900
It's animal abuse picture-wise,
so I think you might get punished for it.

327
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,810
Sign: Portable

328
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,080
But maybe she'll be happy.

329
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,560
Tell Nagi what happened, and she might be able to use it for her manga's plot.

330
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,540
I cannot do that.

331
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,610
Why not?

332
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,420
It's so interesting. You don't find stories like this often.

333
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,750
To Nagi, who fears darkness so much, I cannot tell stories like this.

334
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,720
Now that you mention it,
when did she get so scared of the dark?

335
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,660
I don't remember her being like that when she was young.

336
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,100
Something happened, didn't it?

337
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:02,290
I didn't intend to make her cry like that.

338
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:10,680
I'm scared... I'm scared...

339
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:20,430
So I won't hurt my friends anymore.

340
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,060
I like your determination, girl.

341
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,420
Th-That voice is!

342
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,320
So it's him?

343
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:34,220
That's right. The koi herpesvirus that gained a spirit.

344
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,530
I'm the Great Phantom of KHV!

345
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,950
He has the same naming sense as you.

346
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,820
No. He added "Great" to himself.

347
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,160
It's him! He's the one that tried to serve me on a plate alive!

348
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,320
In fact, he did!

349
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,630
You think a helper like that will let you to win against me?

350
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,610
Shut up, you An***man's enemy!

351
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,730
I'm not An***man's enemy!

352
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,680
I'm the Great Phantom of KHV!

353
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,490
Bye bye virus.

354
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,560
I have things to do, so let's keep this short.

355
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,140
I'm turning on my work mode.

356
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,830
She's heartless once she's like this.

357
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:17,920
Don't underestimate us.

358
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,000
I see. They're viruses, so they can multiply.

359
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,960
Looks like this will be a big task.

360
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,630
Yeah.

361
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:34,790
Then I'll blast the big one, so in the meantime, Sakuya, you handle them.

362
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,540
Huh?

363
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,740
Don't worry. KHV can't infect humans.

364
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,410
SFX: Sparkle

365
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,590
Stop the sparkle! It's not a matter of infecting humans or not!

366
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,660
Besides, you just made a statement, didn't you?

367
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,910
I won't hurt my friends anymore.

368
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,510
You said that!

369
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,740
You're full of energy, so you'll be fine.

370
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,170
You moron! I am pretty sensitive, you know?!

371
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,140
Hey, where did that carp god go?

372
00:17:59,140 --> 00:17:59,560
Oh.

373
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,350
Great Phantom-san, Great Phantom-san.

374
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:08,530
They just said that you're a knockoff of Hyou**zoku's Black ****.

375
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,470
That moron! What's he saying?

376
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,170
We're not knockoffs!

377
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,670
We're inspired by them!

378
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,870
It doesn't matter!

379
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:20,580
Anyway, we won't let you guys live!

380
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,080
I'm cornered in only after a few scene cuts.

381
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,220
It'll be over in two more cuts.

382
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,670
Watch out!

383
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,960
Debt-ridden butler.

384
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,330
Are you all right, Sakuya-san?

385
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,560
That's indeed the Hayate-sama I know.

386
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,430
Wherever there is a person in need of help, you appear like a gust of wind.

387
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,390
Reinforcements, eh?

388
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,510
But what difference is there with one extra kid?

389
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:51,840
Why are these people wearing knockoffs of underling suits?

390
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,460
We're not knockoffs!

391
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,390
So what exactly are these strange people?

392
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,220
They're not people; they're phantoms.

393
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,890
A carp asked Isumi to exterminate them.

394
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,330
Take this!

395
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,070
Super M spread uniting!

396
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,970
I got cornered really quickly, too.

397
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,910
We're in big trouble!

398
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,610
Hachiyou Rokushiki.

399
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,790
Isumi-san?

400
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,590
Away and begone.

401
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,600
What?

402
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,840
Then that strange thing that happened a while back was all Isumi-san?

403
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,850
Please keep it a secret from Nagi.

404
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,730
Let's now go to Nagi's house, shall we?

405
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:08,390
Yes.

406
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,320
And Isumi-san, this way.

407
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,020
Seriously, I can't let my eyes off of her.

408
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,260
No! I don't want to be served alive! I don't want to be soup either!

409
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,570
What? Everything's over?

410
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,150
Yay! Now I can do synchronized swimming again!

411
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,540
Just go do it.

412
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,580
Oh, so you're finally here, Isumi.

413
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,850
Good work, Hayate.

414
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,930
Well, thank you.

415
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,620
Can you get tea for all of us?

416
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,820
Yes, right away.

417
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,590
Hey, can I ask one thing?

418
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:49,600
That last thing, if that was your power, I think you could have won even if I hadn't lured the enemy.

419
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,590
What's the truth there?

420
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,240
I can't tell that to a person who hits others' heads with a paper fan.

421
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,380
So that's what you were getting back at?

422
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,010
You think of me wrongly, Sakuya.

423
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,420
Don't lie to me!

424
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,370
I hate the way you talk!

425
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,450
They get along well, don't they?

426
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,680
They are friends after all.

427
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,790
What the heck! What the heck!

428
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,590
You're no longer my friend!

429
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,330
We're done!

430
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,560
I reject you!

431
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,200
Friends, huh?

432
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,290
You're pretty good, Afro.

433
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,050
You, too, Koi-san.

434
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,830
Friends!

435
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,140
That's right, you have to take care of friends and afro hair.

436
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:40,560
Next time, we'll yet again fight with a familiar looking hot butler.

437
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,860
Carp soup from sashimi I found on the street!

438
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,350
Thanks for the food!

439
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:49,550
I am Nabeshin yay yay ya.

440
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:52,620
An afro looks good on me yay yay ya.

441
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,890
I don't like evil afros!

442
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,960
Nagi and

443
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,000
Hayate and

444
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,190
Nishizawa Ayumu's

445
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,060
Butler Network!

446
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,470
Oo! Ya! Tah! It's Sanzenin Nagi.

447
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,490
It's Ayasakai Hayate.

448
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,560
It's Nishizawa Ayumu.

449
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,200
You've never failed to show up in this anime, Nishizawa-san, but we hardly see each other in the actual show.

450
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,920
Yes. I'm so envious of Sanzenin-chan.

451
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,810
But there seem to be fans of yours out there, so we have a service shot prepared.

452
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,360
It's a super borderline shot.

453
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,220
What? I never heard that!

454
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,930
Hayate-kun, you can't see it!

455
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,170
What?

456
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,660
But we don't have time to show it, so we'll save it for next time.

457
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,850
Bye bye.

458
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,650
Autumn is the season of culture, right?

459
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:09,450
Therefore, next week will be an episode of Hakuou Academy's Culture Festival.

460
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:13,670
We as student council members will do our best to make this festival a success!

461
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,380
Now, Hayata-kun. We leave the rest to you.

462
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,340
O-Okay.

463
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,700
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

464
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,360
Why?! School Festival Part One.

465
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:27,140
Did you know? Pacific saury used to be a fish from which only oil was extracted.
