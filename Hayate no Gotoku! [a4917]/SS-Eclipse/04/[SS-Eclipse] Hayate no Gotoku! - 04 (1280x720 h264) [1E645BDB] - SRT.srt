1
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:09,110
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:09,950
Got it?

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,990
It's spring all of a sudden.

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,000
It feels as if the time flew by.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,970
And, I also feel a third person's intent at work, someone other than God's.

6
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,400
So, how's it going? Got used to living here?

7
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,820
Don't start talking when the episode's just started.

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,510
You'll surprise the NEETs who are just picking up the show with this episode.

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,340
"NEET": An acronym for "Not currently engaged in Employment, Education, or Training"

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,430
Screw them. Think about the kids.

11
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,320
Or what, you have a problem with me?

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,920
I have a B license in real estate and building management, and a license as a boiler worker, too.

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,720
Real estate and building management?

14
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,770
Ah, but don't tell anyone I can talk.

15
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:52,600
You see, if you see me in the world of Pocket *******,
which is now ten years old, I have a Pika***-like role.

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,970
So I must keep the correct image.

17
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,800
You're just one of the random characters,
and you're acting like a mascot character?

18
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,040
Don't tell me you think you have the potential of bringing in billions of economic wealth?

19
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:07,380
What? How dare you call me a random character?

20
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:13,750
In a certain magazine, I ranked twelfth in a popularity contest!

21
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:18,280
Also, in a autograph session in Nagoya,
I was the last one to get the final request!

22
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,590
Milady? This is rare, leaving the mansion grounds.

23
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,590
Hey, listen to me!

24
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,980
I will be back, so wait here for me.

25
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,340
Honestly, I don't want to go.

26
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,250
Where could our Lady be going?

27
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,020
Even the elderly are all over me!

28
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,940
This was the farewell between Hayate and Nagi.

29
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,510
A butler is one who serves.

30
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,980
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

31
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,890
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

32
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,210
Yes.

33
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:54,790
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

34
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,450
Hey! Butler buried in debt! Stop ignoring me!

35
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,670
You bastard!

36
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,030
We have a problem.

37
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:42,470
Maria-san! I just saw Milady go outside somewhere!

38
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,350
Somewhere? She's gone to school.

39
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,230
What's the surprise? No matter how you look at her, she's right around that age.

40
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,250
But, ever since I've come here...

41
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,550
I had assumed she had home schooling.

42
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:02,650
Well, how do I say... She's in a rough state.

43
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,820
Is she a Hikikomori?

44
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,660
Hikikomori: A Japanese term referring to young adults who have chosen to withdraw from social life.

45
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,040
And it's already the middle of April, right?

46
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,560
So the school called in to tell her to come.

47
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:11,820
I see.

48
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,620
Out of curiosity, where does she go?

49
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,790
Hakuou Academy.

50
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,930
Hakuou?!

51
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:22,490
That's that super-famous school with lots of rich people,
going from grade one through twelve!

52
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,120
She is smart, after all.

53
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,110
But what a problem.

54
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,980
And that is?

55
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,350
It's Nagi's lunch.

56
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,460
She left it here.

57
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,400
I'll deliver it.

58
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,250
But...

59
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,010
It's part of my duties as a butler.

60
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,650
This is modern Tokyo, right?

61
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,610
It's probably bigger than Suginami Ward, isn't it?

62
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,970
Sign reads "Hakuou Academy"

63
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,150
Finding Milady in here will be really hard!

64
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,040
I must give it my all.

65
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,840
Hold it.

66
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,960
You're not a student of Hakuou, are you?

67
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,440
Who are you?

68
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,910
Identify yourself!

69
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,130
Are you a teacher here?

70
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,520
Um, I'm Lady Sanzein Nagi's-

71
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,720
Don't lie to me!

72
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,080
You can't possibly be Nagi-chan.

73
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,430
She's breastless, but she still is a girl!

74
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,650
There are limits to the lies you can say and to credit card use!

75
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,540
No, you see, I'm her butler.

76
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,540
Stop making things up!

77
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,380
What an amazing cosmo.

78
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,630
There is no butler out there with a cheap face like yours.

79
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,590
Well, maybe one if you search,

80
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,290
but I've never seen one.

81
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,870
And I don't believe anything I've never seen. You get it?

82
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,050
You got it, right?!

83
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,830
It's my duty to protect this school from suspicious people.

84
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,870
Why you ask? Because I can't have my salary cut any more.

85
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,990
So settle this matter as you being a stranger and get out of here!

86
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,370
I can't do that.

87
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:03,790
I have my duty to take this bento to Milady.

88
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,890
So this is now a fight between each other's duties.

89
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,350
So it seems.

90
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,680
Let's hear your name.

91
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,650
Ayasaki Hayate.

92
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,070
And you are?

93
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,000
I won't give you my name.

94
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,020
Why? Because it's personal information!

95
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:24,240
It's common sense to protect one's personal information nowadays!

96
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,130
So cruel of you.

97
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,940
You fell for it, Ayasaki Hayate.

98
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,800
The battle's already started.

99
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,500
I really don't get it, but you're cheating.

100
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,660
What's going on?

101
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,340
Watching Katsura-chan and thinking how she's doing things again.

102
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,480
Who's that poor-looking boy?

103
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,330
Now, give it up, Ayasaki-kun.

104
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,320
You won't be able to run past me.

105
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,920
The background is suddenly of another dimension!

106
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,010
I-Is this the legendary drunken boxing?

107
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,500
But I think something's wrong.

108
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,810
Anyway, I must walk by her to make my way into the building.

109
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,960
Into the building...

110
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,820
Hey look, I already walked past you.

111
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,320
Crap!

112
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,240
We switched place before I noticed!

113
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,090
You're pretty good.

114
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,260
I'm in a hurry, so bye.

115
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,500
W-Wait! No! That one doesn't count!

116
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,860
You can't find a fool that stops after being told to stop.

117
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,700
Nope.

118
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,340
You girls.

119
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,950
Dear audiences of all ages watching this anime.

120
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,690
Nice to meet you.

121
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,750
I am a student from this school, Hanabishi Miki.

122
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,670
I'm Segawa Izumi.

123
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,450
And I'm Minami Haruo.

124
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,450
Minami Haruo (1923 - 2001): A Japanese enka singer

125
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,590
Sorry, I'm Asakaze Risa.

126
00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:00,020
Don't show up all of a sudden and speak through the CRT screen.

127
00:07:55,730 --> 00:08:00,020
CRT: Cathode Ray Tube

128
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,370
Besides, don't you girls have class?

129
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,930
CRT screen...

130
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,480
Sorry, but I think there's something
we need to worry about more than class.

131
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,550
CRT screen...

132
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,140
Would you like us to help you, Katsura-chan?

133
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,070
Are we in the mid 1900's?

134
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:21,110
Oh no, I ran away due to the habit I developed from
the days I was getting chased by debt collectors, but...

135
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,880
Come to think of it, I'm not a suspicious person at all.

136
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,430
I should walk with more dignity.

137
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:38,200
After all, I am a butler of the Sanzenin family!

138
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,700
What? Where am I?

139
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,870
On a different note, that clock tower is amazing.

140
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,900
Since I've come all the way, I'd like to go up there.

141
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,840
You can't.

142
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:56,950
Only student council members are allowed in the deepest parts of the clock tower.

143
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,560
Wh-Who are you?

144
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,960
Where are you talking to me from?

145
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,450
Over here.

146
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:09,630
What could a Sanzenin family butler be doing here?

147
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,830
Um... And what are you doing up there?

148
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:18,120
You indeed are the butler of the Sanzenin family.
You cut right to the chase.

149
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,210
I see. Tree climbing is the craze in Hakuou Academy right now.

150
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,600
Do I look like I'm playing to you?

151
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,170
But it's dangerous.

152
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,590
I know that without having you tell me!

153
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,050
This is... You know!

154
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:35,060
Trees are actually rough on the surface and, with the aid of branches, are easy to climb,

155
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,760
but if you only look up, you forget about what's below you and...

156
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:43,190
Simply put, you're like a cat that climbed to a high place but can't get down?

157
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,110
Don't simplify it!

158
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,030
It makes it sound like I'm stupid!

159
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,280
Yes, stupid people and smoke like high places,

160
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,940
but I'm not stupid, you hear?!

161
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,600
I never said that.

162
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,480
Well, fine.

163
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,130
If you're a Sanzenin butler, you must be somewhat athletic.

164
00:09:59,130 --> 00:09:59,890
Eh?

165
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,680
Come to think of, how does she know that I'm the Sanzenin's new butler?

166
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,990
In any case, I have a little favor to ask of you.

167
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,630
A favor?

168
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,520
So... Well... Um...

169
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,030
C...

170
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,230
Catch me, okay?

171
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,010
Sorry, are you all right?

172
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,380
Y-Yes, somehow.

173
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,780
It's dangerous if you don't catch me properly.

174
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,170
If you think it's dangerous,
then please don't jump in the first place.

175
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,530
I'm sorry.

176
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,390
But you don't have to yell at me like that.

177
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,300
I was really scared up there,
and I wanted to get down as soon as possible.

178
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,260
I'm scared of heights, too.

179
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,280
Well, okay.

180
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,730
But either way, it wasn't very graceful.

181
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,180
Girls shouldn't do that with a skirt on.

182
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,340
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.

183
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,470
I'm wearing sports pants underneath.

184
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,850
Wh-What are you doing?!

185
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,570
Girls should have more modesty.

186
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,940
What's with that innocent act?

187
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,570
Could the butlers in Sanzenin have
the minds of grade school children?

188
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,590
F-Fooling around with me like that...

189
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:19,160
Besides, if you'd waited, I would have gone up to help you without you having to jump.

190
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,860
Oh, so you'll help me if I call for you?

191
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:29,370
Ah, come to think of, why were you up there if you're scared of heights?

192
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:34,470
I had no choice. She fell from the nest and was crying.

193
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,990
You climbed a tree you couldn't get off for that reason?

194
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,680
What, are you going to make fun of me again?

195
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,310
No. I was thinking how kind you are.

196
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,020
I'm sorry for all the rude comments.

197
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,720
It's fine as long as you understand.

198
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,860
But now that chick can be at ease and-

199
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,570
Ahh, what is that crow doing?

200
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,590
You can't! You'll hit the chick with that!

201
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,810
Look!

202
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,170
It's the parents!

203
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,110
Beautiful parental love is about to save the chick!

204
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,390
What? You're going to abandon her?

205
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:24,050
A mother and father should never abandon their child!

206
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,970
Mr. Crow, can you back off now?

207
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,400
Or else, next time, I'll have to hit you.

208
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:46,360
So you tell me not to throw anything, but then you do?

209
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,050
I have a good control.

210
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,080
What do you mean by that?

211
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,020
You make it sound as if I have no control.

212
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,150
Besides you're-

213
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,070
It's Hayate.

214
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,740
My name is Ayasaki Hayate.

215
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,490
And you are?

216
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,660
I'm...

217
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,200
Why does youth make you hungry?

218
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,870
What is this cute girl's name?

219
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,840
With mystery and dubiety left, we'll move on to part B.

220
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,060
Nori.

221
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,060
Nori = Seaweed

222
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,820
Rinpa.

223
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,820
Rinpa = Lymph

224
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,220
Hayate is?

225
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:34,540
Yes, he should have gone there. Have you not met him yet?

226
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,200
Well this school is as big as Vana'****.

227
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:44,160
But I see. Hayate is here to bring my lunch filled with love...

228
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,550
Okay, don't worry. I will make sure to get ahold of his love.

229
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,040
Um, I'm the one who made it...

230
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,220
But, where and what could Hayate-kun be doing?

231
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,120
I see, so your name is Katsura Hinagiku.

232
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,730
That's a nice name.

233
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:03,960
You think so?

234
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,560
How about, as a token of my thanks,
would you like me to take you up there?

235
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,740
But I thought only student council members were allowed there.

236
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,000
Don't worry. I'm the student council president.

237
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,700
Really, what kind of an idiot placed
the student council room so high up?

238
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,340
I see.

239
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,650
But Katsura-san, you're scared of heights, right?

240
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:29,150
I'm fine. I'm happy enough to be able to see it so close.

241
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,110
But you said you wanted to go up it once.

242
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:35,150
Then you'll be even more satisfied if you do go up.

243
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,060
I suppose, but...

244
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,020
Then don't waste your chance.

245
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,890
It's my "thank you" gift.

246
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,370
Ayasaki-kun, if you don't become a little bit more selfish,
you won't catch your happiness.

247
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:53,080
But really, how stupid could one be to place the student council room so high up?

248
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,240
She reminds me of Lady Nagi.

249
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:02,350
Now let's go. I'm the student council president,
so it's not like I've never went up, so don't worry about me.

250
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,370
A-All right...

251
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,250
If you're a guy, be more articulate.

252
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,350
Yes!

253
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,660
Is that really an intruder?

254
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,790
Maybe it really was a Sanzenin family butler.

255
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,210
Don't talk like you know it all.

256
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:20,290
What would a boring single teacher who makes Gun**** at school understand?

257
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,100
Oh no, my parts!

258
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:28,100
Listen. It doesn't matter if he's really an intruder or not.

259
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,150
It's a fact that Hakuou allowed someone we don't know in!

260
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:36,450
Unless we catch him, our fame for security is down the drain!

261
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,400
She's copying off of us.

262
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,080
She's a teacher, and yet we need to keep an eye on her.

263
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,240
You do see the problem when that happens, right?

264
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,390
You do, right?

265
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:43,310
Especially my salary, since I let him in!

266
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,090
Who are you three talking to?

267
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,580
Okay, Segawa-san, you search though the inside the school building.

268
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,360
Hanabishi-san, you check around the gym.

269
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,480
Asakaze-san, you check...

270
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,810
Just look around somewhere.

271
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,060
Take Yasu with you!

272
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,640
Yasu? Who's that?

273
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,590
Roger.

274
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So we are really going to do this?

275
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,540
I'll start off by getting a bird's eye view.

276
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,300
It's an amazing panorama!

277
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,190
Isn't it something?

278
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:15,160
The view from this clock tower is indescribable.

279
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,560
It's so wonderful you forget to blink, isn't it?

280
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,090
You can't see it if you're inside.

281
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,600
Don't worry about me. I'm seeing it through my mind's eye.

282
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,340
But from up here, you can see what goes on in the campus really well.

283
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:34,210
Of course. The reason why the student council room is so high up is for us to be able to observe the students.

284
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,910
You take a look at the students from here often?

285
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:40,730
I listen to people rather than look at them.

286
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,340
But this really is...

287
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,020
School looks like so much fun.

288
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,990
Oh, come to think of, it's the middle of the class now. Is it fine for you to be here?

289
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,520
Katsura-san?

290
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,310
Oh, be quiet.

291
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:03,170
Classes started while I was saving Cha-bou, so don't blame me!

292
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,400
Um, who's Cha-bou?

293
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,150
That chick we saved earlier.

294
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,810
It's a brown sparrow, so Cha-bou.

295
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,810
Cha-bou: Literally "brown child"

296
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,320
Wow, so simple.

297
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,320
Wh-What? In anime, it's important
to make things easy to understand!

298
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,300
I have to take the bento to Milady now.

299
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,790
Now I know where the cafeteria is, too.

300
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:33,290
Thank you very much. I was able to see a view I'll never forget.

301
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,130
You sound as though you'll never come here again.

302
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,030
I'll never be able to come here again, Katsura-san.

303
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,470
Call me Hinagiku.

304
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,200
There's another Katsura on campus who stands out more than me, so everyone calls me by my given name.

305
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,010
So call me Hinagiku.

306
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,950
Got it, Ayasaki Hayate-kun?

307
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,020
I found you, intruder!

308
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,460
Y-You're...

309
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,330
Onee-chan!

310
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,380
Onee-chan?

311
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,960
Yup, Yukiji Onee-chan.

312
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,340
Intruder, your life ends here!

313
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,780
But, of course, you're not really going to die.

314
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,810
Ah, yes, right, I probably won't.

315
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,480
Anyway, time to destroy you.

316
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,350
Hold on, he's not an intruder or anythi-

317
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,040
Shut up! I already explained to the people watching this show that that doesn't matter anymore!

318
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:29,850
Slay!

319
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,560
Evil!

320
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,520
Immediately!

321
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,530
Prepare yourself!

322
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,130
Hina.

323
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,080
There you go uttering nonsense again.

324
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,460
You've gotten better.

325
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,470
But you can't stop your sister's passion at your level yet!

326
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,540
Nor can you stop my salary from dropping!

327
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:57,520
Yeah right. I've never lost in a fight against you.

328
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,220
The only thing I lose to you is your wastefully spent life.

329
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:05,560
Even if you're my little sister, I won't forgive you for that, Hina!

330
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,440
Um, both of you...

331
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,580
When will the twenty thousand yen I lent you last month be coming back to me?

332
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,640
You coward! Taking Yukichi as a hostage?!

333
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,600
Yukichi: The person whose portrait appears on the ten-thousand yen bill.

334
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,600
I am not!

335
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,800
Um, I need to deliver this bento to Milady...

336
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,640
Yukichi's an important figure, you know?!
His "Talking Scholarly" sold over 3.4 million copies!

337
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,810
I could care less!

338
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,110
It's mine!

339
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,350
Onee-chan!

340
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,600
Hina, do you want this back?

341
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,990
But can you come all the way here when you're scared of heights?

342
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:41,040
If you can't come, then give that intruder to me and forget about the twenty thousand yen.

343
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,060
Hinagiku-san.

344
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,700
Don't mock me, Onee-chan.

345
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,600
I'm the student council president of
Hakuou Academy, Katsura Hinagiku.

346
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,970
I will not forgive you for treating my guest as an intruder!

347
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,450
You sure are my sister.

348
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,530
Then I'll-

349
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,890
Onee-chan!

350
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,760
Really, it's dangerous of you to get up on such a place.

351
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,770
The Sanzenin family's butlers are amazing.

352
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,770
So you finally believe me?

353
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,360
Well, yeah.

354
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,350
Thank you for saving my sister, Hayate-kun.

355
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,160
It was nothing. I'm glad the confusion got resolved.

356
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,880
I need to take the bento to Milady now, so...

357
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,410
Sorry, I threw it without thinking.

358
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:00,010
What should I do? I'll get fired.

359
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,820
Don't worry. I'll apologize to Nagi.

360
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,330
Okay?

361
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,990
Y-Yeah, I'll apologize, too, maybe.

362
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,940
Yeah.

363
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,350
What are you doing?

364
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,150
Milady.

365
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,150
Nagi! There's a long story behind this.

366
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,220
I can guess.

367
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:17,160
I bet Sensei stole the bento,

368
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,320
and then stood on top of the railing with the bento in hand.

369
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,690
Then a gust of wind blew, and Hayate saved her as she was about to fall,

370
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,280
and instead, the bento became the sacrifice.

371
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,930
Am I right?

372
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,450
U-Unbelievable observation.

373
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:33,840
The result was a failure, but thank you for coming so far for me, Hayate.

374
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,840
Milady!

375
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:44,130
I'm hungry, so this is perfect. Let's go home, Hayate.

376
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:48,240
You can't, Milady. You have to attend afternoon classes, too.

377
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,610
But I'm hungry.

378
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,710
I'll deliver another one at light speed.

379
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,760
But that won't let me ditch class!

380
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,850
Studying is important.

381
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,580
You were crying until just a moment ago!

382
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,130
But this is my duty as your butler.

383
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:06,050
I need to have you study hard and become a wonderful lady.

384
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,050
Ayasaki Hayate, eh?

385
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,170
But-

386
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,720
Sneaking into Hakuou Academy is now over.

387
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,710
Next time, we'll fight against the comedy boom!

388
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,460
Intruder!

389
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,700
We're looking for him so hard.

390
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,350
What fast legs he has.

391
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:21,060
But thanks to him, we're able to skip class with a legitimate excuse.

392
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,190
Thanks to the intruder.

393
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,820
Such great weather again.

394
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:07,440
If the weather keeps up,
maybe it'll be summer by the time Golden Week ends.

395
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,030
As if, right?

396
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,960
Of course not, you fool!

397
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,560
Looks like you found a good comedian, Nagi.

398
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,170
He's a butler.

399
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,210
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

400
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,570
Unneeded Gags and Kindness Bring Misfortune.

401
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:25,710
I was told not to talk with people I don't know, yet I'm talking...

402
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,050
This one will be awesome!
