1
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:05,400
When watching TV,

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,940
make sure the room is well lit,

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,000
and watch from a distance.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,020
Got it?

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,730
Here, Kuzuha-sama.

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:16,890
Say "Ahh..."

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:17,930
Ahh.

8
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,300
Our school's butler field rating has...

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,440
...Dropped by three points.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,890
They're slacking.

11
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,440
A butler shall stand firm even after getting run over by a car speeding at 80km/h,

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,080
or even after getting stepped on by a giant robot.

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,980
Excuse me, you have cream on by your lip.

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,190
They only deserve to be called professionals when they can do those.

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,420
Am I not right, Shion?

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,210
Yes, you are.

17
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,030
But still...

18
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,430
Let's see...

19
00:00:54,430 --> 00:01:02,250
If a butler with a poor man's face that makes me want to hit him,
in his late teens, 168cm tall, and about 57kg existed somewhere...

20
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,170
If one existed...

21
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,150
I wouldn't mind having some fun with him.

22
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,190
It's autumn.

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,650
It sure is.

24
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,830
Tama, stop it.

25
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,800
Hey, stop it.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,310
I get the feeling someone, somewhere, is calling for me.

27
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,050
Let's get the new one going, shall we?

28
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,550
One who masters being a butler becomes the master of the world.

29
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:52,920
The Butler War that shakes the planet has started!

30
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,230
Yes! I just came up with a great pastime.

31
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,930
Um, who are you?

32
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,690
I've done it. It's finally complete.

33
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,630
Congratulations.

34
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,600
I'm sure you'll get the rookie award this time.

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,880
Y-Yeah.

36
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,870
Then... take this manuscript...

37
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,660
Yes, I will send it to the publisher.

38
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:57,310
And, when you got to school, bring my *S* back from my desk.

39
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,170
You left something behind?

40
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,490
I left C**sis Core in it.

41
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,420
So, thanks.

42
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,800
Milady, please get a good rest.

43
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,770
Yeah...

44
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,700
It's a normal, peaceful day.

45
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,950
Although it's a bit of a shame that Milady couldn't come with me.

46
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,280
Good morning, Hayate-kun.

47
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,580
Hinagiku-san.

48
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,720
Are you by yourself?

49
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,240
Is Nagi skipping again?

50
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,420
Well, yes.

51
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,330
Good morning, fellow students of Hakuou Academy.

52
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,100
I have an announcement.

53
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,710
This voice is-

54
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,590
Hinagiku-san, look!

55
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,840
Just so you know, this is not a joke.

56
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,970
I'm serious.

57
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,570
What is this?

58
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,740
She's planning on doing something stupid again!

59
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,440
Wait!

60
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,330
What's this?

61
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,910
Sh-Shine!

62
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,930
The First...

63
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,160
...Hakuou Academy...

64
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,120
...Butler...

65
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,110
...Battle...

66
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,030
...Tournament.

67
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,930
Hinagiku-san.

68
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,450
Um, please calm down.

69
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,240
What's going on?

70
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,180
Stand back, Hayate-kun.

71
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,010
I'm surprised you found me.

72
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,470
You indeed are the school's Student Council President.

73
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,610
Um, who is she?

74
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,570
She's this school's superintendent.

75
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,110
S-Superintendent?

76
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,890
That's me.

77
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,020
What is this?!

78
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,370
Butler Battle Tournament? It doesn't make any sense!

79
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,360
It's as you see.

80
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,230
I wanted to test the levels of the butlers we have on campus.

81
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,380
And I also have a personal interest, too.

82
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,810
A butler who's strong, tough, and worth playing with.

83
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,280
I'm looking for someone like that.

84
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,810
I... I felt a chill down my back.

85
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,090
Anyways, she seems like a really wild person.

86
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:23,160
So basically, you want to make
the students toys and play with them!

87
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,600
"Play" you say?

88
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,630
Power levels are one of the most important aspects looked for in butlers.

89
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:34,650
But the butlers in this school are all diligent students.

90
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,140
For example, we have Hayate-kun here.

91
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,790
I see.

92
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,880
Then I'll ask him directly.

93
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:50,560
What? Have I been made
the center of attention without knowing it?

94
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,620
Boy.

95
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,460
From the looks of it, you're a butler, too.

96
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,650
Answer my question.

97
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,360
Yes.

98
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,850
A battle tournament to measure
the butlers' strength is meaningless.

99
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,710
Yes or No?

100
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,460
U-Um...

101
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:06,920
Tick

102
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:07,990
Tick

103
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,090
Tick

104
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:15,020
I won't call it "meaningless",
but aren't there more important things?

105
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,520
Like a caring heart towards one's master.

106
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,120
You don't understand anything, boy!

107
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,230
Hayate-kun, use this!

108
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,360
Not too bad.

109
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,870
Don't drag me into the battle world.

110
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:40,610
But, you're nowhere near strong enough!!!

111
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,520
What should I do? This is my fault.

112
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:57,490
A butler is the person who must protect
their master even at the cost of their life.

113
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,700
Boy, what would you do if I were someone after your master's life?

114
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:10,440
Can you still say that strength is meaningless to a butler?

115
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,700
That's...

116
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,070
An opening!

117
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,240
Educational guidance!

118
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,350
Watch out!

119
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,160
Her battery ran out.

120
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,610
No... My blood sugar level...

121
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,080
Sh-Shion...

122
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,930
S... Snacks...

123
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,380
Yes, I have them ready in your office.

124
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,450
Are they sweet?

125
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,270
Yes, very.

126
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,720
Shion.

127
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,740
Kuzuha-sama.

128
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,070
No~

129
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,480
What is wrong with these people?

130
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,010
Allow me to explain.

131
00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:00,040
Hakuou Academy's Superintendent, Kuzuha Kirika,
possesses a power level three times that of an ordinary person,

132
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,920
however the moment she uses up her energy, she drops to the floor.

133
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,830
How dare you do this to my dear Kuzuha-sama.

134
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,280
I won't forgive you.

135
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,580
What?

136
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,430
This is all my fault?

137
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,000
What?

138
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,900
Could this be a territory created by her aura?

139
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,920
My name is Shion.

140
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,220
The kanji goes "poem" "sound".

141
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,200
And you read it as "Shion".

142
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,690
I-I see.

143
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,050
I'm-

144
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,610
She's good.

145
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,910
She took away my freedom of movement instantaneously.

146
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:47,430
The world's coming to an end for the likes of you to be a butler.

147
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,170
You're so weak.

148
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,220
How about you quit being a butler and become a maid instead?

149
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,880
It's more fitting for you.

150
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,440
If it's frustrating, then come to the tournament.

151
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,590
The winner receives the right to challenge me.

152
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,220
But then, I'm sure it's impossible for you.

153
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,990
Um, Hayate-kun.

154
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,300
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.

155
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,910
It's fine.

156
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,940
Um!

157
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,080
Will you act like... that... never happened?

158
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,380
O-Okay.

159
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,010
What's with this flow?

160
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,670
Butler Battle Tournament?

161
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,450
Um, I have something I want to ask.

162
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,410
The superintendent of Hakuou Academy... what is she like?

163
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,830
And is there something between her and Hinagiku-san?

164
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,930
Oh, you met her?

165
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,370
Y-Yes.

166
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,090
That superintendent is a real problem-causing character.

167
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:08,100
Like changing the field trip site to the Amazon just
to kill her boredom. Mind you, not Amazon on the 'net.

168
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,430
Another time, again to kill her boredom, she tried to put a ****k in the pool.

169
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,390
I see...

170
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:22,390
So just like that, Hinagiku is trying to protect the students and the world from the evil superintendent's hand.

171
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,220
W-Wait!

172
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,740
That last cut was...

173
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,530
I won't say much.

174
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:33,260
It's best that you stay away from
the superintendent and her butler.

175
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,800
But, Butler Battle Tournament, eh? That came out of nowhere.

176
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,110
Let's see.

177
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:42,600
The winner gets a hundred credits as the prize?

178
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,740
So basically the winner can skip school all they want.

179
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:55,850
Hayate, why don't you try competing in this battle?

180
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,100
What? You're not trying to get-

181
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,370
No, I don't care about the hundred credits.

182
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:05,200
Whatever happens, I'll skip when I feel like it.

183
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,100
Rather than that, Hayate...

184
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,350
I want to see you win the tournament with my own eyes.

185
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,420
W-Win the tournament, you say?

186
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:22,690
Yes! Since Sanzenin butlers have to be invincible.

187
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:23,760
In other words,

188
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,760
you're invincible!

189
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:25,920
Invincible!

190
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,860
Therefore you'll win!

191
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,610
Milady...

192
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,500
Things are heating up.

193
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,200
I bet you can do this.

194
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,670
Or this.

195
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,000
You can do all sorts of stuff.

196
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,190
And I don't have the chance to see them that often.

197
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:47,810
Um, so judging from the flow,
I have to go to the tournament no matter what?

198
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,690
But, if Milady has such high hopes in me...

199
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,010
Katsura Hinagiku-kun.

200
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,640
This is a warning.

201
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,700
You're only a commoner without a butler, after all.

202
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,600
You're better off not butting in and staying out of this matter.

203
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:13,320
I found it in the Student Council's drop box.

204
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,630
For your information, the exterior was initially sticky from black honey.

205
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,160
I see. So she had a Japanese pastry for her snack today.

206
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,080
Note: This is a pun - Japanese pastry (Wagashi) versus My Master (Waga shi)

207
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,390
We don't care about that!

208
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:30,420
Is there any way to intervene in this tournament?

209
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,830
But I don't have a butler...

210
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,950
What should I do?

211
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,970
I know what I'm doing.

212
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,730
I'll ask Kotetsu-kun for a favor.

213
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,940
Lucky to actually have a butler.

214
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,590
Yes, the hundred credits are appealing.

215
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,180
What should Miki and I do?

216
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:53,260
You there! Don't be lured by evil's temptation.

217
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:56,350
Hina.

218
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,010
I have an idea.

219
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,760
Um, I think you should stay out of danger.

220
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,650
No, I've made up my mind.

221
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,830
Maria-san, I will enter the Butler Battle Tournament.

222
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,770
I can't betray Milady's expectations.

223
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,070
All right, I'm on fire now.

224
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,010
I will choose to go with the flow!

225
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:26,680
H-His simplicity doesn't change even if it goes into a dashing storyline.

226
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,560
What will butler Hayate's destiny be?

227
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,920
And, the day of the tournament has come already.

228
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,070
Bushi ni nigon ha nai.

229
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,070
Bushi ni nigon ha nai. = A samurai does not take back his words.

230
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,860
Ichido shineba nido shinanu.

231
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,860
Ichido shineba nido shinanu. = Die once, and you'll never die again.

232
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,560
I-Is that fire?

233
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:59,410
We will now start the
"Shine! The First Butler Battle Tournament!"

234
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,040
I am the superintendent of this school, Kuzuha Kirika.

235
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,000
Fight, everyone!

236
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,590
Compete!

237
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,820
I'm counting on you all for a fight that's not shameful as butlers!

238
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,650
It's finally the day, Hayate.

239
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,750
Yes.

240
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,850
I'll make it to you, Poem-person.

241
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,020
We will now start the first match!

242
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,490
In the red corner!

243
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,970
Butler of the Something-or-Another family!

244
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,400
Extra One!

245
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,770
In the blue corner!

246
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,280
Butler of the Segawa Family!

247
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,950
Kotetsu!

248
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,400
I never knew our class president had a butler.

249
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,700
I don't see anyone coming out.

250
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,400
I asked him so many times, too!

251
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,400
Farewell, Urakari Railway.

252
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,880
I can't get enough of this round body.

253
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,110
Right? Right? Don't you agree?

254
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,850
W-Winner, red corner!

255
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,380
Don't make fun of me!

256
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,590
Moving to the second match.

257
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,270
Hey, Ayasaki! You're competing, too?

258
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,790
O-One of the very kind people?

259
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,960
Why are they here?

260
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,250
I hired him as my temporary butler.

261
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,600
Asakaze-san.

262
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,260
I lost to Miki in janken.

263
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,240
So I used my connections.

264
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,770
What kind of connections?

265
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:44,440
Janken?

266
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,680
Fight!

267
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,940
Kill that guy!

268
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,890
Give 'em a lesson!

269
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,250
I-I give up!

270
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,710
Please! Keep that hidden!

271
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,250
Allow me to explain.

272
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,920
A butler's soul is his necktie.

273
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:13,210
Regardless of the amount of damage,
the butler who has his necktie taken away loses.

274
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:18,450
W-Winner, the Asakaze butler, Kashiwagi!

275
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:22,320
S-So his name was Kashiwagi-san.

276
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,870
But...

277
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:28,110
Well done. Keep it up and get the hundred credits for me.

278
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,330
I'll do what I'm paid for.

279
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,740
SFX: Giggle

280
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,580
So dark.

281
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,730
Something is really dark.

282
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,550
Next is the third match.

283
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,370
In the red corner, the Azumamiya family butler.

284
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,440
Nonohara Kaede!

285
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,100
Nonohara! Win this tournament!

286
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,100
Get the hundred credits!

287
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,400
Fight! Go!

288
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,750
Nonohara-san.

289
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,230
And he's facing...

290
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,070
It's me.

291
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,640
Hanabishi family's temporary butler!

292
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,810
Katsura Hinagiku!

293
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,550
Wh-Why is Hinagiku-san here?

294
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,430
A-A butler?

295
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:32,120
That's because I gained the right to negotiate by winning in janken against Risa.

296
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,090
Hina wants to fight against the superintendent.

297
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,810
I want to get the hundred credits.

298
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,470
You can call it a consensus over motivation.

299
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,700
We practically have the victory.

300
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,070
My my, a temporary butler, are you?

301
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,710
Our profession really has been looked down upon.

302
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,610
I'm sorry if I insulted you.

303
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:58,380
But I didn't enter to belittle the event.

304
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,290
Then let's get this started!

305
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,420
Yes.

306
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,960
W-Wow.

307
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,700
You're pretty good.

308
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,780
You're really laidback, Nonohara-san.

309
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,910
Why aren't you using your ultimate move?

310
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,850
Th-That's because...

311
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,620
Nonohara! Win!

312
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,320
Get the hundred credits!

313
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,640
But don't hit Katsura-san!

314
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,390
No matter how strong your attacks may be,

315
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:48,000
I, Katsura Hinagiku, will do whatever it takes to evade them!

316
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,010
Very well.

317
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,140
Then here I go.

318
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:01,010
Safety Shutter!

319
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,020
I won't lose!

320
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,960
What's wrong? Is that all?

321
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,060
Safety-

322
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:25,970
Nonohara-san, your move takes
a little too much time to get going.

323
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,820
Looks like I win.

324
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:35,750
W-Winner, Katsura Hinagiku!

325
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:42,010
Thank you for not going easy just because I'm a girl.

326
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:46,400
No matter who it is, it's a butler's duty to fight them seriously.

327
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,360
Besides,

328
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,000
my master doesn't wish for me to win against you.

329
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,210
Nonohara-san.

330
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,110
How's that?!

331
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:00,070
I'm a step closer to where you are!

332
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,460
So good.

333
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,110
Yes, very good.

334
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,090
Hinagiku-san.

335
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,280
And Hayate's turn is here.

336
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,170
All right, the next match.

337
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,750
In the red corner, the Sanzenin family's butler,

338
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,850
Ayasaki Hayate!

339
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,020
All right, let's do this.

340
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,090
And who's my opponent?

341
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,650
In the blue corner!

342
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,410
Who could be under the mask?

343
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,070
The Mystery Butler!

344
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,480
Unauthorized K!

345
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,260
Who could it be? I sense a master's aura.

346
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,190
Yeah. And he even has a tiger with him.

347
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,150
Who could he be?

348
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,590
No clue.

349
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,120
But don't let your guard down, Hayate.

350
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,430
Who could this mysterious butler and the tiger be?

351
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:54,350
Next week, we'll fight against a crisis.

352
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:30,820
Nagi and...

353
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,170
Hayate's...

354
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,910
Butler Network!

355
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,470
'morning. It's Sanzenin Nagi.

356
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,800
I'm Ayasaki Hayate.

357
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,120
Starting today, the opening and the ending are brand new, giving us a fresh start.

358
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,900
You're right, Milady.

359
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,430
We should be able to go for another half a year.

360
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,960
I had a lot of worry in my head, but things do work out.

361
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,990
Not really.

About the new opening, theme.
The theme is as large as the galaxy.

364
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,000
You think?

365
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,920
Of course, it's a pretty good song.

373
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,270
Will he be able to stand to the last?

374
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,610
I have something I must protect.

375
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:22,640
Hayate.

378
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:29,400
When crossing a crosswalk, make sure to look both ways even when it's green.
