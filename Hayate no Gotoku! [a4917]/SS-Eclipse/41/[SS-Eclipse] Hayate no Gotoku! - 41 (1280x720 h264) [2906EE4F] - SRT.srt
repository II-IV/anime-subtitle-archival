1
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:09,920
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,090
We'll be going now, Maria-san.

3
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,770
Have a good day.

4
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:18,810
Oh yeah, Maria.

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,060
If you have time, can you rent these DVDs from Wataru's place?

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,310
I will. It's cold today, so take care of yourself.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,670
No worries. The battle plan is already made.

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,670
It really is cold today.

9
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,880
Huh? Where's Milady?

10
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,640
Hey, eyes front! The wind will hit me directly, otherwise!

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,680
What?

12
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,530
You're very clever, Milady.

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,470
Good morning, Hinagiku-san.

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,680
What's wrong with you, spacing out like that?

15
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,200
Hinagiku-san!

16
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,270
I'm sorry. Something was on my mind.

17
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,750
Could it be that the Superintendent, the walking hazard producer, started something again?

18
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,920
Oh no. The Superintendent should be down on a southern island, enjoying her vacation.

19
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,600
Kuzuha-sama, say "Ah..."

20
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,700
We didn't have to come all the way here just to eat rice cakes, did we?

21
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,080
It's for the sake of good luck.

22
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,550
Th-Then what could be bothering you?

23
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,000
Well, Onee-chan gave me a New Year's allowance.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,060
WHAT?!

25
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,890
Katsura-sensei gave you a New Year's allowance?

26
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,970
She came over yesterday and left this on my desk.

27
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,400
Although, there was only ¥500 inside.

28
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,030
¥500?

29
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,030
Oh, that little?

30
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,670
That's a fortune!

31
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,320
I've only gotten azuki beans or peanuts.

32
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,250
Good morning!

33
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,480
Hey there. If you chitchat too long, you'll be late to school.

34
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,900
I'm going to arrest you, you know.

35
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,110
Bad boy.

36
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,920
Sh-She's totally different from usual!

37
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:26,160
Did you all know there's a huge mansion like this in the middle of Tokyo?

38
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,750
The name of the mistress who lives there is Sanzenin Nagi.

39
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,660
And...

40
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,630
Her butler's name is Ayasaki Hayate.

41
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,630
The two are slightly airheaded...

42
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,040
...and they misunderstand each other a bit...

43
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,190
...but are bound by a tight master-butler bond.

44
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,450
K-Katsura-sensei is acting differently than usual!

45
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,910
She looks dazzling.

46
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,750
What happened to you, Onee-chan?

47
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,080
What's wrong, you three?

48
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,160
No, how should I put it...

49
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,590
Your total change is getting to us.

50
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:39,090
Did you perhaps eat grass
from the turf or a laughing mushroom?

51
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,750
Why do you ask that?

52
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,290
"Why?" Obviously that's because...

53
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:49,200
It's just... It's just that today's a very special day for me.

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,370
Special day?

55
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,780
The morning staff meeting is coming up soon, so I'll see you later.

56
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,120
This is...

57
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,420
Katsura-chan's quitting?

58
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,970
Yes. That seems to be the case.

59
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,360
What should we do?

60
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,630
What's so funny?

61
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,290
Because that's totally impossible.

62
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,980
Yukiji would never quit being a teacher.

63
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,100
Yeah. Where would she live if she quits from here?

64
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,490
But she's been acting strangely since this morning,

65
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,460
and she said today's a special day or something,

66
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,830
and she even gave Hinagiku-san a New Year's allowance.

67
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,280
Maybe she's planning to quit from Hakuou
and go somewhere far away.

68
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,270
No way!

69
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,720
If what you said is true, I'll go shave my head.

70
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,380
I'll change my name to Men Taiko.

71
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,380
Mentaiko = Spicy egg roe

72
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,820
Then I'll change this anime's title to Yamabiko no Gotoku!

73
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,820
Yamabiko = The echo you hear back in the mountains

74
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,030
You have no right to!

75
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,530
But, if you actually saw her letter of resignation, then I'd be convinced.

76
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,640
Exactly.

77
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,530
N-No way!

78
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,200
It was true?!

79
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,650
If you had picked it up, you should have said so!

80
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,340
Katsura-chan!

81
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,210
Hey, do you need something?

82
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,810
You're not going to call it quits as a teacher, are you?

83
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,830
It's a prank, right?

84
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,000
Tell us it's a joke!

85
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,970
Yeah, calling it quits.

86
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,280
Are you serious?

87
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,180
Yes. Today's the last day.

88
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,250
Today?! Isn't that too sudden?

89
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,510
I'm sorry. It was a little hard to bring it up with you all.

90
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,590
You're joking right, Onee-chan?

91
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,830
Hina.

92
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,740
What is there to do after one quits being a teacher?

93
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,530
There are plenty of things to do out there.

94
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,070
Go on a journey or even start a new life.

95
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,970
Why? Why did you not tell such an important thing to anyone?

96
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,520
She's right, Katsura-chan. You're being such a stranger.

97
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

98
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,870
Why didn't you even ask for a little advice?

99
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,710
I'm a fully-grown adult, so why should I come looking for advice for something like this?

100
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:19,040
Don't worry. It's a conclusion that was reached after much thought.

101
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,330
Katsura-sensei!

102
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,620
I apologize for surprising you all.

103
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,420
But...

104
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:31,880
Goodbyes come suddenly and unannounced.

105
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:37,240
Sadly, life is filled with sudden goodbyes.

106
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,270
You'd never find dandelions in the winter.

107
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,880
Oh Marilla, when you're truly sad, tears don't come, do they?

108
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,880
Sudden goodbyes...

109
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,710
But in exchange, I'll never leave you.

110
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,340
I'm sorry, Matthew.

111
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,440
But not a single tear is coming out.

112
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,730
You idiot, Onee-chan!

113
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,910
I don't care about you!

114
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,530
You can go die on the street of nowhere!

115
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,140
H-Hinagiku-san!

116
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,170
Hina...

117
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,770
Hina. It's about time you came home.

118
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,340
Hey, look at how much New Year's allowance I got.

119
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,860
I got some, too.

120
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,080
This is from Daddy, and this is Mommy.

121
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,020
This is from Grandma, and this is Grandpa.

122
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,950
Hina.

123
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,400
Oh, Onee-chan.

124
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,330
I just remembered that I haven't given you your New Year's allowance yet.

125
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,570
Stick your hand out.

126
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:09,890
Here.

127
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,160
You'll have to let me off the hook with that this year.

128
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:22,920
But in exchange, I'll never leave you.

129
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,040
Really?

130
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,340
Of course, full course!

131
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,480
I'll give you a piggy back ride, so let's go home.

132
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,350
Yup!

133
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,900
Onee-chan, you liar!

134
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,840
Rukkorasetto.

135
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,840
Rukkorasetto = Up I go.

136
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,810
Toshi niha katenai none.

137
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,810
Toshi niha katenai none = Looks like you can't beat growing up.

138
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,840
I never thought Katsura-chan would really quit.

139
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,630
I still can't believe it.

140
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,890
Despite everything we've done to her,
she's taken care of us a lot.

141
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,100
How do we fight against homework and tests from now on?

142
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,520
Looks like everyone's very shocked.

143
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,170
But there's something I don't understand.

144
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,270
This is too much to be one of her spur of the moment things.

145
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:29,600
Yes, but the truth is the truth.

146
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,790
I wish I could attend one more of her world history classes.

147
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,780
Yeah, yeah.

148
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:43,790
Right, the next homeroom period will be the goodbye with Katsura-sensei.

149
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,630
Oh yeah, homeroom!

150
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,800
We'll now start the homeroom period.

151
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,200
Let's see, today's agenda is...

152
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,290
Yes! Katsura-sensei!

153
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:05,500
I have a question regarding the rise and fall of the Frankish Empire, so could you give a lecture?

154
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:10,520
I request the Reconquista events that happened in Spain during the Middle Ages.

155
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,120
What were the four historically important apples?

156
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,990
Is it true Pythagoras was allergic to horse beans?

157
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,650
Is it true that an Englishman invented the ready-made curry pack?

158
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,070
We have so many more questions, so please answer them all.

159
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,280
You guys...

160
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,330
All right, you got it!

161
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,490
Yay!

162
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,940
We've got to enjoy Yukiji's last class.

163
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,840
Listen, this is an important part.

164
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,790
1806, Continental Blockade!

165
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,740
Make sure you remember it.

166
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,720
Katsura-sensei's lecture goes at a good tempo as usual.

167
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,620
She looks like a she doesn't have herself together, but she's actually good at teaching.

168
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,020
By the way, did you know that Napoleon was into fortune telling.

169
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,370
She even tells us things you don't learn from textbooks.

170
00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:00,780
It's a simple thing where you hold a coin
in your left hand and flip a crepe in the frying pan.

171
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,770
He did that five times and failed the fifth one.

172
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:08,750
This was in 1812. The year the French invasion of Russia failed.

173
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,140
After this class...

174
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,620
We won't be able to experience it anymore...

175
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,060
This is important, too, okay?

176
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,650
Make sure you review it from your textbook later.

177
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,420
By the way, the reason Napoleon keeps his right hand in pocket is-

178
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,240
What? Why are you crying, Segawa-san?

179
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,200
You idiot! Don't cry!

180
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,030
No, this isn't tears. It's hot water from last night's bath.

181
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,210
Huh?

182
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:55,230
I get it. So you've all finally understood that history is made with tears on top of tears.

183
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,120
Meetings and farewells. And then yet another meeting.

184
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,470
The links between people are what make history.

185
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,720
Yes!

186
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,740
The character "people" is made
with two people supporting each other!

187
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,340
Yes! People can't live alone!

188
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:11,900
Can't...

189
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,010
Live alone...

190
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,760
If Onee-chan were to disappear...

191
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,370
No one in this world lives alone.

192
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,620
Even if they are far apart,
they're always connected by their hearts.

193
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,520
That's what I believe.

194
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,060
I want you all to understand that, too.

195
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,160
Please don't forget.

196
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,240
Tears are the sweat your heart perspires.

197
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,030
And love is the work your heart does.

198
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,740
That's the end of the lecture.

199
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,970
Thank you, everyone!

200
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,400
Don't go, Onee-chan!

201
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,160
Don't quit, Sensei!

202
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,340
There are so many more things we want to learn!

203
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,730
So many more things we want to do, too!

204
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:09,370
Sensei!

205
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:13,560
If you leave, my life-threatening experiences will decrease, and it won't be as enjoyable as it has been!

206
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,510
What are you all saying?

207
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:19,350
Do you still plan to leave us?

208
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,620
At least stay until we graduate!

209
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,440
Please promise us!

210
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,910
"Promise?"

211
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,750
Maybe this is...

212
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,180
Hey, everyone?

213
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,180
Sensei! Don't quit!

214
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,980
Thank you, everyone!

215
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,880
I'm so happy to know that you all cared about me so much!

216
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,940
Being a teacher was so much harder than I'd thought.

217
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,020
Sorry. And there's one more shop to visit, too.

218
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,000
Please get up.

219
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,480
So I gave my letter of resignation to Katsura-sensei.

220
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,310
Letter of resignation?

221
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,450
Would that be this?

222
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,700
Yes, that.

223
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,060
Sorry, I forgot to turn it in to the Superintendent.

224
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,920
Thank you very much!

225
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:18,480
Seeing your class, I was able to learn how amazing the bond between students and teachers can be.

226
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,030
Everyone! Forgive me for not noticing your love!

227
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:24,970
What is going on?

228
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,900
This is so touching.

229
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,920
Um...

230
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,910
What is it?

231
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:35,500
Um, we're having a storm of "Why?" in the class.

232
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,330
Were you quitting, Yukiji?

233
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,920
Why would I quit?

234
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:46,190
Then what was the unnatural dazzling smiley aura you were emitting from the morning about?

235
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,230
Ah, that'd be because it's been such a lucky day since the moment I woke up!

236
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,500
Shut up.

237
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,740
Saeki Nobuko-sensei's fortune telling for today!

238
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,960
Congratulations! You Scorpios have the best luck!

239
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,910
Especially those who are of blood type B,
love alcohol, and have a long pinky toe nail.

240
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,350
It's your luckiest day that comes only once every twelve years.

241
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,550
None of this is ever true.

242
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,060
Th-The tea stalk is standing!

243
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,720
Twin egg?!

244
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,690
They all have eyebrows!

245
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:21,960
It's the angel!

246
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,330
D-Double red sea bream!

247
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,250
That's how it went!

248
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,900
Don't you think it's amazing?

249
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,820
Makes me so happy, super happy, out of my mind, you know?

250
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,640
Wh-What did you say?

251
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,770
Look at these. These are the proof.

252
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,070
No wonder Napoleon believed in fortune telling.

253
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:49,050
I apologize for all the confusing reactions my stupid sister has caused!

254
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,240
Looks like we jumped the gun, too.

255
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,040
I knew something was strange from the start.

256
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,770
What were all the tears we shed for?

257
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,870
You will have to make up for this.

258
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,500
Yeah! Do fifty years worth of our homework!

259
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,500
What did I do?

260
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,380
I'll never believe in fortune telling!

261
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:14,410
That's how the unwed female teacher's heart rotted further.

262
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:21,320
Oh, then what's the meaning behind her giving Hinagiku-san the New Year allowance?

263
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,760
The mystery to that has been already solved.

264
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:29,950
Damn it, why don't you all just bring spears or guns for all I care, damn it.

265
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,490
She really needs so much attention.

266
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,530
One day, I will actually give you
a New Year's allowance, all right?

267
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,260
When is "one day?"

268
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,850
Next year.

269
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,080
Actually, I don't have much confidence that I can.

270
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,660
Three years...

271
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,160
Ten years?

272
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,500
I'll definitely give you one ten years from now.

273
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:15,340
Let's see, Pirates of the Beach and Man Spider 3.

274
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,070
Here we go.

275
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,710
Thank you as always.

276
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:21,590
Remind Nagi to pay attention to the return date.

277
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,200
I will.

278
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,080
Maria-san.

279
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,480
Please take these with you.

280
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,660
But...

281
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:32,490
Please don't worry. My grandmother sent a whole bunch.

282
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,460
Th-These are...

283
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,820
These are still being manufactured?

284
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,360
Actually, where is Saki-san's grandmother now?

285
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:42,830
Hey.

286
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,100
What should I do...

287
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:52,590
While I couldn't decide if I should send a New Year's card to Hayate-kun or not, the New Year's already come.

288
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:58,580
Besides, didn't I set this year's resolution to become a mature woman with confidence?!

289
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,220
No, I'll do it tomorrow.

290
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,640
Ow.

291
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,360
What's this?

292
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,660
You picking a fight with us?

293
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,570
What should I do? Am I going to be killed?

294
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,880
Are you listening to me? I'll beat you up or else!

295
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,460
You'll be dead meat if you look down on us!

296
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,330
Why do I always fall into pinches like this?

297
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,950
You've got nerve picking a fight with us.

298
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,680
Ah, that's right, you are Nishizawa-san, right?

299
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,360
Hayate-kun's friend, correct?

300
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,020
Thank you so much for letting Nagi sleep over last year.

301
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,520
It's nothing.

302
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:39,260
As you can tell, she's a difficult girl in some ways, but I hope you'll be good friends with her.

303
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,690
Y-Yes.

304
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,140
Oh, who might these people be?

305
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,080
Are they your friends, Nishizawa-san?

306
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,270
Why does it look like that to you?

307
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,730
What the hell are you?

308
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,050
A maid?

309
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:55,240
Just because you're a little cute maid, don't try to ignore us.

310
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:02,280
I'm sorry, I don't understand the Cre*in language.

311
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,240
We're speaking Japanese, asshole!

312
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,890
If you look down on us, even if you're a cute maid, we won't forgive you.

313
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,470
You are quite inelegant to try to grab a female's chest without cause.

314
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,720
Wh-What was that?

315
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,540
A simple self-defense move.

316
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,790
Although, I can only use it as a surprise attack.

317
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,910
You bitch.

318
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,470
You won't get off the hook now!

319
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,780
I suggest you stop.

320
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,670
You will not leave with just injuries otherwise.

321
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,180
Shut up!

322
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,080
See?

323
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,150
No! Help!

324
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,830
Are you all right?

325
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,790
Y-Yes. Thank you very much.

326
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,560
That's all right.

327
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,030
On another note, this.

328
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,930
You dropped it.

329
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,400
T-Th-This is nothing!

330
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,710
It's nothing.

331
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,730
I hope this will be a good year for you, Nishizawa-san.

332
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,020
Oh yeah. If you'd like, take this with you.

333
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,590
I'll see you again.

334
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,800
Nishizawa-san wishes to become like her.

335
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,150
Did anything new happen at school?

336
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,710
Nothing really.

337
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,040
How about you, Maria-san?

338
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,310
No, nothing in particular.

339
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,750
I wonder why. All of a sudden I feel like eating marshmallows.

340
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:54,690
Next week, we'll fight against sine, cosine, and tangent.

341
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,940
Katsura Yukiji's

342
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,610
Butler Network!

343
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,890
Hey there. It's your sexy teacher, Katsura Yukiji.

344
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,480
Listen, everyone; my character song is finally done!

345
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,850
I got nervous over my first recording,
but I did my best for the sake of my fans.

346
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,400
What are you doing, Onee-chan?

347
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,150
Oh, Hina, you were here?

348
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,800
Don't give me that.

349
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,740
We rehearsed last night regarding what to do here together, remember?

350
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:53,930
Did we?

351
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:58,080
Anyways, Hina's singing in my song, too, so make sure you buy it.

352
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,650
See you later!

353
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,650
Bye bye.

354
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,180
Does he have any weaknesses?

355
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,470
Weaknesses?

356
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:08,490
Manga or anime main characters usually come with weaknesses as a default setting.

357
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,960
Do they?

358
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,850
The debt-ridden butler's weaknesses, eh?

359
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:16,340
All right, leave it to me. Guys like that have surprising weaknesses.

360
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,700
Next time, Just like Dogs, Rats, and Bulldogs.

361
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,540
I have a good idea.

362
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,900
What's your plan?

363
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,890
That's...

364
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:27,310
Next time, come with equipment equipped.
