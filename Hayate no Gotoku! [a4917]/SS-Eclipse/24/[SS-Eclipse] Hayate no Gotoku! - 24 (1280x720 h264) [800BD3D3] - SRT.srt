1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,400
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,050
Got it?

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:13,560
Oh no!

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,900
What's the matter?

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,610
I forgot to return this DVD to Wataru.

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,610
Then I'll go return it.

7
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,300
How long have you been renting it?

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,180
Two years.

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,180
Or it could be three.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,820
There's not much point in rushing, but it should still be returned.

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,620
Why did a potted plant fall?

12
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,930
I think I'm out of luck today.

13
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,550
I really am out of luck.

14
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,310
But it's not like I'm experiencing any misfortune.

15
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,550
A butler is one who serves.

16
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,030
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

17
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:25,870
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

18
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,020
Yes.

19
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:36,170
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

20
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,710
Sir doesn't understand the minds of girls.

21
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,360
You jerk.

22
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,180
Heh.

23
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,180
I'm back.

24
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,590
I'm sorry, Hayate! That DVD was actually-

25
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:26,570
I'm sorry, Wataru-kun's store was closed, so I dropped it in the drop box.

26
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,190
Um, about that...

27
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,770
Welcome.

28
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:31,800
Hello.

29
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,930
Drats! I was making myself too comfortable and forgot to prep a gag.

30
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,730
What brings you here today?

31
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:41,530
What else! I heard Nagi isn't showing up to school at all,
so we came to check up on her!

32
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,470
Now that I think about it...

33
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,220
Forget about it.

34
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,240
The tea will go cold otherwise.

35
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,840
It's iced tea.

36
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,000
Since it is still hot out.

37
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,850
You're right.

38
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:57,120
If it's this hot in September,
I wonder how hot it'll be in October and November.

39
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,280
What the hell?!

40
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,550
But that was good. Keep it up.

41
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,730
That said, it is already autumn, isn't it?

42
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,990
Autumn equals food.

43
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,160
Yes, it is the season when you tend to forget stuff.

44
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,550
Season of fooey.

45
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,430
No good?

46
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,890
You lose the moment you ask!

47
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,160
You've got to have conviction in your words!

48
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,330
Y-Yes.

49
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,610
Come to think of...

50
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,630
Is that a lead-in into a new topic?

51
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,350
Lead-in?

52
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,250
Or are you trying to act dumb, as well?

53
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,720
No, my stole...

54
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,090
Stole?

55
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:39,260
Yes, it's a new stole of mine,
but I seem to have misplaced it somewhere.

56
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,360
You left it somewhere?

57
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,820
Oh, then I'll go look for it.

58
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,070
It is all right; I do not mind losing it.

59
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,890
It was only ¥50,000,000.

60
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,570
I'll go look for it right away!

61
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,270
Hayate-sama is such a kind person.

62
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,450
Of course! My Hayate is the kindest
and most reliable man in the world.

63
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,680
If I'm right, Isumi-san was taking a rest in the guest room.

64
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,380
Today was a mess.

65
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,560
The best thing to do on a day like this is sleep.

66
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:17,460
And look, here's a stole that's perfect for a blanket.

67
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,110
Let me grab it with these claws that tear fabrics apart.

68
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,490
Stop it, Tama! That stole costs ¥50,000,000!

69
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,040
Keep your hands off of Isumi's stole!

70
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,610
You've got guts to try to touch Isumi's stuff when you're a pet!

71
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,050
Seriously!

72
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,780
Wataru-kun? When did he come?

73
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,430
Even I don't get many chances to touch Isumi's belongings.

74
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,520
Her belongings...

75
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,330
Wataru-kun?

76
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,260
What are you doing?

77
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,460
D-Debt-ridden butler!

78
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,890
Since when have you been here?

79
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,440
I've been here all along.

80
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,150
Did you see me just...

81
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,620
Then?

82
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,080
Well, when I...

83
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:09,150
You mean an adolescent's illness-like act of taking a whiff of the attire of a girl he likes.

84
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,340
It's a normal thing for thirteen year olds to do.

85
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,520
Are you going to tell on me?

86
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,620
Are you going to tell what you just saw to Nagi and Isumi?!

87
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,730
Don't worry.

88
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,650
Butlers of the Sanzenins won't do anything to embarrass our guests.

89
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:36,570
But the Sanzenins' pet will do things to embarrass guests.

90
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,370
Damn you, tiger!

91
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,330
Tama!

92
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:43,130
I thought you weren't going to speak in front of others since it destroys other people's dreams?

93
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,550
What I don't want to destroy are the dreams of girls.

94
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,790
I'd rather destroy the dreams of boys!

95
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,220
This anime is targeted towards boys, mind you.

96
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:59,270
Therefore I'll report his actions to everyone with a dying message equal to that of Co**an's.

97
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,480
Wait, if Isumi finds out!

98
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,310
I never knew Wataru-kun was like that.

99
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,640
How filthy.

100
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,640
He's lower than bugs.

101
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,960
Please don't worry and leave the rest to me.

102
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,840
Th-Thanks, and sorry, debt-ridden butler.
I leave the rest to you.

103
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,510
Yes.

104
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,890
By the way, why are you here, Wataru-kun?

105
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:28,390
Oh, that's because that idiot returned the DVD I gave her.

106
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,260
So I came to give it back to her.

107
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,120
Oh, that's good.

108
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,670
Off I go now!

109
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,540
All right, first, I'll spread the rumor over the internet and make it so that the Lady will notice it.

110
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,460
I've started so many other rumors before.

111
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,560
It's fine! I can do this!

112
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,320
I'll use I.T. to keep my ranking high!

113
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,020
Tama. That's enough out of you making our guests uncomfortable.

114
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,160
Otherwise, even if you are Milady's pet, I won't forgive you.

115
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,030
Y-

116
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,500
Yes, Sir!!!

117
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,930
Tama's reflecting upon his actions.

118
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:15,050
But still, I don't know how I can face Isumi, so you give it to her.

119
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,560
Okay.

120
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,100
And ah...

121
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,770
Thank you for saving me.

122
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,590
It's my pleasure to be of aid.

123
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,190
Excuse me now.

124
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,170
Ayasaki Hayate.

125
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,820
I hope I can become a man like him.

126
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,260
Wataru-chan stares at Hayate's back.

127
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,730
Here's your stole, Isumi-san.

128
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,370
Glad you got it back, eh, Isumi?

129
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,770
Yes, thank you, Hayate-sama.

130
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,690
Oh, where's Sakuya-san?

131
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,870
She went home.

132
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,860
Saying that there isn't anyone to nail a jab on.

133
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,790
Then I'll make my way home, as well.

134
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,020
Please be careful on your way home.

135
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:08,160
Hayate-sama, you look happy.

136
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,060
Yes. A certain person said "thank you" to me.

137
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,460
My!

138
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,460
Things haven't been going too well recently.

139
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,330
I got run over by a truck this morning.

140
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,520
People glared at me, too.

141
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,340
So I was a little depressed.

142
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,870
But looks like I was just thinking too much.

143
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,950
It's nothing new for me to experience misery,

144
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,450
so it must have been just coincidence.

145
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,680
Hayate-sama.

146
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,380
Yes?

147
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,450
I-Isumi-san?

148
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,340
Um...

149
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,250
That was for finding my stole.

150
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,570
I think things will be a little better now.

151
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,300
Have a good evening.

152
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,870
And I really like you, Hayate-sama.

153
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,600
A love-comedy situation!

154
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,830
Continuing to Part B.

155
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,830
Riaru Rabu = Real Love.

156
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,830
Riaru Rabu.

157
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,970
Brajya Conpurekkusu

158
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,970
Brajya Conpurekkusu = Brassiere Complex

159
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,320
I-Isumi-san.

160
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,150
I really like you, Hayate-sama.

161
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,150
A dream...

162
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,160
I see! I must be easily liked by children!

163
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,960
Our main character has a pure mind that leaves children out of his target zone.

164
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,500
Have you been up all night?

165
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:16,620
Yeah.

166
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:27,620
Yesterday, it looked like they were hugging to me.

167
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,670
What was that?

168
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:33,560
If it bothers you that much, how about asking them?

169
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:39,640
But, if I did and it turns out Isumi really does love him...

170
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:46,280
Since Hayate loves me, I'll end up hurting Isumi.

171
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,890
Ah... I see.

172
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,690
But it could have been some kind of mistake.

173
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,950
There is a high possibility of Isumi holding affection for Hayate.

174
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,130
After all, Hayate's the most handsome man in the universe.

175
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,750
Wow...

176
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:06,550
Then it'll be trouble if that most handsome man in the universe is sweet-talking Isumi-san.

177
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,640
That can't possibly be happening!

178
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,830
Hayate would never do that to anyone other than me!

179
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,850
Not to Isumi! He'd never fall in love with any other girls!

180
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,480
He'd never...

181
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,260
I'm going to see Hayate!

182
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,250
Okay.

183
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,940
Hayate!

184
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,120
Y-Y-Y-Yes, what is it, Milady?

185
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,290
I have something I want to ask you.

186
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,270
Yes.

187
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,490
Do you, um, care for Isumi?

188
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,790
Yes.

189
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,540
I do care for Isumi-san.

190
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,470
Are you serious?

191
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:47,950
Yes.

192
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,520
Do you seriously love Isumi?

193
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,990
Answer me! I saw you take action yesterday!

194
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,220
Um, I probably wouldn't say that I love her.

195
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,450
Then are you treating her as a game?

196
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,230
Was yesterday just part of your fun?

197
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,130
Rather than Isumi-san,
it's usually Sakuya-san that I have fun with.

198
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,610
Oh, but it's true that I'd like to have more fun with Isumi-san.

199
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,960
M-Milady?

200
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,180
You... You...

201
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,980
You jerk!

202
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,670
That hurt.

203
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,630
I shouldn't try to crack eggs with my head.

204
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,450
I've lost faith in you, Hayate!

205
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,320
Are you all right?

206
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,790
Um, did I do something?

207
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,250
Ah, I-I'm not sure.

208
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:40,300
Could Isumi-san saying she likes me be the problem?

209
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,380
Isumi-san did?

210
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,070
Yes, she's cute, isn't she?

211
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:51,170
I tend to be liked by young children,
so I might do well as a teacher at a nursery school.

212
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:51,970
Eh?

213
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,110
I guess...

214
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:55,880
This is...

215
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,250
I have to do something.

216
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,590
Really...

217
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,940
Why are men interested in watching something like this?

218
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,520
But then again, you've watched about thirty of them yourself.

219
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:17,380
Sir is still a child, so he probably isn't interested in girls yet,

220
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,980
but I wonder if he'd want to watch one of these, too.

221
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,230
No, this must be limited to a small fraction of men.

222
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,540
I'm sure Sir will not!

223
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,920
But he hasn't left the house since last night.

224
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,480
What could he be doing?

225
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,360
I-I-I'm sorry, the store's not open yet.

226
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,330
Lady Nagi!

227
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,830
Sorry to interrupt.

228
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,030
No, it can't be...

229
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,410
Isumi can't possibly love the debt-ridden butler...

230
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,910
What are you sleeping around for?!

231
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,430
N-Nagi! What are you doing here?

232
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,990
I ran away from home!

233
00:14:58,990 --> 00:14:59,850
Huh?

234
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,290
The girl ran from her home due to
a broken heart and the feeling of being abandoned.

235
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,810
Oh, you guys can return now.

236
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,590
But don't let Maria know, all right?

237
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,120
Yes!

238
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,680
Wh-What do we do?

239
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,750
We have to find her, obviously.

240
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,660
Okay!

241
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,560
H-Hayate-kun!

242
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,330
I'll check Isumi-san's house first!

243
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,470
Wait!

244
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,660
E-Excuse me! What do you mean Lady Nagi ran away from home?

245
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,610
She'll be in your care here for a while.

246
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,550
By the way, Kijima Saki-dono.

247
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,560
Yes?

248
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,310
The one and only granddaughter of
the Sanzenins will be living here for a while.

249
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,650
If anything should happen...

250
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,220
You know the consequences, right?

251
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,130
You won't be able to get off the hook!

252
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,410
Anyway, we're not going to get anywhere even if we fight like this.

253
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,510
You're right.

254
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,140
Let's go to Isumi's house...

255
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,070
...And hear her feelings.

256
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,130
My, Nagi ran away from home?

257
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,180
Yes. Do you have any ideas?

258
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,480
Let's see, she's probably at-

259
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,250
What's wrong?

260
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,440
Dust got in my eye.

261
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,660
Are you all right?

262
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,520
Hey, couldn't it have been a mistake?

263
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,660
Right, them hugging each other could have been from-

264
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,400
It's not coming out.

265
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,650
Hayate!

266
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,670
Milady!

267
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,780
You're here!

268
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,520
You came to meet Isumi the moment I disappeared?!

269
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,790
Huh? Yes, I did.

270
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:04,850
I sell you to Isumi for ¥50,000,000!

271
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,970
Milady!

272
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,190
Milady! Why?!

273
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,680
I will, then.

274
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,660
Shall I buy Hayate-sama from you?

275
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,590
For ¥50,000,000?

276
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:28,830
Milady!

277
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,660
Lady Nagi!

278
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:36,530
And thus the love-comedy turns out to become a full-scale yucky, icky conflict.

279
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,500
Meanwhile, Maria was-

280
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,900
I have to do something but...

281
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,840
Wait, I'm all alone here?

282
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:55,360
What do you plan on doing, borrowing a boring DVD like this?

283
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,120
Huh?

284
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,530
You're borrowing a bunch of trash movies
that were only popular due to people's voices.

285
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,700
That's none of your business.

286
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,030
Shut up! Keep your mouth shut!

287
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,960
Listen to me!

288
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,500
Time is finite!

289
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,790
There are countless masterpieces
that must be watched in this world.

290
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,800
You are lacking Gund*m knowledge!!!

291
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,790
G-Gund*m?

292
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,410
Yes, Gund*m.

293
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:21,310
Therefore, I'll lend you from season 1 all the way to Double *.

294
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,420
All the way?

295
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,370
Listen! Don't sleep!

296
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,090
You must not sleep and watch it like you life's about to end!

297
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,290
Especially Counterattack and Turn A are-

298
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,190
You idiot!

299
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,190
Don't rent my DVDs out randomly!

300
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,340
I'm not renting them out randomly!

301
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,160
I'm picking out masterpieces!

302
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,610
Besides, why are you here?!

303
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,090
Because I ran away from home. What else?

304
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:47,100
And the reason why you didn't want to be at home was because the debt-ridden butler was there, wasn't it?

305
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,880
Then go home already!

306
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,920
He's no longer at your place!

307
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,840
Not at my place...

308
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,580
Hayate isn't...

309
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,030
...at my place...

310
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,100
SIR!!!!!!!!!

311
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,790
What are you doing picking on her?!

312
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,190
I wasn't really picking on her...

313
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,030
If you're like that, even Isumi-san will hate you!

314
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,870
SFX: DONG

315
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,070
Eh?

316
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,190
I'll burn down this shop!

317
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,030
Burn away!

318
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:25,000
And Saki-san was being toyed with by two children.

319
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,950
You can't, Sir!

320
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,010
Next week, we'll fight against robots.

321
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,340
I am a cat.

322
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,140
I do not have a name yet.

323
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,200
The sky's up high as always.

324
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,330
Look at that! It's so cute!

325
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,350
Wow, it's a kitty.

326
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,370
It's so soothing!

327
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:01,810
Yeah, whatever. If you're going to pity me, then feed me.

328
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:04,220
Wait, you're seriously going? You heartless people!

329
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,150
You hypocrites!

330
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,010
Damn, the rain in the city's so cold.

331
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,530
Man, I'm hungry.

332
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,030
It's milk!

333
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,740
Damn you!

334
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,810
Weren't you going to give that to me?

335
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,150
What? Mouth-to-mouth?

336
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,080
Bro...

337
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,520
Hey, are you okay?

338
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,870
Did you catch cold?

339
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,910
Oh, Wataru-kun. So this is where you were.

340
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,680
Ah, you found the kitty.

341
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,180
I'm happy for you.

342
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:04,120
You were worried about him and searched for him every time it rained.

343
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:10,580
You were looking for me, Bro?

344
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,180
Good kitty, good kitty.

345
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,180
What's your name, Bro?

346
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,660
'taru.

347
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,800
'taru.

348
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:27,000
Oh, so this kitty's called Tatu Taru?

349
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,420
Heh?

350
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,440
Yup!

351
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,290
That's such a cute name.

352
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,300
I-It's a little lame, but I'll live with it.

353
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,210
Nagi and...

354
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,050
Hayate's...

355
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,780
Butler Network!

356
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,590
Thanks for tuning in. This is Sanzenin Nagi.

357
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,920
This is Ayasaki Hayate.

358
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,900
It's Sakuya.

359
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,060
Hey, I think this show limits my screentime too much.

360
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,340
There are people who show up
every week without real purpose.

361
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:48,140
That's because anytime you show up,
other characters fade away.

362
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,670
I won't be fooled by that, debt-ridden butler.

363
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,540
It's because Saku's a character who gets forgotten.

364
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,920
What'd'ou say?!

365
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,020
Oh, forget it.

366
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,710
Here's my borderline sexy shot.

367
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,520
How was it? Did you burn it in to your eyes?

368
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,680
Bye bye!

369
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:04,410
It's natural for me to be discarded by Milady.

370
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:09,290
It was like a dream to be able to work at a mansion like that to begin with.

371
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:12,540
Hayate probably hates me now.

372
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,870
In that case, why not test the love?

373
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,100
Test the love?

374
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,940
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

375
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,070
Shake the Heart

376
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,340
Fake a kidnapping?!

377
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,930
You can't do that!

378
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,310
The galaxy is calling for me.
