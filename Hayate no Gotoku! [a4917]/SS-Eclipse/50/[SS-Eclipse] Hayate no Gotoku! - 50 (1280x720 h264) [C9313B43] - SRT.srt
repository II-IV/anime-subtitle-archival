1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,990
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,460
Milady, good morning.

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,390
Come now.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,810
Wake up.

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,730
Hey, it's still 32:00.

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,560
Note: In Japan, the clock for TV late-night programming runs past 24:00 into the next day

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,560
Let me sleep a little more.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,830
Please don't say that.

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,270
Today's a great day outside.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,460
How about going out once in a while?

11
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,450
I'll pack a bento for you.

12
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,400
Riceball-san. Riceball-san.

13
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:46,930
Newspaper Headlines: High School Girls Ultra Quiz!!
Must compete as a pair of best friends.

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,020
Look.

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,930
There are many spring-like events.

16
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,370
How does this look?

17
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,510
The High School Girl Ultra Quiz.

18
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,380
You must compete as a pair with your best friend.

19
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,030
Not interested.

20
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,590
I'd rather see the faces of those
who choose to compete in these.

21
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,520
What a waste. It says it accepts walk-in challengers.

22
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,690
The prize is-

23
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,710
Milady?

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,780
This is the prize when I win this competition?

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,210
This... This will...

26
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,480
This will become mine?!

27
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,170
All right, let's compete!

28
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:13,920
Why?

29
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,910
That's the story. So do you want to pair up with me?

30
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,100
So? Okay? Good? Yay?

31
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,690
What? You're in Osaka now?

32
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:21,830
What? Go alone?

33
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:22,990
Damn, she hung up.

34
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,360
Looks like Sakuya-san wasn't available.

35
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,410
Then I'll try Isumi next.

36
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:27,930
No, she's a bad choice.

37
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,200
Who can I pair up with?

38
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,620
Why don't you go, Hayate-kun?

39
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,530
If we need a high school girl appearance, I have several patterns ready.

40
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,980
Oh yeah. That's a trick we can use!

41
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,780
I... I'll go look for someone who's willing to be your partner.

42
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,980
Damn, he got away.

43
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,450
Hmm, a quiz tournament, eh.

44
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,710
Would competing in this create
an extra page in the diary of youth?

45
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,420
What I'm most interested in is that...

46
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,500
...they have an all-you-can-eat coupon at
blah blah shabu shabu restaurant!

47
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,760
This sounds good.

48
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,160
Image, on.

49
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:08,010
Oh my god. Oh my god!

50
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,270
What a big dream I just had.

51
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,700
But... if I do win... maybe I can ask him.

52
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,120
Can I ask him?

53
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,810
B-But...

54
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,490
Who... Who...

55
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,030
Who can I go compete with?!

56
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,460
Owwie.

57
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,950
Hayate-kun?!

58
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,200
Nishizawa-san. I-I'm sorry.

59
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,240
I was caught up in my thoughts.

60
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,270
This is...

61
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,770
Oh, this is it! What good, good timing.

62
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,490
Nishizawa-san.

63
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,620
Y-Yes.

64
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,890
Could you be a partner for this quiz tournament?

65
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,280
I-I will.

66
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,460
That's great! Lady Nagi will be happy.

67
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,800
This week, I will lead the story as the host.

68
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:09,530
Tima~

69
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,840
Shine! Jump! Shake your booty.

70
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,840
The 4256th High School Girl Ultra Quiz!

71
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,970
It has finally started with hundreds of thousands of
audience members who're a pain in the neck to draw.

72
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,060
Your host and MC will be me, Mikiri Teruo, and...

73
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,440
Abe Maou ~tima.

74
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,350
By the way,

75
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,190
anyone out there remember me ~tima?

76
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,190
Hey, don't try to stand out, boob monster.

77
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,380
I'm sorry ~tima.

78
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,490
Let's have the competitors come in.

79
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,710
We have a total of ten thousand pairs from around the nation.

80
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,820
Who will be the one to answer
all the quizzes and claim victory?!

81
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,870
Can't wait to find out ~tima.

82
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,960
Aika-san, why are we here?

83
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,710
Because I thought you like shabu shabu, Chiharu-san.

84
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,760
Why do I have to pair up with the Hamster?

85
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,420
That's what I want to ask you.

86
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,930
I'm practically taking a handicap like this.

87
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,160
Resist. Resist, me.

88
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,260
Anyway, I can win this myself,
so I don't care if my partner is Ham or Sausage.

89
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:57,760
I must resist this. What will I do if my future boss at wherever I work turns out to be a big sexual harasser?

90
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,840
Plus, this is the very first request made of me by Hayate-kun.

91
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,430
Let's win this and take the trophy.

92
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,690
When I win this, I'm going to go eat shabu shabu with Hayate-kun.

93
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,400
What are you talking about? I'll never allow that!

94
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,080
What?

95
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,350
If you want to eat, go alone with your lonely heart.

96
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,970
Never. Even if you say I can't, it's too late now.

97
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,310
I can't back out anymore.

98
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,250
Both Hayate and the trophy belong to me!

99
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,400
Hayate-kun will go have shabu shabu with me!

100
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:31,110
I swore to myself that this year, I will chase Hayate-kun even to the ends of the Earth.

101
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,310
Looks like both of them are ready for the fight.

102
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,990
Let's get the first stage going!

103
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,580
First trial is the famous, Yes or No Quiz ~tima!

104
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:47,010
Please move to the side you think is the answer to the question ~tima.

105
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,250
Picking the answer from two choices is easy.

106
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,760
We can't go anywhere unless we get it right.

107
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,310
Problem one!

108
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,860
You find Ishikawa Station in the Ishikawa Prefecture.

109
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:00,750
They're trying to pull off a trick question,
yet they're actually testing the honesty of the competitors.

110
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,820
The answer is obviously "Yes"!

111
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,320
This way! It's "No"!

112
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,500
I think it's "Yes"!

113
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,080
Do as I say!

114
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,080
Argumentative pair, please choose an answer already ~tima.

115
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,380
Don't be a drag from the beginning!

116
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,360
Time up!

117
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,810
The answer is...

118
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:21,910
"No".

119
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,620
You find this station in Aomori Prefecture.

120
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,040
To the incorrect pairs, "Good-bye Baby!"

121
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,760
See? What'd I tell you?

122
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,920
This is a common sense problem if you play ******** *S.

123
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,860
If you know the answer, say so sooner!

124
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,780
Problem two.

125
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,490
Chimpanzees and giant pandas.

126
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,120
Newborn giant pandas weigh less than newborn chimpanzees.

127
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,810
They're called "giant", so I'm sure a panda has to weigh more.

128
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,680
The answer must be "No".

129
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,390
The answer is "Yes"! I'm sure of it!

130
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,160
It's "No"! Stay out of my way!

131
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,940
It's "Yes"! Just come with me!

132
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,580
It's that pair again.

133
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,920
I'm telling you, it's "Yes"!

134
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,100
Okay, the answer is...

135
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,210
"Yes"!

136
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,090
Bye-bye to pairs who chose "No".

137
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,700
See? Baby giant pandas are 15cm tall and weigh only 90 - 130g.

138
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,790
I saw it on Animal ***net.

139
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,320
Tell me that first!

140
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,590
Problem three is about Japanese sake.

141
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,840
The temperature of "warm" sake is 40°C.

142
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,100
This problem isn't targeting the right audience ~tima.

143
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,090
What's the problem? You can
go back to your agency if you want.

144
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,910
Please don't, I beg you ~tima.

145
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,130
No one's moving.

146
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:30,410
Legally, sake is something high school girls
don't have anything to do with.

147
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,460
Ah, right. I forgot to tell you.

148
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,990
In this quiz, all pairs have life-lines that they can use.

149
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,270
It's totally a copy of Who Wants to be a Mil****aire.

150
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,610
There. Take it. It's yours.

151
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,920
It feels like a rule made just for this problem.

152
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,470
However, you can only use one of the choices ~tima.

153
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,640
Think well.

154
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,180
Telephone!

155
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,360
The Sanzenin-Nishizawa pair is using the telephone.

156
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,480
They're such wimps.

157
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,520
What? What should I do?

158
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,880
You're putting me on the hot seat already?

159
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,880
But, I do know the answer.

160
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,350
The answer is-

161
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,490
Yes.

162
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,730
The answer is "No".

163
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,870
The temperature of "warm" sake is approximately 45°C.

164
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,940
Great, Maria! I knew I could count on you.

165
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:19,800
And for your reference, there are: boiling, hot, warm, lukewarm, body temperature, and sunshine.

166
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,800
What about me...

167
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,930
The answer is "No".

168
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,440
There were no incorrect pairs.

169
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,280
Drop the bomb.

170
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,510
You saved us, Maria.

171
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,660
Thank you.

172
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,230
Keep it up.

173
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,980
Let's now move to the second stage.

174
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,100
The next one is also famous, the Scatter Away Quiz.

175
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,030
Pick up a quiz that gets scattered from the sky.

176
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,090
The time limit is five minutes.

177
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,200
You'll move on to the next stage if you can answer even one question ~tima.

178
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,500
Let's go!

179
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,860
All right, I'll go!

180
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,780
It's fine, I'll go.

181
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,970
Hush. You play with this.

182
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,300
Ahh, this popping. You can't stop once you start.

183
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,340
Hey, she's gone already!

184
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,120
I'm telling you to stay out of my way.

185
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,310
What's wrong?

186
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,440
Muscle cramp...

187
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,950
Geez, you...

188
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,990
I'm actually not good at running.

189
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,940
Too bad, you picked a losing card ~tima.

190
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,940
Actually, most of the envelopes contain false cards, so good luck ~tima.

191
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,260
Oh boy.

192
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,250
Get moving. You don't have any stamina, do you?

193
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,600
Are you in a position to say that?

194
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,890
Get a move on!

195
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:24,240
'Kay, 'kay, 'kay.

196
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,470
You lose. You lose. You lose.

197
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,280
We might not have any more chances.

198
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,770
I will not give up.

199
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,540
Eh?

200
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,340
I will keep moving for Hayate and the trophy's sake!

201
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,380
Even if my leg's cramping!

202
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,730
You're right. Shabu shabu with
Hayate-kun waits beyond this ordeal.

203
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,600
You're still wishing for such a nonchalant event?

204
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,020
I'm sure Hayate-kun likes shabu shabu, too!

205
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,540
The trophy!

206
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,640
The shabu shabu!

207
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,980
One minute left ~tima.

208
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,020
Oh no!

209
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,110
Open it please.

210
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:52,770
Okay.

211
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:53,690
You lose.

212
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,110
Just kidding. Here's your question.

213
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,330
Don't confuse us!

214
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:00,260
How much does it cost to ride
the Yamanote line for one station?

215
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,940
Um... Two thousand-

216
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,380
As of 2008, it's ¥130.

217
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,680
You got it right ~tima.

218
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,970
Easy peasy.

219
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,050
Have you witnessed the power that normality represents?

220
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,460
Moving on to the third stage.

221
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,860
Break Out of a Sealed Room Quiz ~tima!

222
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,460
If you can get out of that room within three minutes, you are eligible to answer the question.

223
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,800
I guess I'll leave this to a commoner.

224
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,460
What? It won't open!

225
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,320
The window won't either!

226
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,350
Nor the floor...

227
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,170
None of them look like they'll open.

228
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,240
If it means getting out, it doesn't matter how.

229
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,670
That's the way commoners do it.

230
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,000
Don't mind if I go out first.

231
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,820
A skyscraper?!

232
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,020
Twenty seconds left.

233
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,620
Where is it? I don't see anything.

234
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,680
God. You're so useless.

235
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,000
In games where you get out of a sealed room, you usually...

236
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,200
First you do this,

237
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,870
and find this here,

238
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,620
then when you do this,

239
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,400
you can open this to find this,

240
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,980
which you put in the slot, and...

241
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,680
No way.

242
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,380
It opened!

243
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,260
You made it out ~tima!

244
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,690
Congratulations. Here's your problem.

245
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,950
No way!

246
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:25,690
The very first game console sold in the world, back in 1972, was...

247
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,970
Um...

248
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,130
**telli-

249
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,210
Od**sey.

250
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,560
You got it right ~tima!

251
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,710
Next is finally the final stage!

252
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,370
I guess you paid the debt back you owed me in the second stage.

253
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,710
After all, all we need is my brain.

254
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:50,550
When the final stage ends,
will the Goddess of Victory bless these two?

255
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:55,140
Mikiri-san, I just noticed that your voice sounds identical to the narration voice we usually hear in this show ~tima.

256
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,170
Your "tima" is annoying!

257
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,110
Tima ~tima.

258
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:03,560
Also, there may or may not be some changes in this love triangle over the butler.

259
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,150
Continues in the second half.

260
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:05,830
Tima~

261
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,870
Keidoumyaku

262
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,870
Keidoumyaku = Carotid artery

263
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,910
Kuttemo sugu neruna!

264
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,910
Kuttemo sugu neruna = Don't eat right after you go to bed!

265
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,630
Everyone, do you want to go to New York?

266
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,940
Yes, I do!

267
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,240
Then pay for yourself.

268
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,210
I don't have the money!

269
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:26,420
Let's have our finalists come out ~tima.

270
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,380
Here's the first pair.

271
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,800
"We're so close we get in baths together."

272
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,690
Sanzenin-Nishizawa pair ~tima!

273
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,860
Don't introduce us like that!

274
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,150
Who leaked the information?!

275
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,100
The second pair is,

276
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,530
"We were supposed to have more screentime after the third season."

277
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:47,500
Kasumi Aika and Harukaze Chiharu pair!

278
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,390
What? The student council vice president and secretary?

279
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,340
Aika-san. We made it to the finals somehow.

280
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,110
Yes, we did, Chiharu-san.

281
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,850
Here's the third and final pair.

282
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,730
"We always eat the strawberry first when we have shortcakes and menma first when we have ramen."

283
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,360
You do?

284
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,290
I guess.

285
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,410
The expected winner of the tournament.

286
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,790
Katsura Hinagiku-Hanabishi Miki pair.

287
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,360
What? Even Hinagiku was in it?

288
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:15,480
Hey, I followed you because you wanted me to help you pick a gift for your relative who's being admitted to his top choice school.

289
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,780
Why did I end up here?

290
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,470
Basically, I want to make the prize money the gift.

291
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,540
With Hina-chan there, they have to be the winners.

292
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,380
I think I can get some good footage.

293
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,300
Go! Go! Milady!

294
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,600
You can do it! You can do it!

295
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,940
Hey, sit down! We can't see!

296
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,590
I'm sorry. I'll control myself.

297
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,980
Let's forget about the cheer groups
that stand out more than the actual competitors.

298
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,600
The final stage.

299
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,110
Don't Slip! Press the Button Quiz ~tima.

300
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,440
When you get an answer right,
the other groups' slides will rise a bit at a time ~tima.

301
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,230
The pair that remains up there to the end wins ~tima!

302
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,860
With Hina next to me, there's nothing to worry about.

303
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:59,480
Oh. So this height is already cracking her limit.

304
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,780
I-I'm fine.

305
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,950
I-I'm fine as long as we're at this height.

306
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,170
We'll answer all the questions.

307
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,020
I won't allow you to make any mistakes.

308
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,720
Okay? Okay?

309
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,070
This is the battle I can't lose.

310
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,260
I made it this far. I can't afford to lose.

311
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,690
Problem one!

312
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,620
I think, therefore I exist.

313
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,600
Say it in Latin.

314
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,260
Cogito ergo sum.

315
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,250
Correct ~tima.

316
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,260
Here's the next problem.

317
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,250
Those who understands coffee's true-

318
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,170
Barista.

319
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,480
Correct!

320
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,550
The quantum mechanical paradoxical thought experiment-

321
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,680
Schrödinger's cat!

322
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,980
Treaty of Meerssen!

323
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,830
Diary of Sarashino!

324
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,650
Nimouson!

325
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:41,090
Permin!

326
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:41,690
Ucchari!

327
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,290
Amazing! Katsura-Hanabishi pair is making this a landslide.

328
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,820
Keep it up.

329
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,750
You should answer some, too.

330
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:54,830
Aika-san...

331
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,250
To tell the truth, I'm coming to my limit.

332
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,570
Y-You, too, Chiharu-san?

333
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:03,840
You're right. Then let's take our leave, shall we?

334
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,250
What? She's gone already.

335
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,960
I'll follow you!

336
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,300
Kasumi-Harukaze pair, disqualified.

337
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,020
Meanwhile, Sanzenin-Nishizawa pair
seems to be in a tight spot, too ~tima.

338
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,750
Must answer...

339
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,320
...the next one...

340
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,670
Problem!

341
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,200
What fathers don't like is...

342
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,620
It's mine!

343
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,820
Papaya!

344
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,160
Pun Note: Papaya = Papaiya = Papa iya = Papa hates.

345
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,160
...papaya, but instead...

346
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,470
...name four other tropical fruits.

347
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,260
Kiwi, mango, pineapple, durian.

348
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,400
She gets it right again ~tima!

349
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,490
It's like sitting on a banana peel!

350
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,010
What will Sanzenin-Nishizawa pair do?

351
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,340
The angle is starting to get really nice ~tima.

352
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,280
You're disqualified when either one of you falls ~tima.

353
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,680
Don't copy me.

354
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,110
I think I'm at my limit. I think... I think...

355
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,310
This is nothing.

356
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,210
For Hayate's sake!

357
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,800
I will win and get the trophy!

358
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,200
Why is Nagi-chan all "trophy, trophy"?

359
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,000
Oh yeah, the trophy I saw on the flier...

360
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,490
It looked like Hayate-kun.

361
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,240
Nagi-chan...

362
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,810
I can't anymore!

363
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,650
Hayate...

364
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,440
You've got to fight for it.

365
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,160
You want to win the trophy, right?

366
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,670
Let's keep trying just a little more.

367
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,130
Ham...

368
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,320
I bet when we combine forces, there's nothing to fear.

369
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,130
Yeah! Let's do this!

370
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,080
Here's the problem.

371
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,940
What dango becomes quiet the moment you look at it?

372
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,980
That's it!

373
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,770
Go ahead, Sanzenin-Nishizawa pair.

374
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:58,100
Pun Note: Mitara = If you look at it; Shi~ = Onomatopoeia for asking for silence.

375
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,400
Mitara... shi~

376
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,880
Mitarashi dango.

377
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,290
Correct!

378
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,360
You did it!

379
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,820
How many letters were in the longest episode title ever for an anime made in Japan?

380
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,230
Leave this to me!

381
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:12,690
Episode 26 of School Ru**le with 187 letters!

382
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,390
Correct ~tima!

383
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,210
Well done, Nagi-chan!

384
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,840
Statue!

385
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,740
Matanpo!

386
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,620
Sam!

387
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,610
Iropaka!

388
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,050
No way! I'm getting pushed up?!

389
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:26,160
Rather, how is she pressing the button in that state?

390
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,680
That is a curious question... but we're...

391
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,560
You can do it!

392
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,920
Keep it up!

393
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,600
Will this one be the last problem?

394
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,880
At the cake house known for Koyuki's Special Seafood Cake,

395
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,400
how much do the cream puffs cost?

396
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,410
We know!

397
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,040
It's impossible for them to press it, but let's hear the answer.

398
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,010
Um...

399
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,310
It was...

400
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,080
¥200 a puff!

401
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,860
Correct ~tima!!!

402
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,170
Looks like this is the end.

403
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,460
Adieu!

404
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,500
That was a great fall.

405
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,440
The Katsura-Hanabishi pair takes an unexpected fall ~tima!

406
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:30,710
Therefore, the winner is the Sanzenin-Nishizawa pair.

407
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,750
I'm surprised you remembered the price.

408
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,190
Same to you.

409
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,220
For a hamster, you did pretty well.

410
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,610
For a pampered lady, you had some guts.

411
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,130
Oh yeah, the trophy!

412
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,340
Give it to me!

413
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,310
What should I do with this...

414
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,780
Maybe I'll go with my family, after all.

415
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,570
Nishizawa-san!

416
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,020
Ha... Hayate-kun.

417
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,400
Congratulations on your victory.

418
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,560
It was an amazing battle.

419
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,210
It embarrasses me a little to hear that.

420
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,640
Th-Thank you.

421
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,690
No, I should be the one thanking you.

422
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,370
Thank you very much.

423
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:25,130
I hope we stay on good terms like this, Nishizawa-san.

424
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,620
Yes, of course.

425
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:45,990
Hayate-kun. The day you accept my feelings might still be a long way away.

426
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:53,570
But, even so, I can continue to keep thinking about you, right?

427
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,160
Right?

428
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,500
What are you doing, Hayate?

429
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,210
We're going home!

430
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,660
We'll have a party tonight!

431
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,010
Yes, Milady.

432
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,730
Ah, wait!

433
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,910
Yes?

434
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,970
If you need something, say it already, Hamster.

435
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,950
Um, if you two want to...

436
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,790
Can we go eat shabu shabu together?

437
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,720
Can we?

438
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,280
Milady.

439
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,560
Sure.

440
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,070
Honestly, what thin meat!

441
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,310
Obviously, since it's shabu shabu.

442
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:37,510
What? You dare say that when I came with you?

443
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,510
You have a problem?

444
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,250
Calm down. I'll scoop all the lye out, okay?

445
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:47,320
By the way, shabu shabu is very healthy, and it's recommended for middle-aged people living alone, too.

446
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,610
Next week, we'll fight against the ¥150,000,000 we've all forgotten about.

447
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,860
Man, I had a lot of lines this episode.

448
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,400
Nagi and,

449
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,150
Hayate's

450
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,800
Butler Network!

451
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,210
Say my name! I'm Sanzenin Nagi.

452
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,280
I'm Ayasaki Hayate.

453
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,010
Hayate no Gotoku has reached
episode 50 before anyone knew it.

454
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,770
The story's coming to the climax.

455
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:44,140
Will Hayate be able to defeat
General I-Will-Wrap-Everything-Up?

456
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,380
I'm not sure...

457
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,680
By the way, this is your character song, isn't it?

458
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,150
Yes. So you know, next week will be the last of the Butler Networks.

459
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,590
I must be the one to wrap everything up.

460
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,290
Therefore the service shot is me, too.

461
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,680
Milady, that's naughty of you.

462
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,570
No worries. Next week will be you cross-dressed bathing.

463
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,350
EHHH?!

464
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,380
See you again.

465
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,880
What? Milady's important online shopping merchandise?

466
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,600
Yes. Can you go pick it up from this shop?

467
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,400
Yes, ma'am. Right away.

468
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,360
Don't rush so much!

469
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,560
Why?

470
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,970
I don't want to see your face all of a sudden!

471
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,980
Mister Ayasaki.

472
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,870
I will give you these ¥150,000,000 as a gift to you.

473
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,260
I'm here to headhunt you for our company.

474
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,840
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

475
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,910
Spring.

476
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,290
Don't be such a stranger, Hayate!

477
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,950
I will protect Milady!
