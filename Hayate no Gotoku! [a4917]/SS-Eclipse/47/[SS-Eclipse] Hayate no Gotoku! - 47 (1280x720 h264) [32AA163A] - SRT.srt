1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,920
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,130
The government is about to make
a grave announcement to the citizens.

3
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,940
Please do not turn off the TV or change the channel.

4
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,170
Did you all know that there's a huge mansion like this in the middle of Tokyo?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,850
The name of the mistress who lives there is Sanzenin Nagi.

6
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:33,680
And...

7
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,380
Her butler's name is Ayasaki Hayate.

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,770
The two are slightly airheaded...

9
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,130
...and they misunderstand each other a bit...

10
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:47,330
...but they are bound by a tight master-butler bond.

11
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,490
What? Don't go straight to the opening as if there was nothing first.

12
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,500
Besides, what's this "grave announcement"?

13
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,090
What? Mi-Milady?

14
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,440
Oh, I've chosen my words carefully, Persian.

15
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,350
What did you just say, Milady?

16
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,820
Perhaps you should have done the same.

17
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,820
I said you don't have to work anymore.

18
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,910
This is blasphemy! This is madness!

19
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,620
Hey, why do you look depressed?

20
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,170
Does that mean... I'm fired?

21
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:51,850
Huh?

22
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,740
No, that's not what I meant.

23
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,810
Your last test was right on the passing mark, right?

24
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,530
If you fail the next exam, you'd seriously be in danger.

25
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,800
So I'm saying you can take a break from your work and concentrate on studying until exams end.

26
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,170
Wh-What are you saying, Milady? I can handle both!

27
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,150
You don't have to worry about me like that.

28
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,190
Then shall we make a deal: I'll fire you if you get a poor grade?

29
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,160
So?

30
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,450
Why not accept her offer?

31
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,120
Maria-san.

32
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,950
It's a gift from your Master.

33
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,550
Right?

34
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,080
Yeah. So relax and get lots of studying in.

35
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,790
Yes...

36
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,760
In exchange!

37
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,000
Once the exams end, I'll have you play with me a whole bunch, so be ready.

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,890
Got it?

39
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,100
Y-Yes. I got it.

40
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,440
'Sup. What's with the gloomy face?

41
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,840
I don't understand why I had to be smacked there...

42
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,710
But still, I'm a little worried.

43
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,890
Klaus-san is out and away, too.

44
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,250
Oh no, what are you talking about, Maria?

45
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,330
I'm not a child. I don't need a butler constantly by me.

46
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:09,370
So you say, but I wonder who's the person who always gets in life-threatening trouble when a butler isn't by her?

47
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,100
It's coincidence!

48
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,460
In case of a situation like this-

49
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,060
Come on Klaus, don't waste a TV.

50
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,340
Oh boy.

51
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,710
I have something prepared in case of a situation like this.

52
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,040
Prepared?

53
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,540
Yes.

54
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,140
A new emergency butler.

55
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,100
Um, was it all right to have you come with me?

56
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,920
It's fine. You're working hard for Nagi's sake, right?

57
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,620
Then it's my job as her partner to help you out.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,820
You aren't making any progress!

59
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,340
What do you think you're doing, spacing out?!

60
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,600
Is it really all right to skip work and study?

61
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,510
It looks like you don't have to worry about that.

62
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,100
I heard a new butler's coming.

63
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,480
A new butler?

64
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,030
Yeah. I overheard the SPs talking about something like that.

65
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,660
Oh really? Wow. Wow. I never knew that.

66
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,430
What? You're worried about it?

67
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,520
N-No. I'm not worried about it.

68
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,930
But, since she doesn't break the ice with people easily,
I'm sure it'll be hard for her to deal with anyone other than me.

69
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,830
So you say, but the new butler and Nagi might get along while you sit here, and...

70
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,830
I don't see anything bad in them getting along.

71
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,930
Rather than talking, I need to get to studying.

72
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,540
I have to meet Milady's standards.

73
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,670
Let's see, atarashii shitsuji: new butler.

74
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:34,880
New butler comes soon... coming soon...

75
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,550
Stop mumbling ominous stuff in English.

76
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,520
If it bothers you so much, why not go take a peek on your way to the bathroom or something?

77
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,780
But, I don't think you have to be so agitated.

78
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,480
Even Himegami asked you to take care of Nagi, right?

79
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,100
Have some confidence in yourself.

80
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,630
You're the only butler for Nagi.

81
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,810
You should trust the bond between you and Nagi more.

82
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,450
Bond between Milady and...

83
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,230
You're right.

84
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,440
I'm sorry for losing myself there.

85
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,270
Don't worry about it.

86
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,950
Let's turn our focus back on this, shall we?

87
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,560
Yes!

88
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,320
But, before that.

89
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,790
I'll go the bathroom and freshen up.
I'll pick up the pen after that.

90
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,290
After I go to the bathroom .

91
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,160
So you are still worried...

92
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,000
No, no, no!

93
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,170
I don't need a new butler!

94
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,010
I won't accept a butler other than Hayate!

95
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:41,470
B-But this new one is highly skilled,
and I'm sure he'll be more useful than Ayasaki.

96
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,890
I don't care.

97
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:46,010
I don't even want to breathe the same air
as a butler other than Hayate.

98
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,310
Besides, I'm-

99
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,550
Please don't worry.

100
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,140
I'm sure you will come to like me.

101
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,750
Y-You're!

102
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,060
Nice to meet you. I'm Mecha Butler 13.

103
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,330
Okay. Send him back to Makimura-sensei.

104
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,440
What? Lady Nagi?

105
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,700
Oh, so it was something like that.

106
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,780
This is boring.

107
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,220
I can stop worring and bury myself in studying.

108
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,240
You're right.

109
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,220
You better get some quality studying in, you hear?

110
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:17,810
Yes.

111
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,420
But, this was a bad move on Hayate's side.

112
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,850
Thank you very much.

113
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,550
You're welcome.

114
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,700
I guess it's proper manners to reply back.

115
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,850
But, was I really being thanked in the first place?

116
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,400
This is...

117
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,170
Is this a manga you drew, Lady Nagi?

118
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,840
What do you think you're doing,
reading it without my permission?

119
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,420
Go back home already, you idiot!

120
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,220
Your manga is horrible.

121
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,350
Wh-What did you say?!

122
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,770
How could a robot like you ever understand my manga?!

123
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,330
But the characters definitely had great impact.

124
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,250
I see strength in the formatting of the pages and lines, too.

125
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,350
The picture isn't bad, either.

126
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:08,150
However, the development is too sudden, so you're killing all the good parts.

127
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,420
You have to be more considerate of the reader.

128
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,590
That's how it goes?

129
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:16,030
Yes. Because you're smart, your comprehension is greater than the average person's.

130
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,060
On the other hand, readers will be seeing this for the first time,
so the same statement doesn't apply to them.

131
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,750
Have you read that manga up there?

132
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,250
No, since I can't reach.

133
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,570
Then I suggest you read it since it's a good reference.

134
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,420
It's a very good work.

135
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,310
I-Is it?

136
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,310
Here you go.

137
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,330
I guess I'll skim through it.

138
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,580
It's rose tea.

139
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,660
It'll calm you and let you read in a relaxed manner.

140
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,860
When did you make it?

141
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,210
I'm a Mecha Butler after all.

142
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:47,680
I know the way around the sky
and can move faster than humans.

143
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,470
I see.

144
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,040
W-Wow...

145
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,300
So, Maria-sama. I'd like to help with the housekeeping, if you'll let me.

146
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,520
Ah, yes.

147
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,670
Then let's start here.

148
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,760
Wh-What are you doing?

149
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,020
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,880
But please don't move.

151
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,510
You look like you have stiff shoulders.

152
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,980
Relax.

153
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,400
Y-Yes.

154
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,030
Although you can do everything yourself, it's not good to work so hard.

155
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,810
Y-You think so?

156
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,950
But wow, he's good.

157
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,860
It feels good.

158
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,570
Thank you, 13-kun.

159
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,290
It was nothing.

160
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,610
If you give the order, I can do the rest of the work myself.

161
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,130
B-But...

162
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:51,400
It's the stupid male instinct of wanting to
act cool in front of a cute girl, so please let me.

163
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,840
It feels awkward not to do any butler work.

164
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,400
Come to think of, did that robot butler leave already?

165
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,450
Hey, you're pretty good.

166
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,890
Okay, I'll win the next round.

167
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,120
I won't let you so easily.

168
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,630
Wh-What is going on...

169
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,580
They look...

170
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,590
...all so well together.

171
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:21,370
In an old episode from D****mon, there was an episode where his shadow switched places with him.

172
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,410
Don't say such an ominous thing!

173
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,910
Su-susu... Sumo-ru Raito.

174
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,910
Su-susu... Sumo-ru Raito. = S-S-S-Small Light.

175
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,850
Tototto totto. Toutou boku no sonzaiga.

176
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,850
Tototto totto. Toutou boku no sonzaiga. = M-M-M-My existence is...

177
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,800
What? Hayate's feeling jealous?

178
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:02,540
Yeah. Looks like how you're all getting along with that robot is hitting him really hard.

179
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,110
Oh my.

180
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,280
On another note, butler robot, eh?

181
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,530
Sanzenin technology's really amazing.

182
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,440
Thank you for your compliment.

183
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,900
So, how good are you, exactly?

184
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,920
Someone tell her.

185
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,700
I'm asking you, fool!

186
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,700
I jabbed at him instinctively.

187
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,660
As expected from Lady Sakuya.

188
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,900
You don't miss the smallest opportunity.

189
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,960
H-He did that on purpose?

190
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,960
He is excellent!

191
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,930
This butler robot is extremely excellent!

192
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,130
Hayate is feeling jealous over me?

193
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,850
Jealous, eh...

194
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,410
Gosh, he's such a cute guy.

195
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,190
Excuse me, Milady.

196
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,320
Why do you look so happy?

197
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,510
Well, Hayate's being jealous. It gets me going a little.

198
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,140
You're such a naughty girl.

199
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,190
Gets you going...

200
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,000
Is that a positive emotion to humans?

201
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,540
Oh, there are things even 13-kun doesn't know?

202
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:12,820
Yes. My main computer does not come with an algorithm that promotes negative emotions towards people installed.

203
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,760
I don't think it needs to be installed.

204
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,650
This is correct, too.

205
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,740
Good, I got them all right.

206
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:32,340
I can concentrate more when I'm a little down.

207
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,200
Humans are made strangely.

208
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,170
Yes, his back looks melancholic.

209
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,830
So that's what jealousy looks like.

210
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,240
I see, I see.

211
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,340
Stop grinning and go comfort him already.

212
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,250
Yeah. Since I'm sure it's about time he gets tired from all the studying.

213
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,180
I guess I'll make some tea for him.

214
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,080
Please wait a moment, Milady.

215
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,990
What's wrong, 13?

216
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,580
If you go now and comfort him, you're only playing the game as he wants it played.

217
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,580
I see. A gamble between grown-ups, eh?

218
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,490
Yes.

219
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,400
So let us...

220
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,760
Yes?

221
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,600
Um, Hayate-kun.

222
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,350
I made some tea.

223
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,810
Maria-san? Thank you. Sorry to make you have-

224
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,280
No need to worry ~nya.

225
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:24,130
A-Are you making progress with your studies ~nya?

226
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,150
Y-Yes...

227
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,950
How is this a brilliant idea, 13-kun?

228
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,240
What is Hayate doing?

229
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,370
He's licking Maria with his eyes.

230
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,260
No, he isn't.

231
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,880
I'm going to quit ~nya!

232
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,050
Damn Hayate! How dare he drool over Maria!

233
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,550
Hold on, Milady.

234
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,650
I'm sorry. Looks like this strategy failed.

235
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,990
Okay, that got one person out of here.

236
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,630
Let's try a different strategy this time.

237
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,000
I get it! A night snack.

238
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,430
Although, it's not night yet.

239
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,870
Then I shall put everything I've got into it and-

240
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,000
Denied.

241
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,690
What?

242
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,560
Why? I was about to make a dish filled with love for him.

243
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,710
That's exactly why!

244
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,020
Everyone can expect an explosive ending out of this!

245
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,250
Don't misjudge me!

246
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,650
You can't even prepare a cup noodle!

247
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,520
What did you say?!

248
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,730
May I ask for Lady Sakuya's assistance?

249
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,620
Me?

250
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,680
Wow, this is amazing.

251
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,700
You made all of this?

252
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,940
Yeah. Chow down and keep up the hard studying.

253
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,150
You're a great cook, Sakuya-san.

254
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,940
This isn't much.

255
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,360
What are you doing, getting energized by Saku?

256
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,020
Looks like that Hayate-san gets along with Lady Sakuya very well.

257
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,170
D-Don't be ridiculous!

258
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,560
Hayate is... Hayate is my...

259
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,280
Wow, this is really relaxing.

260
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,280
It's no time to relax!

261
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,610
Why, Hayate? Why?

262
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,360
Mi... Milady... What are you mad about?

263
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:17,840
She doesn't look too pleased, so it might be better to have you leave for the moment.

264
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,060
She's such a child.

265
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,260
That's because you're more mature than Lady Nagi.

266
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,940
You're such a flatterer.

267
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,940
All right then. I guess I'll step out.

268
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,810
There goes the second one.

269
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,430
All that's left is...

270
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,320
Besides, have you made any progress in studying?

271
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,310
Yes, so-so.

272
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,950
Hey, you've got lots of stuff down.

273
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,160
Yes. Thanks to Sakuya-san drilling them into me.

274
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,060
How about me?

275
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,400
Do you like Saku's favors better than mine?

276
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,070
What?

277
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,500
Milady?

278
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,590
I-I never said anything like that.

279
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,210
Hayate, you idiot!

280
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,290
Mi...la...dy...

281
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,920
Why, Hayate? Why?

282
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,250
Oh dear.

283
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,160
13.

284
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,540
Looks like he's a really impotent butler.

285
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,690
No, that's not true.

286
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,090
He doesn't look too smart, either.

287
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,990
Wouldn't he fail as a Sanzenin butler at this rate?

288
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,880
13... What are you saying?

289
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,240
At this rate, wouldn't I be a better choice as a butler for you?

290
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,660
What?

291
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,070
Hey!

292
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,190
Let's forget about him.

293
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,030
I'm more capable than him.

294
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,720
But!

295
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,090
How pathetic. He looks so depressed because of something like this.

296
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,040
Hayate...

297
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,170
Yes... If I do think about what's best for Milady...

298
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,720
Hayate, you can't.

299
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,160
Even if I'm around, she won't overcome the foods she doesn't like...

300
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,900
She watches TV until late at night...

301
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,150
Skips school and plays MMOs all day long.

302
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:07,450
She's starting to develop an interest in
the Maiden Road and making SPs go secretly buy goods, too.

303
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,870
Also, behind the cabinet is-

304
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,960
Enough! That's enough!

305
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,710
Milady...

306
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,120
You are my butler.

307
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,290
You're the only one.

308
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,070
It's a better fit for me not to be completely capable.

309
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:24,820
Milady...

310
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,460
Hayate.

311
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,650
Milady, was that a compliment?

312
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,400
Well, um...

313
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,110
Hayate.

314
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,850
Yes?

315
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,400
Anyway, right now, focus on studying.

316
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,780
Yes, you're right.

317
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,520
Did he arrange that for my sake?

318
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,890
"It's a better fit for me not to be completely capable", eh?

319
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,480
Humans are complicated.

320
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,890
Eight! Please, stop!

321
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,320
Let me go, Honey!

322
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,220
If it's going to take you away, then I'll break him and then I'll...

323
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,680
I'll...

324
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,880
Eight!

325
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,410
Eight, you idiot!

326
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,180
Are you all right, 13?

327
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,680
Why was he angry?

328
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,320
I didn't do anything to him.

329
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,650
I'm sorry. I think he was jealous of you since I paid so much attention to you.

330
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,750
Jealousy?

331
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,580
I can't comprehend it. That emotion is not yet installed.

332
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,770
Don't worry. I don't understand it well myself.

333
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,720
Plus, he's not as well-made as you.

334
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,160
I still don't understand it, no matter how well I'm made.

335
00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:01,220
My existence here will only lead to being in the way of Milady's happiness.

336
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:05,670
I'll leave the rest to Hayate-san, and I'll just...

337
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,330
We have an emergency!

338
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,020
What? What's going on?

339
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:18,190
A large meteor is closing in on Earth!

340
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,280
It will crash into the Nerima Ward in Tokyo in a few minutes.

341
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,420
What?!

342
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,660
It's within sight!

343
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,140
What kind of turnaround is this?

344
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,270
Or rather, I'm surprised that the scene before the opening had meaning.

345
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,970
It'll crash at this rate.

346
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,550
Let's get out of here fast.

347
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,950
No. Judging by its mass, running away won't get us anywhere in time.

348
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,770
What?

349
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,480
Then what do we do?

350
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,710
Hayate-san. Please take care of everyone.

351
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,700
Y-You aren't going to...

352
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:55,710
I'll destroy the meteor in outer space before it causes any damage to the surface.

353
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:00,280
If I use my self-destruct module, it should possible.

354
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,410
Self-destruct?

355
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,680
S-Stop it!

356
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,400
You can't go, 13!

357
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,730
This is your Master's order!

358
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:06,780
Milady.

359
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:11,410
It's a butler's job to protect
the Master even at the cost their life.

360
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,980
Forgive me for disobeying you.

361
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,100
You can't! I won't let you go!

362
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,620
I won't forgive you if you go!

363
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,450
You can't, 13!

364
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,910
Hayate-san. Please take Milady away.

365
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:36,160
Milady, you need to get away.

366
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,480
Let go! Let go!

367
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:46,360
If I have the chance to be reborn,
I'll be sure to get the emotion of jealousy installed.

368
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,280
I wish the best to you all.

369
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,100
13...

370
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,800
Farewell, everyone.

371
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,930
13!

372
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,840
Farewell, Lady Nagi.

373
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,060
He was such a good guy.

374
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,190
13-kun...

375
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,530
Milady...

376
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,180
13-san.

377
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:38,730
The huge meteor disappeared for an unknown reason right before crashing into the Earth.

378
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:46,710
Thanks to Mecha Butler's courageous act,
Earth's peace and the happiness of Lady Sanzenin were saved.

379
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,090
Thank you, 13.

380
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,920
Farewell, Mecha Butler 13.

381
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:30,960
Nagi and,

382
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,030
Hayate's

383
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,320
Butler Network!

384
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,800
The burning heat! I'm Sanzenin Nagi.

385
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,590
I'm Ayasaki Hayate.

386
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,060
Hey, this is Hayate's character song.

387
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:43,910
The Hayate no Gotoku character song rush ended, so they were able to play my song again.

388
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,670
Maybe they just couldn't get the next song ready in time.

389
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:48,050
That's not true. Although there are some people who haven't gone yet.

390
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,250
Anyhow, we prepared Hayate's service shot today.

391
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:54,860
Cross-dressing Hayate is good too, but for the female Hayate fans around the world, today's is Hayate in his butler uniform.

392
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,790
When did you take this picture, Milady?

393
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,580
But I do like it better than the cross-dressing one.

394
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,750
Bye bye.

395
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,460
This is... a letter without a "sender" name?

396
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:10,060
Someone's got some courage to send me a love letter.

397
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,330
But who?

398
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,160
Could it be-

399
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,210
Hinagiku-san.

400
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,170
Hayate-kun?

401
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,040
So this letter is from you?

402
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,730
Next week, Hina Love.

403
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,850
Episode 48 is a must-see episode for Hinagiku fans.

404
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,390
Though, I don't have much screentime.

405
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,780
Next week, Ai! Zen! Claws! to Hayate no Gotoku.
