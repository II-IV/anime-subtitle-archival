1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:10,050
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,750
So good~

3
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,110
It's already February...

4
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,640
I've yet to see Hayate-kun once this year.

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,710
But soon, the greatest opportunity of the year will come!

6
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,080
Yes, the biggest event for all girls in February is-

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,440
Gosh, mister. What do you think you're doing in front of a girl?

8
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,550
Me?

9
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,770
Oni stay out!

10
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:53,530
Setsubun: An activity to ward off Oni by throwing roasted beans on February 3rd.

11
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,290
Luck stays in!

12
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,530
Oni stay out!

13
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,930
Um, why are we doing this now?

14
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,170
What are you talking about, Maria?

15
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,670
She's right. The biggest event in February has to be this.

16
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:10,250
That is all right, but Nagi, it's getting late, so please start getting ready for bed.

17
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,680
Yes. Then let's end this by eating your age's worth in beans.

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,350
Here.

19
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,350
Yes.

20
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,520
How about you, Maria?

21
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,130
Okay, I guess I will, too.

22
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,290
What's wrong, all of you?

23
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,770
What were you staring at?

24
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,940
N-Nothing!

25
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,140
Nothing at all!

26
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,870
Don't tell me you were thinking that there's not enough beans.

27
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,480
No, absolutely not!

28
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,820
No matter who looks at you, you're a fresh seventeen year old.

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,380
Then why are you drenched in sweat?

30
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,440
All of you, go to bed now!

31
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,000
An Oni was inside.

32
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:11,640
Did you all know that there's a huge mansion like this in the middle of Tokyo?

33
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,900
The name of the mistress who lives there is Sanzenin Nagi.

34
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,750
And...

35
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,930
Her butler's name is Ayasaki Hayate.

36
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,860
The two are slightly airheaded...

37
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,130
...and they misunderstand each other a bit...

38
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:28,210
...but they are bound by a tight master-butler bond.

39
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,430
Seriously, why are they such...

40
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,360
Ow! Oh no, my lower back. It hurts...

41
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,940
Gosh darn. We made Maria mad again.

42
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,390
You don't say.

43
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,400
Don't give her too much trouble.

44
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,100
She's not forever young.

45
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,350
Don't say such a scary thing!

46
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,630
But, Maria has been working without any breaks.

47
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:32,440
She may be the best of all professional maids, but she must be letting fatigue pile up.

48
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,420
We are always in her great care,
so it'd be nice if we could show our appreciation.

49
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,620
Okay! Then I shall become a maid and-

50
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,830
If you do that, Maria-san will become even more tired.

51
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,010
But she's not the kind of person who will take a break even if you tell her to.

52
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,210
E-Exactly as you say.

53
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,120
Oh right. That's a perfect plan!

54
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,270
A plan?

55
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,380
Approximately one hour later.

56
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,480
What is this about?

57
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,520
Where are we going all of a sudden?

58
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,720
I wonder where.

59
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,060
It'll be a surprise for when we get there.

60
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,640
Where is this?

61
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,380
Tonight, we're staying here!

62
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,470
The thing is, Saki-san gave us some input.

63
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,010
Ladies Overnight Plan, Relaxation Tour?

64
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,380
A friend of mine went there the other day.

65
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,710
Stay at an expensive hotel in the middle of the city, enjoy the spa and aesthetic salon,

66
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,860
forget about work, and relax.

67
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:47,430
I heard it's popular among young working women as a gift to themselves for working hard.

68
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,610
Young...

69
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,990
...working women.

70
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,510
Young... Young... Young...

71
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,300
That's the key word?

72
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,900
Yes, this is it!

73
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,960
Get right to it, Hayate.

74
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,660
Yes.

75
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:05,980
Therefore, we call it, "Maria-san, thank you so much all the time. Gratitude to our Onee-sama, Relax Plan."

76
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,580
What? But, um...

77
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:12,820
This is a present from Milady as a sign of our gratitude.

78
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,610
Maria, thank you so much for working so hard for us all the time.

79
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,900
But for today and tomorrow, forget about your work and enjoy a vacation in the city.

80
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,950
Thank you very much.

81
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,680
Then I'll take your offer and have a good rest.

82
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,380
Yes. Relax all you like.

83
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,680
Let us go then.

84
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,390
Yes.

85
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,310
Welcome.

86
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,600
Who knew that Hayata-kun and the others would come to stay.

87
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,090
I'll take the room over there.

88
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,720
I guess Maria and I will use that room then.

89
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,420
First, let me get some tea ready.

90
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,520
Maria-san, you're on vacation, so please don't do anything.

91
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,780
Ah, yes, that's right.

92
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,570
Hayate prepared lots of things.

93
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,500
Hello? This is the imperial suite; I'd like to order room service.

94
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,500
The pool, jacuzzi, gym, aesthetic salon, and nail salon.

95
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,580
A pot of royal milk tea, please.

96
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,130
You can use any facility as much as you want.

97
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,990
Apparently this hotel's sales point is service towards young women.

98
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:19,210
It's perfect for a young working woman like Maria.

99
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,840
You don't have to emphasize "young" so much.

100
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,880
Excuse me. It's room service.

101
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,330
Yes, thank you.

102
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,390
So? Don't I look good in this? Did I surprise you?

103
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,080
Class rep? What are you doing here?

104
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,180
It's a one day experience event at school.

105
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,660
I've seen it on the news before.

106
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,310
Ah!

107
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,130
What is it, Hayate?

108
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:52,150
Oh, well for some reason, today's a 5%-off service day.

109
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,560
That's the reason I chose this place, but...

110
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,770
Makes sense.

111
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,480
Exactly. Today, this hotel is covered by Hakuou.

112
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,800
I saw Hayata-kun and his group here just a while ago.

113
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,660
Oh...

114
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,660
I was hoping Oo**** or Yoshi**** were coming.

115
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,450
Yoshi****? Because we're right in front of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building?

116
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,410
Oh whatever. Where's Hina, by the way?

117
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,840
She got trapped with the manager.

118
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:22,260
Looking back at it now, it was back when
the Tokyo Olympics were going on that I started this job.

119
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,030
I can't get a sense of the timeframe at all.

120
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:28,390
Hayate, you've got to get this right!
We need to have Maria enjoy the vacation.

121
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,680
I'm sorry. My habit of saving on things took over.

122
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,390
Hot!

123
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,590
I'll do it.

124
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,250
Thank you, Maria-san.

125
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,940
See what I mean?

126
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,140
I'll do it, Maria-san!

127
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,980
By the way, what did all of you come here for?

128
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,560
Well...

129
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,120
That's such a great story.

130
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,700
I'm touched!

131
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,440
I'll help you out.

132
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,510
I'll tell everyone, too!

133
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,460
Segawa-san!

134
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,220
I have a...

135
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,920
...really bad feeling about this.

136
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,990
Um... If it's about me, please don't worry. I'm already relaxing.

137
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,200
No! We can't give up now!

138
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,330
We must protect Maria's break no matter what!

139
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,310
Let's split up!

140
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,920
Milady and Maria-san, please proceed on to Plan 2!

141
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,530
We'll meet back here in three hours!

142
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,880
Leave it to me, Hayate!

143
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,050
Wait!

144
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:23,350
Wh-Why is this starting to feel like a battle?

145
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,610
She's right. This is a form of battle.

146
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,690
How is it, Maria? Relaxing?

147
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,620
Yes, thank you!

148
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,160
Oh wow! It's like a rose bath.

149
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,200
But wait, this is the pool.

150
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,670
Strange. I don't recall asking for service like that.

151
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,270
No need for your thanks.

152
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,480
Take this instead.

153
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,310
Excuse me, but who are you?

154
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,960
Himuro, is this enough?

155
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,850
Yes. Was it educational, Sir Taiga?

156
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,080
Yes. Working sure is hard.

157
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,920
Meanwhile, Hayate was...

158
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,360
Oh no... People from Hakuou are here, too.

159
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,330
What's the matter, Sir?

160
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,660
At that rate, you can't possibly give the customers satisfactory service.

161
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,300
Leg... my leg... This is impossible...

162
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,150
Okay. Next we'll go for the aesthetic salon.

163
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,700
Make sure you get relaxed this time!

164
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,150
Y-Yes. But, Nagi...

165
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:39,330
Why the Super Special Marvelous Anti-Aging Course?

166
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,090
Don't let the details bother you!

167
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,800
I'll be in the room next door!

168
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,190
Thank you for coming.

169
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,800
What? You're the trash robot!

170
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,750
Please come right over here.

171
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,930
Hey, you're surprisingly pretty good.

172
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:56,730
Of course, since I always give massages to Makimura-san.

173
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,310
I guess I'll go get relaxed, too.

174
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,650
Hey.

175
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,590
I heard the story from Segawa-san.

176
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,700
Wh-Why is even Katsura-sensei here?

177
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:22,090
It was an opportunity to try, and also,
I wanted to learn some new skills in case I get fired.

178
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,470
Come on. Leave everything to me.
I'll do everything to make you relax.

179
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,710
I feel a serious error... I mean...
a serious danger threatening me.

180
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,720
Ahhh. This is so relaxing.

181
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:43,790
This is so good~

182
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,060
Looks like being a teacher really wears you out.

183
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:51,080
And before I know it, I'm already twenty-eight.

184
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:56,190
Makes me wonder if I can continue to live the way I do.

185
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:03,270
But, you are who you are, so no matter how much you worry, you can't become another individual.

186
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,610
So please always be yourself.

187
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,240
But do watch out how much you drink.

188
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,040
You feel this? It's the pressure point for your liver.

189
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,750
Thank you, Maria-san!

190
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,330
It... It feels like I just met a role model for life!

191
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:24,090
Um, I'm more than ten years younger than you!

192
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,940
Hey, Maria, is something wrong?

193
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,230
I just sensed a strange atmosphere.

194
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,160
N-No, it's nothing.

195
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,270
I just sensed a bad omen.

196
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,880
Your new dress looks great on you, Kuzuha-sama.

197
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,880
It's specially made by COSPA.

198
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,820
I must be dressed in formal attire like this all the time.

199
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,970
You look so great, Kuzuha-sama.

200
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:02,740
Okay, Shion. Before we start the tour, let's go raise our blood sugar level.

201
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,830
Yes, Kuzuha-sama.

202
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,460
Oh yuck.

203
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,870
It's heading away from relaxation and continues on.

204
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,870
Nonbiri yuttari.

205
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,870
Nonbiri yuttari. = Relax and make yourself at home.

206
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,970
Rizumu de shiritori suta-to.

207
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,970
Rizumu de shiritori suta-to. = Starting rhythmical shiritori.

208
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,810
Tan tan tan nta. Matteru.

209
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,810
Tan tan tan nta. Matteru. = Tan tan tan nta. Now waiting.

210
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:25,520
I hope they're both enjoying the city vacation.

211
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,380
Hey, Hayate! I'm back.

212
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,050
Welcome back. But where's Maria-san?

213
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:36,800
She said she'll take a stroll in the garden to relax.

214
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,560
"Relax", she said?!

215
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,130
Yes. "Relax" it is!

216
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:51,000
Hold on! Since Maria won't be coming back to the room for a while...

217
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,120
Hayate and I are alone!

218
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,610
I'll make some tea right away.

219
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:00,420
Plus, we're in a suite that newly-wed couples are likely to stay in!

220
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,410
Is something wrong?

221
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,660
Nothing!

222
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:14,540
It's not easy to take a break.

223
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,000
But, since the two of them are being considerate...

224
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:24,330
During the time I'm here, I must respond to their thoughts by having a slow day.

225
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,080
Um...

226
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,330
Isumi-san!

227
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:34,210
Um... Um... There's something I'd like to ask.
Might this be where Hakuou's practical training event is?

228
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,090
Yes, it is.

229
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm so happy!

230
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,260
I was finally able to make it to a destination in episode 45.

231
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,450
I thought I would never make it in time.

232
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,740
A-Anyway, let's go to the front desk together.

233
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:58,000
But it's a surprise that you're going to be part of an event like this.

234
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,950
I wanted to learn about society through the event.

235
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,640
Maria-san.

236
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,550
Oh, the Hakuou students.

237
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,000
Maria-san!

238
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,550
Maria-san.

239
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,090
Is something wrong?

240
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,680
You seem to be distracted.

241
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,560
Because it's too quiet in here.

242
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,700
Let's turn the TV on.

243
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,530
I love you!

244
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,040
Oh no. This would get Hayate in the mood.

245
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,030
As much as we love each other, it's too early for us.

246
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,370
It's too early!

247
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,540
Oh, I like this actress quite a bit.

248
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,890
Ever since she broke up with the kabuki actor,
she's been doing much better.

249
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,720
Gosh, what is Maria doing? How long does she have to relax until she's satisfied?

250
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,120
She was not relaxing at all.

251
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:53,250
See? The trick is to tuck both bed sheets and the cover and line them up properly.

252
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,630
Thank you, Maria-san.

253
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:59,180
I just double booked a room by mistake.

254
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:06,270
Hello. We're very sorry. We can get a room with
twin beds ready instead of double beds, if that's all right.

255
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,810
Thank you, Maria-san.

256
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:16,030
Ah, yes. The year I came over here was the year of the Osaka Expo, 1971.

257
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,120
Oh please, Manager.

258
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,950
The Osaka Expo was in 1970.

259
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:26,710
If I remember correctly, the total number of guests was 64,218,770 people.

260
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:31,620
The number of countries participating, including Japan, was 77 countries and 4 international authorities.

261
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,740
E-Excuse me for a moment!

262
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,440
Thank you so much, Maria-san.

263
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,010
But, isn't today your day off? You don't need to go rest?

264
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,220
Please keep this a secret from Nagi and Hayate-kun.

265
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,350
We're in trouble, Manager!

266
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,660
Mari-pon. What are you doing here?

267
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,610
Mari-pon?!

268
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,340
Hello, Makimura-san.

269
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,750
Um, you two know each other?

270
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,430
Yes, through certain circumstances.

271
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:04,620
Thank goodness. I want to ask you a favor regarding something, Maria-chi.

272
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,810
Maria-chi?!

273
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,230
Is there something wrong?

274
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,580
Well, the cafeteria is high schooling and is in trouble!

275
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,350
Milady. Please stop staying on six.

276
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,860
I don't know what you're talking about.

277
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,900
Who else can it be?

278
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,300
Hello?

279
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,790
Ah, Mari-

280
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,840
Shh! Keep it a secret that this call is from me.

281
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,180
Well, you see...

282
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,890
What happened to Maria-san?

283
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,610
M-Maria-san.

284
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:46,020
I was cleaning up a room
and found a customer's forgotten item.

285
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,540
What was the room number?

286
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,050
Let's look up the contact information.

287
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,880
Um, where is the Concierge?

288
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,980
I sent him over that way.

289
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,550
Um, sorry to bother you.

290
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,860
Nihao. Wo jiao Maria.

291
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,860
Note: This is Chinese for "Hello. My name is Maria."

292
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,390
Maria-san.

293
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,170
Please keep this a secret from Nagi.

294
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,590
Of course.

295
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,720
So, why did you call me?

296
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,230
May I ask for a favor?

297
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,370
Where's the next treat?

298
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,800
We're sorry!

299
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:21,930
We were making sweets at high speed to keep up with your orders, but the pÃ¢tissier collapsed from being overloaded.

300
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,930
Weak! I've not yet had enough!

301
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,980
Sorry for the wait.

302
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,720
This is a hidden menu, special Mont Blanc.

303
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,690
Th-This is...

304
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:41,070
This is concentrated yet simple,
while the sweetness covers the tongue like velvet!

305
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,400
It's that good?!

306
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,140
So good~

307
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,520
I'm satisfied.

308
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,700
I quit the tour. Before I snap out of this enchanted feeling, I'm heading back to the academy.

309
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,600
Y-Yes.

310
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,200
Wow, Maria-san's recipe works great.

311
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,120
After all, its effect was proven in the past.

312
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,560
Oh, nothing.

313
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,120
What are you doing here, Makimura-sensei?

314
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,980
Well, I'm just reading books and eating cake.

315
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,580
Aren't you supposed to be advising the practical?

316
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,650
You're flabbergasted, aren't you?

317
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,000
Cake is important for the brain, you know?

318
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,330
Please show him to the bathroom right away.

319
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,080
Yes, Ma'am!

320
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,450
Maria! So it was you!

321
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:32,410
That cake tasted the same as the one
I had tasted at a school festival in the past.

322
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,950
It has been a while.

323
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,520
It was the most delectable sweet I've had in a while. Thank you.

324
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,210
You should be happy!

325
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,830
I guess I'll head back over to Nagi.

326
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,570
Nothing special happened thereafter and the day ended.

327
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,620
I'm so tired. I'm so hungry.

328
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,470
Then let's all grab something to eat.

329
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,840
But...

330
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,140
You don't have money, right?

331
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,130
We'll treat you.

332
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:05,880
Really?

333
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,170
Yahoo!

334
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,680
Onee-chan...

335
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,050
Doesn't she have any pride as a fully grown adult?

336
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:15,030
I don't care! I'm going to live as who I am.

337
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:25,220
How rare to see her fall asleep at this hour.

338
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,140
Did she get tired from an environment she's not used to?

339
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,140
Milady was very excited about the plan, after all.

340
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,680
She was committed to having Maria-san enjoy the day.

341
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,290
I'll see you tomorrow.

342
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,100
Yes. Good night.

343
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,040
I see, Maria.

344
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,990
So your fatigue has blown away, huh?

345
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,530
That's good. I'm always so grateful to you.

346
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,750
The mansion feels the best.

347
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,160
Then what about the Thank You Tour?

348
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,190
Thank you very much, both of you.

349
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,950
I'm the one who should be thanking you.

350
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,960
But, Nagi, Hayate-kun, and the smiles of everyone at the mansion...

351
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,950
Those are the best presents for me.

352
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,920
That's great!

353
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,370
Please continue to look after us, Maria-san.

354
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:28,930
Of course.

355
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,150
By the way, Maria, your skin looks so smooth.

356
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:36,380
Did the Super Special Marvelous
Anti-Aging Course have an effect?

357
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,940
You're almost like a young girl!

358
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:41,460
Yes, you look as if you've lost few years, Maria-san.

359
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,980
I see... So a seventeen year old isn't a young girl anymore.

360
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,800
Or am I...

361
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,400
No, no, Maria, you got it wrong.

362
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,450
On that note, next week, we'll fight against the sweat perspired from youth.

363
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,090
Student Council Trio's

364
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,060
Butler Network!

365
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,130
Howdy everyone. It's Segawa Izumi.

366
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,240
Hey. It's Asakaze Risa.

367
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,660
I'm the warrior of freedom, Hanabishi Miki.

368
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,660
All of you in front to the TV,
you've memorized our image song, right?

369
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,140
Since I'm sure they're listening to it at least a hundred times a day.

370
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,810
A happy bit of news for people like that!

371
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,590
If you collect ten dust covers and send them in...

372
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,950
...you won't win anything in particular!

373
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,070
That's amazing!

374
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,920
You all must have been waiting. Here's this week's service shot.

375
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,590
Oh, this is erotic.

376
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,810
Starting out so bold so early in the morning.

377
00:23:58,810 --> 00:23:59,850
Bye bye!

378
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,160
What's going on? Tell me!

379
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,800
You ask the strangest questions sometimes.

380
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,570
Something has to be wrong!

381
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,680
Isumi was wearing a blazer and went off on a bus without getting lost at all!

382
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,600
Maybe she fell in love with a boy in another school
and is sneaking into the school wearing their uniform.

383
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,370
What?!

384
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,900
Next time, his name is miracle ball pitcher, Wataru!

385
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,370
Why won't Sir consult with me?

386
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:24,910
It's like it's easier to talk with Lady Nagi,
who is the same age as him.

387
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:28,850
Therefore, next week, Cross Triangle to Hayate no Gotoku!
