1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,130
When watching TV,

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,570
make sure the room is well lit,

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,830
and watch from a distance.

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:09,650
Got it?

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,330
I will teach everyone what true culture is.

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,000
And you. Finish coloring in the dark spots.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,800
What?

8
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,830
Kuzuha-sama!

9
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,540
I was tiring of normal culture festivals.

10
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:30,460
Besides, right now, that head-to-toe Milady boy must be...

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,610
Milady.

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,960
How could you abandon me?

13
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,190
Yes, I like it.

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,760
Kuzuha-sama...

15
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,110
Color in the dark spots on this one, too.

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,660
One who masters being a butler becomes the master of the world.

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,000
The Butler War that shakes the planet has started!

18
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,260
Just you watch! I will take over this world with my manga!

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,540
Are you seriously under hypnosis?

20
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,420
Aren't you a little too worried?

21
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,070
We did receive a personal call from her last night.

22
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,650
Still, don't you find it strange?

23
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,660
That Milady is actively taking part in a school event...

24
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,020
...and is spending the night out trying to make the culture festival more interesting in collaboration with the Superintendent!

25
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,890
Where in that sentence do you find an element to worry about?

26
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,820
Nothing if you just read the words, but...

27
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,050
Well, Klaus-san doesn't know the Superintendent's nature, so...

28
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,970
And also Nagi has a bit of a problem in her daily life.

29
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:19,840
But, to know that Superintendent's character. As expected of you.

30
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,320
When it comes to the ability to cause trouble to others, she beats everyone else by leagues.

31
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,720
Excuse me.

32
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,520
Hinagiku-san?

33
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,030
Yes? Good morning.

34
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,110
Hayate-kun, we don't have time for greetings.

35
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,930
What's the problem, Hinagiku-san?

36
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,970
Look.

37
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
Th-This is...

38
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,400
Um, this is Hakuou Academy, right?

39
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,910
You think it's a strange building, too, right?

40
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:57,850
I think there is more to be surprised over than the building.

41
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,570
This is Nagi's doing, isn't it?

42
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,120
Why?

43
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,140
I saw a lot of cars parked out front
with many anime character drawings on them.

44
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,990
That's what all anime lovers' cars look like, right?

45
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:12,330
I-I think it's only a fraction of them.

46
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:20,200
In any case, a view similar to the manga festival likely to happen at the end of this year at Tokyo *** Site was there.

47
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,350
Doujinshi everywhere.

48
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,620
Character goods such as body pillows.

49
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,190
Doujin music CDs.

50
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,310
Limited edition figures at corporate booths.

51
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,530
Limited edition DVDs with special features.

52
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:35,720
We're selling the limited edition CD.

53
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,300
And, over at our Rondo Robe booth, they're selling limited edition CDs.

54
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,760
Those who are finding this more familiar than others, don't worry.

55
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,970
And, parents make sure you do not check what your children buy after they come here.

56
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,110
It could become the reason why they start being hikikomori.

57
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,200
The people look like trash from here.

58
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,220
There aren't enough girls' bathrooms.

59
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,130
There are people changing outside the locker room.

60
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,000
Do something about the resellers.

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,210
I couldn't buy Ka**mi goods.

62
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,780
And there are complaints regarding changes, too.

63
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,010
That's enough.

64
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:07,380
Besides, those are all completely unrelated to our culture festival.

65
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,620
You're right.

66
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,520
The Superintendent, who set up an event this large scale overnight, is amazing,

67
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,310
but the guests who found out about it
and came are amazing, as well.

68
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,000
You don't have to respect them for that.

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,130
If we don't do anything, it'll become like this every year.

70
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,990
We'll make such large profits.

71
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,300
That's not my point!

72
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,770
If we have so many people here,
it'll get so dangerous, we might get injured people.

73
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,910
I have to do something about this.

74
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,270
Um, I'll go search for Milady.

75
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:39,570
I think the reason behind all of this is Milady assisting the Superintendent,

76
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:44,310
and the cause for that is me leaving her alone.

77
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,830
To cause your master to lose interest in you...

78
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,300
You fail as a butler.

79
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,880
Poem person.

80
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,040
We have Sanzenin Nagi in our care.

81
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,410
Yes, we know that. We received a call.

82
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,540
A call?

83
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,210
That's an example of being lame.

84
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,870
Or a doofus.

85
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,700
Maybe she's just stupid.

86
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,150
She has to be a natural airhead.

87
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,950
The ahoge is the proof.

88
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,950
Note: An "ahoge" is a lock of hair sticking out from the top of the head

89
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,790
Shut up!

90
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,060
Oh, damn it.

91
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,460
And I came all the way over to sneak you over to where she is.

92
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:29,630
Why?

93
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,400
We're facing so much trouble thanks to her.

94
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,510
So take her away already!

95
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,850
I can't believe that this is the same campus.

96
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,180
Kuzuha-sama is having a snack in the dining hall,

97
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,450
so take her away now.

98
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,270
Yes, it's wonderful.

99
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,830
This is the pinnacle of Japanese culture!

100
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,060
Really now. What do you think you're doing in a place like this?

101
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,390
Let's go home.

102
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,040
Milady.

103
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,340
Who are you guys?

104
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,040
Wh-What are you saying?

105
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,870
Please. I'm Hayate, your butler.

106
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,870
Don't try to lie to me.

107
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,020
You can't possibly be Hayate.

108
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,150
I bet you're a fake.

109
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,300
The real... The real Hayate would...

110
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,030
No matter how busy he might be due to the culture festival, he wouldn't...

111
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,350
He wouldn't leave me alone.

112
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,040
Milady.

113
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,700
Hayate-kun...

114
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,250
Hey, hurry up! If you take your time, Kuzuha-sama will come back.

115
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,770
No mischief, Shion.

116
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,520
I'm sorry, Kuzuha-sama.

117
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,790
Boy, it looks like you really made your master angry.

118
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,880
She's saying that she won't return to the mansion anymore.

119
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,500
You're joking.

120
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,960
Sanzenin! You're going to show everyone how great your manga is, right?

121
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,330
That's right. I'm going to continue drawing manga here.

122
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,700
You can do that at your mansion, too.

123
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:15,540
Sh-Shut up! Splitting private life and business is a basic thing to do for a manga artist!

124
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,830
You're a student of Hakuou before you're a manga artist!

125
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,850
And you, too, Superintendent, gathering so many people.

126
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,550
What are you going to do if any injuries occur?

127
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,020
Interesting.

128
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,720
Then why don't we have a match?!

129
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,760
A match?

130
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,020
I'm not telling you to cancel...

131
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,180
I'm only saying that things are dangerous as they are now.

132
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:43,290
We will now sell Sanzenin Nagi's doujinshi at the school special booth.

133
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:51,310
Ayasaki. If your doujinshi beats us in overall sales, we will return your master and fix the culture festival, as well.

134
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,000
What is with this development?

135
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,180
It's just like Co*** **rty.

136
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,000
So this is a doujinshi sales showdown.

137
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,040
That's right.

138
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,170
My manga can't possibly lose to a fake!

139
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,260
Um, Superintendent. Are you listening to me at all?

140
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,440
You dare to run away? You coward!

141
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,800
Looks like she is not and has no intention to.

142
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,040
Seems so.

143
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,370
Very well. We accept your challenge.

144
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,700
Eh? Hi-Hinagiku-san?

145
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,050
However, to make things fair,

146
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:33,150
we, the student council, will organize everything to keep things under control and fair, including this big wild party.

147
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,530
Go ahead.

148
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:39,990
But, if you guys lose, the student council members will run a maid cafe in really embarrassing outfits!

149
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,430
If you can't accept that condition,
then I have no intention of listening to you.

150
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,180
What'll you do?

151
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,430
Even so...

152
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,800
Even so, the safety of the guests is important!

153
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,320
Hinagiku-san.

154
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,700
You can win, right?

155
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,140
Or rather, you'd better win.

156
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,980
I won't forgive you if you lose.

157
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,630
Yes...

158
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,800
A battle between master and butler.

159
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,530
This is getting interesting.

160
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,010
I'm the one who will win.

161
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,850
Hinagiku-san. Our shop is a butler cafe.

162
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,090
How are we going to this doujinshi sales showdown?

163
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Yes, you do have a point.

164
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,370
And so the battle between the two factions began.

165
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,140
Hayaku koi!

166
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,140
Hurry and come here!

167
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,370
Ready?

168
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,620
Chotto okotteruzo

169
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,620
I'm a little mad

170
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,760
Our heart is so cheerful!

171
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,340
Hayaku koi!

172
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,340
Hurry and come here!

173
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,150
Millennium Legend, Magical Destroy!

174
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,740
Mahha kousoku dazo?

175
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,740
Mach high speed, you here?

176
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,710
On sale now!

177
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,810
Hikikomori nichiyoubi.

178
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,810
Hikikomori Sunday.

179
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,580
Anyone who wishes to buy one, please form 3 lines.

180
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,330
Suguni toned konakucha

181
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,330
You have to come running to me

182
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:43,400
Dame~

183
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:43,400
Or else it's a no-no!

184
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,420
Have a taste of your impotence, Ayasaki Hayate.

185
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,440
Tonikaku dame dame.

186
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,440
It's a no-no.

187
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,740
And show me you crying and withering from a broken heart.

188
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,090
What? Is that the reason why you set this fight up?

189
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,590
Do your best and lose, Hayata-kun.

190
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,280
In fact, go and forfeit, Hayata-kun.

191
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,030
I want to see Hina-chan in an embarrassing maid outfit.

192
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,690
So you know, if he loses, you'll be wearing the same outfits.

193
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,650
What?

194
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,790
We can't let that happen.

195
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,160
Right?

196
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,650
So we all need to support Hayate-kun.

197
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,100
And you, too, Hayate-kun.

198
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,700
If you don't win this match, you can't win Nagi back.

199
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,640
You have to open her eyes.

200
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,300
Do you hear?

201
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,670
Yes.

202
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,650
Hinagiku-san is right.

203
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:46,170
I must regain Milady's smile, no matter what.

204
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,820
Yorumo appare

205
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,820
Yorumo appare = Fun at night.

206
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,200
Renzoku Konbo

207
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,200
Renzoku Konbo = Combo Chain

208
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,870
We win.

209
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,790
I can already see him crying.

210
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,100
W-We have a problem!

211
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,480
Their sales are shooting up all of a sudden!

212
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,180
What?

213
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:24,240
It's that time of year. Suginami ward's famous attraction, the Hakuou Academy Culture Festival.

214
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,550
And this year, this shop's cake set is very popular.

215
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,760
Let's go take a look in the kitchen.

216
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,570
Excuse me. May we interview you?

217
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:35,830
Yes.

218
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,410
What's the secret behind the taste?

219
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:42,630
I'm just making it with all my heart.

220
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:46,790
And right now, you get this doujinshi
that lists the cake's recipe with the set.

221
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,460
PLACEHOLDER

222
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,480
Wow, that's a great deal you're getting from this.

223
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,730
Wh-What is this?

224
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,830
And the cover is specially drawn by Shiraishi-sensei.

225
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:53,530
Well, Hayate-kun's ability as a cook is at a professional level.

226
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,220
PLACEHOLDER

227
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,220
I'd like to have one, too.

228
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,140
But, why is Hayate-kun making cake?

229
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,400
It's 500 yen a set.

230
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,790
That's so cheap.

231
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,380
Can we have a cake set, Ms. Butler.

232
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,540
Me, too.

233
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,050
Yes, right away, Miladies.

234
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,640
Can we have a cake set here, too?

235
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,340
Yes, right away.

236
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,550
Can we have one here, too?

237
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,680
Hey, are you listening, Mr. Butler?

238
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,600
Sir?

239
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,940
Ah, how about a seconds for your tea, Milady?

240
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,060
Ohh, you're calling me Milady?

241
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,620
PLACEHOLDER

242
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:31,350
You don't seem to be focused, Sir.

243
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,980
I'm surprised those two came to help.

244
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,290
On the other hand,

245
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,370
I wonder what Milady is doing now.

246
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,340
I-I'm sorry, Nonohara.

247
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,430
Hey, Hayata-kun. You can't stop your hands.

248
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,670
I'm sorry!

249
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,310
If you don't work hard, we are the ones
who have to face the terrible consequences.

250
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,940
We would have interfered with you if it was only Hina.

251
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,600
How about we have her wear a maid outfit for us as a celebration if we win?

252
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,960
Nice idea.

253
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,130
I will not!

254
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,470
End of break for you, too, Hayate-kun.

255
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,420
We need more cake.

256
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,450
Yes.

257
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,390
I'd now like to try the cake.

258
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,550
Cake?

259
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,990
No, I mustn't.

260
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,160
They're thinking.

261
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,990
But there's nothing to fear!
We will continue to increase the lead!

262
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,220
Y-Yes!

263
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,340
If they're going to add cake, then we have an idea, too.

264
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:20,840
Shion!

265
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,370
Y-Yes!

266
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,100
There... we... go.

267
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,720
Sorry for the wait.

268
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,950
Anyone who buys Sanzenin Nagi's doujinshi will get a expensive prize!

269
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,620
Even those who have already bought one!
How about buying another one?

270
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,760
Hayate...

271
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,730
Dokokade boku wo yondeiru

272
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,730
Someone's calling me from somewhere.

273
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,210
Near the end of the day, the battle heats up.

274
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:55,300
Yuuki yo kaze yo maki okore

275
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:55,300
Courage and wind, start blowing around me.

276
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,510
And...

277
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,810
Dokokade boku wo yondeiru

278
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,810
Someone's calling me from somewhere.

279
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,830
I wonder what Hayate-kun's doing now.

280
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:05,530
Kizudarake datte kamawanai

281
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:05,530
I don't care if I'm covered in wounds.

282
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:10,760
Dokokade boku wo yondeiru

283
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:10,760
Someone's calling me from somewhere.

284
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:14,010
Get the car! Get the car! Get the car!

285
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:16,660
Hora saikyou no hero ni naru

286
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:16,660
See, I'll become the strongest hero.

287
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,530
Oh, how close!

288
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,210
He gets the expensive home theater set as a consolation prize!

289
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,600
Imasugu ikukara! Datte boku ha kimi dake no mono!

290
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,600
I'll be there right away. Because I belong only to you.

291
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,350
All right!

292
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,710
I'm sorry for you.

293
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,730
Here's your prize and doujinshi.

294
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,640
Thank you very much!

295
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,550
With that, we've sold everything!

296
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:37,610
I'm amazed that we sold this manga that doesn't make any sense.

297
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,090
Everyone just wanted the prize.

298
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,350
Yeah, that had to be it.

299
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:51,790
He's not here.

300
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,850
Is the reason why you're acting so stubborn that the hypnosis only partially wore off?

301
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,700
If so, it's easy to turn back.

302
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,950
You're smarter than me, aren't you?

303
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,910
I see. I get it.

304
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,640
Thank you, Haruko.

305
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,760
Hina.

306
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:28,100
Ah, looks like we're still down by a little.

307
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,300
But they ran out of ammo, so we might be able to catch up.

308
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,040
But there aren't any customers left.

309
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,010
We only have a little to go, so let's work hard to the end!

310
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,750
Yes! Exactly as Katsura-san says!

311
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,250
If we lose, you get to see Hina in an embarrassing maid outfit.

312
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,590
Let's... not give up... and win!

313
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,450
He won.

314
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,490
He won against something inside his heart.

315
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,760
Okay, then let's do this!

316
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,280
Yeah!

317
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,350
Then let's go search for customers.

318
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,580
Yeah, let's go.

319
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,280
What's wrong, Hayate-kun?

320
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,650
I was just thinking that working hard
with everyone on one thing is very fun.

321
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,150
Your face doesn't really say that.

322
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:15,870
That's not it...

323
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:20,620
I wanted Milady to experience this feeling, too.

324
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:30,060
Then let's have her experience it now.

325
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,980
Milady.

326
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,940
Welcome.

327
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,100
You're here to have some cake, right?

328
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,030
Since I know I'm the winner.

329
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,940
So I'm only here to see your beaten faces!

330
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,670
That's too bad.

331
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:52,250
We still have cake left over, so I wanted you to try some.

332
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,520
Right, Hayate-kun?

333
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,850
W-Well, if you insist so much.

334
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,800
I did use my head a lot from drawing the manga,

335
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,000
and I need the sugar from something sweet to replenish my tired brain.

336
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,630
So...

337
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,600
I want to try the cake Hayate made.

338
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,210
Certainly!

339
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,960
Sorry for the wait.

340
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,180
This is!

341
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,540
It's our specialty.

342
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:31,690
It is a little out of season,
but I made it wholeheartedly for someone.

343
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,780
That person said "I don't care" to me.

344
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:46,140
So... So I wanted that person to remember all the time we spent together.

345
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,580
It's sweet.

346
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,260
Hayate?

347
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,250
Milady!

348
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,760
Where am I?

349
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:21,070
I remember coming to meet you and talking to a strange fortune teller.

350
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,680
Milady!

351
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,360
What's wrong, Hayate?

352
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,620
If someone sees us...

353
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,070
We're totally being watched!

354
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,380
Your hypnosis must be all gone now!

355
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,660
So what?!

356
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,990
Look at the clock!

357
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,880
The time will run out soon.

358
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,330
However the difference in sales is obvious.

359
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,670
Now, my friends in the student council.

360
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:54,520
I'd like you to serve me
in these embarrassing maid outfits I designed.

361
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,350
Hello?

362
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:06,250
Nagi? I thought you must be out of your hypnotic state and with Hayate-kun by now.

363
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:11,310
You're right. So what? Things look pretty serious right now.

364
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:16,130
Oh, I'm sorry. But I wanted to have Hayate-kun's cake, too.

365
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,870
Will you buy some, including for all of the SPs, too?

366
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,530
I guess for 2000 people.

367
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,270
Okay.

368
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:27,010
Maria said to buy enough cake for 2000 people.

369
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,040
Thank you very much.

370
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,380
To go, right?

371
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,950
I-It looks like we won.

372
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:45,520
And so the risky doujinshi battle ends.

373
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:51,280
Still, I wonder why Nagi's hypnosis wore off.

374
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,730
I wonder why, too.

375
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,020
It's so half-assed, don't you think?

376
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,840
Hurry up, Hayate!

377
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,320
If you don't, the closing ceremony party will end!

378
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,310
What? Please wait. This is embarrassing, Milady.

379
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,640
Hayate-kun? What's with the outfit?

380
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,090
It's his punishment for leaving me alone.

381
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,760
Doesn't he look great?

382
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,200
Sounds like the folk dance has started.

383
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,490
Let's go, Hayate!

384
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,130
Eh?

385
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,950
I can't go out in these clothes!

386
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,700
Hey, Hayate!

387
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,510
Oh boy. Looks like Hayate-kun's busy life doesn't change.

388
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,130
It must be hard to deal with a stubborn person.

389
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,670
Wh-What's with those looks?

390
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,940
No, nothing really.

391
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,640
If you have something to say, say it clearly.

392
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,020
Cross-dressing...

393
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,550
Ayasaki Hayate...

394
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,830
I want him.

395
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:45,270
Gosh, Kuzuha-sama.

396
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:50,400
And so, Hayate is once again targeted by the Superintendent.

397
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,150
Next week, we'll fight against the city for modern teenagers.

398
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,960
Nagi and,

399
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,620
Hayate and,

400
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,880
Nishizawa Ayumu's

401
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,700
Butler Network!

402
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,970
Twinkle twinkle little star! I'm Sanzenin Nagi.

403
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,120
I'm Ayasaki Hayate.

404
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,460
I'm Nishizawa Ayumu.

405
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,850
Wait! You're still here?!

406
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,700
The guests should be rotating every three weeks.

407
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,090
What? Give me a little slack, will you?

408
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,440
Besides, I still haven't heard what Hayate-kun thinks about my song.

409
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,270
So, what do you think of my song, Hayate-kun?

410
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:53,160
You scored 35 points the last time you sang, but this one deserves 100.

411
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,780
Besides, nowadays, everything can be fixed thanks to science.

412
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,750
You spilled the beans!

413
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,640
Next week will be Wataru-kun and Saki-san.

414
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,820
Bye bye!

415
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:04,690
Why? Why is it that such a prodigy as myself can't draw anymore?

416
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,190
What's wrong, Milady?

417
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,230
Nagi is working on drawing a new manga.

418
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:13,130
Therefore, Hayate, go and find me references for date spots that teenagers like to go to nowadays.

419
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,230
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

420
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:18,740
Must see! 2007 Autumn Complete Guide Book for the Latest Trendy Date Spots for Teenagers

421
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,070
Therefore, I will be going out with you today, Hayate-kun.

422
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,510
Going out?!

423
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:27,490
Did you know? A fossil of elephas namadicus was once found at Harajyuku.
