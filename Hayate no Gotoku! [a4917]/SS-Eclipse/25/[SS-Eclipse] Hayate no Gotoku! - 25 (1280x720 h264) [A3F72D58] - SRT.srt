1
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,410
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,020
Got it?

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,340
Hayate-sama, are you all right?

4
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,980
Of course I'm fine!

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,970
Counting the number of threads
in a tatami mat is child's play to me.

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,780
Wow, you're amazing.

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,010
One, two, three, four, five...

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,500
He's really broken down.

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,010
Yeah.

10
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,300
One hundred twenty three thousand, six hundred...

11
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,200
One hundred twenty three thousand, six hundred one...

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,350
One hundred twenty three thousand, six hundred two...

13
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,000
Hayate-sama?

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,080
Yes?

15
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,030
I'm at one hundred twenty three thousand, six hundred two right now.

16
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,590
One hundred twenty three thousand, six hundred three...

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,670
He's gone.

18
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,460
One hundred twenty three thousand, six hundred four...

19
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,460
Yeah, he is.

20
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,750
One hundred twenty three thousand, six hundred five...

21
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,890
It's natural for me to be discarded by Milady.

22
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:54,900
Um...

23
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,640
It was like a dream to be able to work at a mansion like that to begin with.

24
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,810
Um!

25
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,000
I only woke up from a dream.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,620
There's nothing to be sad about.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,620
Um, Hayate-sama?

28
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:05,980
Push.

29
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,420
I-Isumi-san?

30
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,950
I'm sorry!

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,470
You did not look very cheerful, so...

32
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,670
...I tried to cheer you up.

33
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,390
I am sorry for doing something I am not used to doing,

34
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,040
but I did not know what to do.

35
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,570
You mustn't laugh.

36
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,080
No, thanks to you, I feel better!

37
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,990
So I'm fine now!

38
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,510
That's right; all I can do is do my best here.

39
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,930
Therefore I'll do my best and count the number of threads in the tatami in the entire house!

40
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,850
You're amazing!

41
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,400
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

42
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,400
His head is broken.

43
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,050
Could be a terminal condition.

44
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,050
Eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen...

45
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,560
A butler is one who serves.

46
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,060
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

47
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:01,970
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

48
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:03,960
Yes.

49
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:12,010
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

50
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,010
Hey! Can you tell who I am?

51
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,140
Yes, it's Gilbert!

52
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,650
Hayate no Gotoku is starting, yo!

53
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,850
Really, what were you thinking,
selling Hayate-kun to the Saginomiyas.

54
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,160
It just turned out like that, so don't blame me.

55
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,160
Do you intend to lose important things one by one like that?

56
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,760
Shut up! Besides, why are you here?

57
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,560
The SPs told me you were here.

58
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,320
Aren't you guys on my side?!

59
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,990
Of course we are!

60
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,260
Oh, you are?

61
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,550
I see.

62
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,780
Nagi's side, huh?

63
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,050
You traitors!

64
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,360
Tyrannical selfishness will not make people follow you.

65
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,300
Maria-san's amazing.

66
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,340
She can handle those big men so easily.

67
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,940
She's different from an aging maid.

68
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,030
Who are you calling an aging maid?

69
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,030
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

70
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,490
Well, I hope he is not crying.

71
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:55,090
If you sold him for ¥150,000,000, then what you did is no different from what his parents did to him.

72
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,410
Yes, Hayate-san seems to be a very delicate person.

73
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,730
He smiles on the face but cries in his heart.

74
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:09,020
Besides, if he always gets yelled at by a tomboy like Nagi,
I can understand why he'd want to cry.

75
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:14,650
C-Could I possibly have done something terrible to Hayate?

76
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,900
Needless to say, everyone thought, "You just noticed that now?"

77
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,830
I'm... I'm...

78
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,220
Nagi?

79
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,160
W-Why are you crying?

80
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,180
I'm not crying!

81
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,110
Hayate might not like me anymore.

82
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,020
D-Don't worry! Sir will do something about it, Lady!

83
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,970
Me?!

84
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,760
Remember I'm also depressed over Isumi?!

85
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,230
Don't worry! Your power of love will certainly make Isumi-san look in your direction!

86
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,810
You think so?

87
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,420
But Wataru's not that popular.

88
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,130
Lady Nagi!

89
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,130
Are you picking a fight with me?!

90
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,160
Well, whatever. I'll work things out, so wait here!

91
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,100
Sir?

92
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,740
But how are we going to bring him back?

93
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,230
Oh, that's easy.

94
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,840
Hayate-kun must be thinking Nagi hates him now,

95
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,640
so all we have to do is tell him
Nagi is crying and wants him to come back.

96
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,120
But what about Isumi?

97
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,430
From my hunch, I do not think she is that attached to him.

98
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:27,110
Things'll be fine if you leave it to them.

99
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,720
But Hayate must hate me now.

100
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,240
Then why not test him?

101
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,440
Who are you?

102
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,140
And test what?

103
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,990
I said, test the love.

104
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,890
Excuse me, Lady. Is he someone you know?

105
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,350
Yes, embarrassingly enough, he's a relative.

106
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,940
Not just a relative.

107
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,430
A candidate for heir to the Sanzenin estate!

108
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,590
Gilbert!

109
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,770
Um, is he really your relative?

110
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,030
I'd like him not to be.

111
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,630
So, what's this "test the love"?

112
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:07,110
What I mean is, if love still exists
between you and him, he shall overcome any obstacles.

113
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:13,600
For example, say that I kidnapped you; he may or may not come for you!

114
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Fake a kidnapping?!

115
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,680
You can't do that!

116
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,780
Yeah, I don't think so.

117
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,260
Why?

118
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,850
Hayate probably won't come.

119
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,950
Well, he might,

120
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,580
but I feel that it would be out of pity for me.

121
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,300
I see. What a chicken.

122
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:34,410
For a wuss who won't even take a risk
to be the future president of the Sanzenin...

123
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,270
This world really is corrupt.

124
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,270
You got it, then!

125
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,160
Do whatever you want, a fake kidnapping or whatever!

126
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,720
Lady!

127
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,100
But I'll be the one to win this!

128
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,910
That's the way I want it.

129
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,950
Meanwhile, at the Saginomiya residence...

130
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,680
Are you confortable with the situation, Hayate-kun?

131
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,380
Fine or not, I don't have a choice.

132
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:00,510
There will be no end if you take every whimsical thing she says seriously.

133
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,560
Well, yes, but...

134
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,560
They're bashing her...

135
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,390
Moreover, don't you want to come back?

136
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,900
Did you not leave things behind
with Nagi and the Sanzenin mansion?

137
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,970
Leave behind? Memories...

138
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,050
Tokyo's underground is amazing as always!

139
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,970
But why come all the way here?

140
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,760
To test the love, the hurdle has to be proportionally large.

141
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,240
Are you planning to fight Hayate again?

142
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,990
Yes.

143
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:40,530
No matter how strong that butler may be,
it's impossible for him to beat this!

144
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,470
What do you plan to do if Hayate gets hurt?

145
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,880
No worries.

146
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,640
The scientist who made this is a genius.

147
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,210
It's made to be human friendly.

148
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,300
Say, Eight...

149
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,490
Do you remember what this was for?

150
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:04,780
That'd be the control regulation chip for the giant robot you made yesterday at the request of your friend.

151
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,050
I made a giant robot?

152
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,500
I was half-asleep, so I don't remember well.

153
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:19,060
That proves how amazing you are, to create that while half-asleep.

154
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,790
You think so?

155
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,510
But it really wasn't that big of a job.

156
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:26,940
I only used your prototype body and installed your OS 8.1.

157
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,480
Th-That'd be data from when I was most hurt emotionally.

158
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,520
Isn't it very dangerous?

159
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,560
Oh come on, Eight.

160
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,320
That's why I made the control regulation chip.

161
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,960
I-I see...

162
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,040
It's so boring.

163
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,180
I wonder if anything good will happen.

164
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,160
You're joking! This is still fresh off the pan!

165
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,910
It's got to be a present from God!

166
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,890
Sushi, suki ka?

167
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,890
Sushi, suki ka? = Do you like sushi?

168
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,890
Kaikoku shitekudasai

169
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,890
Kaikoku shitekudasai = "Please open the port"
from Matthew Calbraith Perry, who arrived at Japan in 1853

170
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,110
Will Hayate come?

171
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,500
Even if he did, Hayate would now be...

172
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,810
Isumi-san's house is so comfortable.

173
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,250
You're so kind and calm unlike that selfish girl.

174
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,380
It was right to be sold here.

175
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:36,330
Hey, hey. That's only your imagination.

176
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:40,240
Y-Yeah, it's all Hayate's fault for cheating on me!

177
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,850
Who cheated on whom?

178
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,660
Sakuya!

179
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,380
Why are you here?

180
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,610
Why? Because I have to watch what my Aniki's doing.

181
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,420
What?

182
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,870
G-Gilbert's is your older brother?

183
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,960
I didn't know until recently myself,

184
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,230
but apparently we have different mothers, and his existence was kept hidden.

185
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,840
But we look alike, don't we?

186
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,870
Is that something to be happy about?

187
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,970
But, how did this happen?

188
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,700
Well... Hayate was cheating on me with Isumi...

189
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,250
Huh?

190
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,120
Not only with Isumi!

191
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,620
Hayate said that he has fun with you, too.

192
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,380
Yeah, we do have lots of fun.

193
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,920
From smacking each other after each gag.

194
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,140
Like I said, over gags.

195
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,080
Ah-ha.

196
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,700
What's this, Nagi-chan?

197
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,070
You're only thirteen, and you took fun as "fun"?

198
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,630
No, absolutely not!

199
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,100
I knew it was over gags. I wasn't misunderstanding him at all!

200
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,430
Don't sweat it. I know. I know.

201
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,080
You're dirty-minded.

202
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,580
But what a horrible story.

203
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:47,450
That debt-ridden butler had done nothing wrong to be accused of and yet got sold off.

204
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,920
He definitely won't come.

205
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,390
Hayate would never come save me.

206
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:01,930
Little girl, people's trust becomes stronger as you overcome such misunderstandings.

207
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,350
Therefore you must not fear misunderstandings.

208
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,320
It's the proof of love to come nonetheless!

209
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,740
Wh-What? The machine's moving on its own.

210
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,570
Aniki?

211
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,970
Kill.

212
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,280
Kill.

213
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,650
Will kill the blond twin-tail and her butler.

214
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,880
My life was ruined thanks to them!

215
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,200
So he says. What should we do?

216
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,750
Well, I don't want to hear a guy bitch about not being popular with girls.

217
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,370
Yeah, why not forget about him and get out of here?

218
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,750
Let's just tell Aniki riding inside, "You are dead."

219
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,800
Don't forsake me, my sister!

220
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,940
Besides, this thing is after Lady Nagi.

221
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,140
I don't think you can get away that easily.

222
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,600
That's right. I will not forgive that blond twin-tail.

223
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,080
Where is she?

224
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,080
Where did she go?

225
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,550
Yup, it's better not to skimp on the CPU.

226
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,560
But I'm glad this didn't turn into a big mess.

227
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,750
Where are you, blond twin-tail?

228
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,450
They could be worried about us, so let's give a call to Sir.

229
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,430
Sounds good.

230
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:05,750
What's wrong, Saki?

231
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,280
Hey, don't tell me Nagi got kidnapped.

232
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,440
No, not a kidnapping, it's-

233
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,160
Curse you, Sanzenin Nagi. I will kill you.

234
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,910
What?! Don't tell me it's a homicide!

235
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,040
No, absolutely not!

236
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,970
Then is it about to turn into a homicide?

237
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,520
Don't worry, she hasn't been killed yet.

238
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,390
Then is Nagi about to be killed?

239
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,120
Hey Saki! Saki!

240
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,310
Um, Wataru-kun. What was that phone call about?

241
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:41,130
Not entirely sure, but sounds like Saki screwed something up
and Nagi's kidnapped and about to get killed.

242
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,180
Wh-What? Nagi is?

243
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,480
Hayate-kun!

244
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,510
Huh? Hayate-kun?

245
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,750
Ah, man.

246
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,170
Fine, I'll give them another call.

247
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,910
I think they completely misunderstood what happened.

248
00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:01,320
Oh, if I kill all three of them, then one of them has got to be her.

249
00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:01,320
Hey it's Saku. Just wanted to say...

250
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,790
...we're in real deep trouble, so come save us.

251
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:05,880
Hey!

252
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,160
Sounds like they really are in big trouble.

253
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,600
It will be all right.

254
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,810
Hayate-sama has already gone to save Nagi.

255
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,900
Ladies!

256
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,220
That! That's attacking us!

257
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,520
What?

258
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,710
To attack our precious Lady Nagi.

259
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,010
I won't forgive you even if you are part of the Sanzenin family!

260
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:33,660
Shut up! If you don't want to experience any pain,
hand over the twin-tailed girl.

261
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,410
Don't underestimate the Sanzenin's SPs' power.

262
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,060
What?

263
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,790
Look, you piece of metal from Devil **der!

264
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,000
This is the quality of the Sanzenin SP!

265
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,000
I found you, twin-tail!

266
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,460
It's all solved now.

267
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,390
Of course it isn't!

268
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,380
Seriously! This is too horrible!

269
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,030
I've cornered you now, girl.

270
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,500
No, no, no. What do you intend to do after cornering me?

271
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:05,880
What?

272
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,350
Do what?

273
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:13,770
*Blush*

274
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,390
Then how about...

275
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,720
What was the blushing about?

276
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,660
And I really don't like how your fingers are moving.

277
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,860
Shut up, girl!

278
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,010
Get out of the way, you idiot!

279
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,390
Sir!

280
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,750
Really, don't make me go through that.

281
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,270
Why are you here?

282
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,880
This place turns out to be right under Isumi's house.

283
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,360
Wh-What?

284
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,360
Sir!

285
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,480
Stop, you fool!

286
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,300
I always thought you were a child,
but you've become a great man without me noticing.

287
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,810
Become... a man...

288
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,740
Will he watch those?

289
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,810
You can't!

290
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:53,520
Huh?

291
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,850
You're too young for adult videos.

292
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,960
I-I don't watch that stuff!

293
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,410
Hey, you two! You better get out of there!

294
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,150
I won't miss this time.

295
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,910
That's enough, rundown robot!

296
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,550
Did you not hear me, you rundown!

297
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,880
You trashy crab!

298
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,640
W-Why you...

299
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,430
You're inferior to fake ******* in design, and you dare to trouble people?

300
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,990
That's why you're not popular with girls!

301
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:23,630
I, Sanzenin Nagi, shall be your opponent.

302
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:27,170
Then eat this!

303
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,400
Watch out, Milady!

304
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,900
Where's Hayate?!

305
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,240
He left for here before I did.

306
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,440
Oh, I get it.

307
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,140
Hayate won't be coming.

308
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,650
Lady Nagi!

309
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,790
He won't come.

310
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,820
He hates me now.

311
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,590
Nagi, run!

312
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,950
Die!

313
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:51,720
Hayate...

314
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,730
Hayate!!!

315
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,950
Did you call for me, Milady?

316
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,870
Hayate, why are you here?

317
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,580
Why?

318
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,920
Because you called for me.

319
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:31,500
I have not forgotten the pain you've caused me.

320
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,660
Is there anywhere that hurts, Milady?

321
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,430
I will now return all that back to you.

322
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,430
No, I'm fine.

323
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,760
I see. That's good to hear.

324
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,760
Hey, stop ignoring me!

325
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,110
You don't need to rush; I will have you
take responsibility for endangering Milady.

326
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,350
Could he possibly be angry?

327
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,600
And when those who usually don't get angry get angry...

328
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,280
He's scary.

329
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,250
Hey boy, please don't forget me.

330
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,570
Gilbert is on board this mecha.

331
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:03,530
I see. So you're the one that was trying to kidnap Milady.

332
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,420
Y-You got that a little wrong.

333
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,500
I was playing along with everyone and...

334
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,160
Playing along?

335
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,730
Then you're saying that Saki-san came up
with the stupid idea of faking a kidnapping?

336
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,100
Well, Saki-san?

337
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,320
No, Gilbert Aniki kidnapped her for the sake of the estate.

338
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,780
Hear that?

339
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,780
My sister...

340
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,250
Looks like money is the only thing you can trust.

341
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:33,090
Then I will fulfill the requirement and get the Sanzenin estate!

342
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,060
Hell Volcanic Destroy!!!

343
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,230
No you don't.

344
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,030
I won't put Milady in any more danger.

345
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,660
Hayate!

346
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,860
Pass this on to the other candidates, as well.

347
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:52,330
Anyone who wants the Sanzenin's estate will have to defeat her butler, Ayasaki Hayate, first!

348
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,750
What? Do you understand the danger that comes with that?

349
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,900
I do.

350
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,350
Besides, that Old Mikado wouldn't accept that.

351
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:07,210
She might hate you because of another misunderstanding and kick you out again.

352
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:10,460
It doesn't matter if Milady hates me.

353
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,960
My care for her will not change no matter what.

354
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,750
Quit the love-comedy!

355
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:28,440
No matter how cool you act,
you can't beat this robot, Ayasaki Hayate!

356
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,930
You'll be the one dying!

357
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,350
Watch out, Hayate!

358
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,290
You don't have to worry about a thing.

359
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:39,120
I've come prepared with various things in case of situations like this.

360
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,990
What?

361
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,210
That's violating the Sword and Firearm Control Law!

362
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,270
Don't worry; I'm aware of how to use this.

363
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,660
From where?

364
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:58,280
Besides, if it's to protect Milady, I really don't care about the Sword and Firearm Control Law.

365
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,180
Do you want to continue?

366
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,700
Even if you defeat me, the second and third Gilbert will...

367
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,800
What kind of evil lord do you think you are?

368
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,190
I give up! I give up!

369
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,810
The fierce gun battle ended.

370
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,210
Hayate...

371
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,450
Yes, Milady?

372
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,970
And the girl and butler gaze at each other.

373
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,150
Well, um...

374
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,570
"I'm sorry I fired you on an impulse."

375
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:35,830
"I apologize, so come back to the mansion with me."

376
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,680
...is what Nagi wants to say, but...

377
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:50,160
I just noticed that I changed the conditions to the inheriting the estate, so staying by you would be more dangerous.

378
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:56,170
And first of all, I am Isumi-san's butler now, aren't I?

379
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,540
Well, ah...

380
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:04,010
But, since I ran out, skipping out on work, I could be fired from the position by now.

381
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:10,870
If so, I'd be lost in the street again
with a debt of ¥150,000,000 on me.

382
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,190
I wonder if there's a cute girl who would find me a new job.

383
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,400
Th-Then...

384
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,660
...would you like to be my butler?

385
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,890
Yes, Milady!

386
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,910
Are you okay with this, Isumi-san?

387
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:41,730
It's not good to buy and sell people with money.

388
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,450
Plus...

389
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,580
Plus?

390
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,520
Those two go well together.

391
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:31,160
Nagi and...

392
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,330
Hayate's..

393
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,990
Butler Network!

394
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,330
I've got a great idea.

395
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,430
This is Sanzenin Nagi.

396
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,670
This is Ayasaki Hayate.

397
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,830
And this is Aizawa Sakuya.

398
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,830
Aizawa-san, this is a really refined song.

399
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,910
It's because my cri de coeur  is contained in it.

400
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,480
It's the song most loved by women living in the Osaka area.

401
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,970
It only sounds like an old-fashioned song to me.

402
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:54,340
I guess a kid like Nagi still can't understand the good parts of the song.

403
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,850
I don't mind not figuring it out for the rest of my life.

404
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,540
Next week will be a special.

405
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,250
Please look forward to it.

406
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,880
Bye bye.

407
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,360
Hey Hayate, what is this about?

408
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,510
Stop this foolish joke.

409
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,160
Um...

410
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,330
I'm not giving Hayate-kun to you.

411
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:12,910
He's... He's... My important butler!

412
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,200
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

413
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:21,110
It Took 29 Minutes To Deliver, So Please Pay the Amount We Had Originally Asked For... Is an Old Myth Now

414
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:24,350
Hayate's amnesia? You're joking!

415
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:27,210
Next week, you'll be excited over Hayate's crossdressing.
