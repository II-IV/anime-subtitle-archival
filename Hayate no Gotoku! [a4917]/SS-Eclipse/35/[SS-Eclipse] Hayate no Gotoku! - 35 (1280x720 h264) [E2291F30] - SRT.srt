1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,300
When watching TV,

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,810
make sure the room is well lit,

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,990
and watch from a distance.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,020
Got it?

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,360
Milady!

6
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,120
Milady!

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,040
Mi-la-dy!

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,230
She's nowhere to be found.

9
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,380
This is strange.

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,360
She's not even here.

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,340
Where did Milady go?

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,110
Senpai!

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,590
What's the matter, Milady?

14
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,200
Senpai. Please use this sports towel.

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,820
I'll be cheering for you during your game today!

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,210
Wh-What game?

17
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,130
This is so embarrassing!

18
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,690
Milady is broken!

19
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,170
Nagi is working on drawing a new manga.

20
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:53,900
Manga?

21
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,550
She's going to try a youth love story.

22
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,510
She's right. I thought my pen would move on its own if I acted the part, but...

23
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,150
No! I can't draw anything!

24
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,460
Are you all right, Milady?

25
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,140
I was able to do well until I was midway through, but...

26
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,140
"Well"?

27
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,300
Well, it is.

28
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,530
I can't get this important scene,
where the heroine of the story, Iglesias Nobue,

29
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,140
who loves Oosotogari Chadao, the captain of the prestigious Kabaddi club of St. Yamaimo Academy,

30
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,600
finally goes on a date with Chadao after many misunderstandings, to go anywhere, nowhere, and a bulldog goes "woof".

31
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,520
Is that really a youth love story?

32
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,830
It sounds very complicated.

33
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:43,720
Why? Why is it that such a prodigy as myself can't draw anymore?

34
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,720
You shouldn't get so worked up.

35
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,150
I know!

36
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,880
I can't draw because I don't have any references.

37
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,710
Huh?

38
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,250
That has to be it!

39
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,080
Therefore, Hayate!

40
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,550
Yes?

41
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,680
Go gather references for me at once!

42
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,690
References?

43
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,460
I want you to capture the trendy date spots teenagers nowadays like to go to!

44
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:05,380
What? But I don't have a clue about trendy date spots.

45
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,750
"Stop talking back! It's your master's crisis! Get going already."

46
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,100
Is that what you want to say?

47
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,000
Oh boy. I've never been on a date myself.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,380
What a rare teenager.

49
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,420
Leave me alone!

50
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,150
All right, I shall.

51
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,470
Where should I even go?

52
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,220
Would Harajuku be a standard date spot?

53
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,690
I said leave me alone!

54
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,390
Harajuku...

55
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,430
Eh?!

56
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:30,730
Eh?!

57
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,850
Eh?!

58
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,530
Um... Ah... Ah...

59
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,900
W-W-W-Wou-Would... Would you be...

60
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,430
Maria-san?!

61
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,150
Yes.

62
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,630
You were in your casual clothes,
so I couldn't tell it was you for a second.

63
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,030
Y-You got me wondering who the pretty dresser was.

64
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,780
I do wear this kind of clothes from time to time.

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,820
Oh, by the way, may I accompany you?

66
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,100
Eh?

67
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,420
Eh?

68
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,430
EH?!?!?!

69
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,560
One who masters being a butler becomes the master of the world.

70
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,330
The Butler War that shakes the planet has started!

71
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,900
A date with Maria-san?

72
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,070
I get it. This episode's punch line has to be that I'm dreaming.

73
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,210
That's right. That has to be it!

74
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,200
Oh, so Milady said she wants to be alone?

75
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,190
Yes, like this.

76
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,500
Going to a flashback?

77
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,760
Thank you for going through the trouble of filling me in.

78
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,700
It's... not... working...

79
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,790
I can't draw anything no matter what I do.

80
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:03,720
I get it!

81
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,640
I can't concentrate because there's a person!

82
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,430
Person?

83
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,210
Me?

84
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,370
Maria! I'll give you a day off today!

85
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,380
Relay that to Klaus, too! I want to be alone!

86
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,630
Okay...

87
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,230
Klaus-san! Nagi sai-

88
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:24,450
Various people work for the Sanzenin, but the mansion is empty.

89
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,950
It's because Nagi doesn't like having attendants.

90
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,960
That's how it went.

91
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,200
The last picture didn't make any sense.

92
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,840
So after demanding reference material, she started sending people away, heh?

93
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,880
It's as if she's a popular manga artist.

94
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,570
Even if she tells me to take a break, I don't have any immediate needs.

95
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,760
Therefore, I'll be going out with you today, Hayate-kun.

96
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,720
Going out?!

97
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,640
Go... Going...

98
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,690
Would I be in your way?

99
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,260
Nononononono. Well, um, you see...

100
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,860
For you and me to go out...

101
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,470
I thought I would go out with you
on your hunt for Nagi's references.

102
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,090
Oh, that's what you meant.

103
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,840
Of course.

104
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,630
Yes! Yes! I'm making great progress!

105
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,150
Milady!

106
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,620
Why the sudden break?!

107
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,740
An old man like me doesn't have anywhere to go.

108
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,600
Shut up!

109
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,860
It's just one day, so go waste your time at an arcade or internet cafe!

110
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,370
Don't cry, Klaus. Think of your age.

111
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,130
How unsightly.

112
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,930
Wow, so many couples.

113
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,330
Couples...

114
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,020
What's wrong, Hayate-kun?

115
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,980
No, I think I'm getting people sick because I got used to living in the mansion.

116
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,810
But, I must collect good references for Milady's sake!

117
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,840
Now, what else should I take pictures of?

118
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,450
We should go to Takeshita Street.

119
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,670
Takeshita Street?

120
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:56,060
Yes, if I'm correct, you'll see a House with ***** by the entrance.

121
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:59,920
And there are T***** Valentine House, ***zan, and Nori****.

122
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,160
Um, from how many years ago is that?

123
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,040
Oh, and that's the famous Ma-

124
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,420
NO! We can't say that even with bleeps!

125
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,010
But strange. They're all gone.

126
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,560
Yes, I think they disappeared quite a while ago.

127
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,480
As we've been saying several times,
Maria-san is a fresh seventeen year old.

128
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:24,420
I did bring the guidebook, so let's just walk around here.

129
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,080
Huh? Maria-san?

130
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:32,070
Maria-san, did you want to try on clothes?

131
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,440
No.

132
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,950
Oh please. I'm absolutely, negligibly, completely not thinking things like...

133
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:40,450
...I'm interested in the latest trends,
want to try current fashions, or love dressing up.

134
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,570
That so?

135
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,610
But, it looks like it'll be a good reference source for Milady, so let's go take a look around.

136
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,480
You're right. Can't avoid it if it's for her.

137
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,020
In that case, just a little.

138
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,940
Yes.

139
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,060
Hayate-kun, look at this! So many cute clothes!

140
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,980
This one-piece looks really nice.

141
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,960
Please take your time and enjoy.

142
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,590
Maria-san is a normal girl after all.

143
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,310
Um.

144
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,410
Yes?

145
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,690
Hayate-kun...

146
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,530
Can I... try it on?

147
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,700
Wow...

148
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,980
Nice.

149
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,450
Amazing!

150
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,950
Hey, you're in the way! Shoo!

151
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,140
They're all great. You look nice in everything.

152
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,370
Don't say that...

153
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:30,460
From now on, call me the Ebi-chan of the anime world.

154
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,390
You're being too full of yourself.

155
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,600
What's wrong with that?!

156
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,290
Nothing.

157
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,890
She looks good! She looks nice! She looks great!

158
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,620
Hey there, boyfriend.

159
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,860
B-B-Boyfriend?

160
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,640
You should try on some clothes, too.

161
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,500
I'll coordinate some good looking ones.

162
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,390
I meant it as a joke, but you guys look great.

163
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,890
Wonderful!

164
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,400
So good!

165
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,980
A nice couple!

166
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,720
It's a little embarrassing.

167
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,280
What should we do?

168
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,390
It's so good.

169
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,290
You can't miss this if you're at Harajuku.

170
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,810
But it's boring.

171
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,910
There's nothing else here that attracts me other than the crepes.

172
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:12,980
We came since Yukiji said there's a civilization that sells live bamboo shoots.

173
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,920
How strange.

174
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,380
She's thinking about Takenoko-zoku.

175
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,380
Takenoko = Bamboo shoot

176
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:21,310
And those of you who don't know what Takenoko-zoku is,
you should ask the adults around you or Maria-san.

177
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:21,310
Takenoko-zoku: 	Group of people who danced in streets of Harajuku to disco music in 1979 and 1980.

178
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,110
Oh well. Once we eat this, let's go back to school and take a nap.

179
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,650
What? We just got here!

180
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,240
And we've only been on screen for three scenes!

181
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,620
If only there was something exciting...

182
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,340
I found it!

183
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,990
I'm sorry. You even bought me clothes.

184
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,280
It's fine.

185
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,010
That newly formed looking couple is...

186
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,050
It's our best friend, Hayata-kun!

187
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,240
Who knew Hayata-kun had such a beautiful girlfriend?

188
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,170
No, that's Nagi-chan's maid.

189
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,520
Wow, I couldn't tell with her casual outfit.

190
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,110
So it's maid and butler love in Harajuku, eh?

191
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:01,110
All right then! Let us support their date!

192
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,770
It's part of a teacher's duty to teach students the correct way to date.

193
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,950
Work? You're just having fun.

194
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,910
But this is  interesting.

195
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:14,220
Hey, if the two get married,
do you think they'll let us make speeches?

196
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,010
Forget speeches! We'll be the guests of honor!

197
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,070
We'll take the lead in toasting!

198
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,060
We'll gulp down the Dom Pérignon.

199
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,090
Therefore, everyone go!

200
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,720
Aye, aye, yo!

201
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,140
The silence is getting awkward.

202
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,600
What should we talk about in these situations?

203
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,700
Th-The saleslady earlier said we were a couple, didn't she?

204
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,010
Yes, how strange of her to think that we're a couple.

205
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,870
As a matter of a fact...

206
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,490
Where's the need for us to feel so restless?

207
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,860
Um...

208
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,180
L-L-Let's take some pictures around here for Milady's sake.

209
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,330
Y-Y-Yes, you're right.

210
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,000
Want me to take the picture?

211
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,790
You think you're disguised just by wearing an afro?

212
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,230
It's afro people, destroying the Harajuku atmosphere.

213
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,710
Excuse me, who are you?

214
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,260
As you can see, I'm a genius photographer!

215
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,650
And her assistants!

216
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,880
The tension they're speaking with doesn't make me feel like it's our first time meeting.

217
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,020
Maybe someone you know from a past life?

218
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:21,590
Their hearts are throbbing so much,
they can't see through such simple disguises.

219
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,630
Afros are fearesome, indeed.

220
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,980
My blood as a photographer is boiling!

221
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,300
Please let me use you two as my models.

222
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:27,870
No, thank you.

223
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,100
Okay, let's publish a photo collection.

224
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,020
The title will be Love Diary 2007!

225
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,980
Decided!

226
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,740
Decided!

227
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,690
Thank you very much.

228
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:35,740
Then will you-

229
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,460
What are you accepting?

230
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,650
But they're saying they would.

231
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,660
Absolutely not.

232
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,070
They're suspicious no matter how you look at them.

233
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,420
They're too suspicious.

234
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,990
You're too vulnerable.

235
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,030
Nice.

236
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,520
They talk you into taking more and more pictures. It's dangerous.

237
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,560
Nice!

238
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,970
Great!

239
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,590
These people pretend to take normal pictures and gradually move on to wilder pictures.

240
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,550
Get them closer!

241
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,890
Now the kiss!

242
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,320
STOP IT!

243
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,970
That's enough from Harajuku. Let's go somewhere else.

244
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,230
Ah, yes.

245
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,160
Why are they going away?

246
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,180
Didn't they seem bothered?

247
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,390
They're just embarrassed.

248
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,580
So cute!

249
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,740
And so they moved on to the next date spot.

250
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,850
Meanwhile...

251
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,480
Milday's pen was still not moving.

252
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,700
Hey, Hayate!

253
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,370
Maria! Tea!

254
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,830
Oh, right. I'm alone in this mansion right now.

255
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:27,610
Oh well. A little walk should refresh me.

256
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,260
Th-This is Hayate's room, isn't it?

257
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,090
And... the door is... left open.

258
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,840
No, I mustn't!

259
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,100
I can't enter someone else's room without permission!

260
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,340
Everyone has their privacy!

261
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,170
Yes. I won.

262
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,630
Is this a prank played by fate?

263
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,300
Or a result of passion?

264
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,460
The pen is...

265
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,480
In this situation, would I...

266
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,860
Boya boya shiteruto oitecchai masuyo.

267
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,860
Boya boya shiteruto oitecchai masuyo = I'll leave you behind if you lazzle dazzle.

268
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,760
Yorokonde tsuite mairimasu. Ha-to

269
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,760
Yorokonde tsuite mairimasu = I'll gladly follow you *heart*

270
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,260
I-It's because I don't have a choice.

271
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,450
About what?

272
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,820
It's because I have to pick up the pen I dropped.

273
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,040
So you did go in.

274
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,450
It's out of my control.

275
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,310
To whom are you making excuses?

276
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,530
Besides, it's Hayate's fault, too.

277
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,580
He should lock his door when he leaves.

278
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,030
I-It's his desk!

279
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:32,640
So, this is where Hayate always sits and studies.

280
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,680
Wh-What am I doing?!

281
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,590
Why am I making such a commotion over entering a boy's room?

282
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:46,610
B-But I'm not feeling well, so I'm going to take a little nap.

283
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,080
Only because I'm not feeling well!

284
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,150
You don't need to make excuses anymore.

285
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,350
What am I trying to do?!

286
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,790
Shoot, I'm starting to get dizzy.

287
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,050
I'll get out of here and continue with drawing my manga.

288
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,230
Where's my pen...

289
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,240
Wait, this is!

290
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,720
Could it be one of those books filled with naked females? Something all teenage boys are said to secretly own?

291
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,820
Hayate owned such a thing behind my back?

292
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,040
No, Hayate wouldn't!

293
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,730
But as his master and girlfriend, I must...

294
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,290
Attractive Bro?

295
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,480
He swings that way?!

296
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,660
She couldn't accept it.

297
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,530
The Lady found my secret fun reading.

298
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,030
So it was you who swings that way!

299
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,810
Oh, are we at Asakusa?

300
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,360
Yes. It's only thirty minutes away by subway.

301
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,470
I'm half lucky.

302
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,610
How about you?

303
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,400
Please don't ask.

304
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,090
Ah, it's hot.

305
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,670
Calm down and eat.

306
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,370
Hayate-kun!

307
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,090
Look at this!

308
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,220
Which one?

309
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,160
It's so cute.

310
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,520
I enjoyed it casually without thinking.

311
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,390
What was I thinking, grabbing on to Hayate-kun's sleeve.

312
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,270
Anyone want a ride?

313
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,350
It'll be cheap.

314
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,740
A rickshaw?

315
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,980
All the trendy date spots.

316
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,250
We'll show you everything.

317
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,440
Looks like it's perfect for the manga references.

318
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,100
You're right, then...

319
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,090
Give us a ride.

320
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,290
At your service.

321
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,770
Here we go!

322
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,970
We'll really get this going!

323
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,110
It's fast.

324
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,310
An amazing amount of G-force, too.

325
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:51,810
Off we go to the date course that will develop the two's love!

326
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,610
John-kun, living at the Tanakas at Higashi Koiwa, Edogawa-ku, is good at math problems.

327
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,400
This is a date spot?

328
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,180
And he got it wrong, too.

329
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,900
Next, Museum of Parasites.

330
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,390
What do you want us to do after coming here for a date?

331
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,450
This is a little...

332
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,820
Please live happily ever after like parasites.

333
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,940
This is a famous haunted area.

334
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,560
If you're lucky, you might get to see a woman hanging down from the ceiling.

335
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,940
Don't bring us to such a scary place.

336
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,420
Maybe this would work if it were summer.

337
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,780
Last stop is here.

338
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,550
It's a company that makes lots of fun anime.

339
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,990
The person acting Tsukishima ****o-chan came, too.

340
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,680
This is the end of the trip?

341
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,670
Please make sure to eat and sleep enough.

342
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,110
How was it? Did you enjoy the romantic moments?

343
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,910
We're back where we started.

344
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,970
But it was a rare experience.

345
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,420
Well, if you say so.

346
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,820
She took my digital camera!

347
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,160
Come on! Just hurry up and kiss already!

348
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:54,330
You're that phony photographer!

349
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,560
You're too persistent!

350
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,570
The Sumida is my ocean.

351
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,570
The ship's leaving!

352
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,930
We're getting on! We're getting on!

353
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,210
It's done!

354
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,610
It's pretty good.

355
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,780
Good thing I came to sweets class.

356
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,580
How wonderful!

357
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,330
It's nothing much.

358
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,390
It's about love.

359
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,760
Grazie to the how spectacular it is!

360
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:23,520
I've never seen a student make anything this amazing!

361
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,660
Thank you very much.

362
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,570
Grazie.

363
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:28,630
I lost...

364
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,890
Looks like we got away from that.

365
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:34,720
Yes.

366
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,570
Wait!

367
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:42,150
We're pumping up the date for you, so at least get a kiss in! A kiss!

368
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,800
Th-They're still coming after us.

369
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,630
What bothersome people.

370
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:53,380
At this rate, they're likely to chase us down to the ends of the Earth until they manage to take a picture of us kissing.

371
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,650
In order to... In order to protect Maria-san...

372
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:01,570
I'll show you that a difference in boat does not equal the difference in ability!

373
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,560
Go!

374
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,280
Jump out, youth!

375
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,870
Your head is mine!

376
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,220
Don't be hiding! It's useless! Useless! Useless!

377
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,300
Are you ready?

378
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,050
Don't come!

379
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,200
Stop that nonsense!

380
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,420
If you come any closer, I'll jump off of here!

381
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,780
Why? Why are you saying this all of a sudden?

382
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,710
What is this?

383
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,310
One of those lovers' quarrels?

384
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,880
I'm sorry. I have someone else I love other than you.

385
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,840
S-Someone you love?

386
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,150
He's a crewman on a tuna fishing boat.

387
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,490
I couldn't meet him over half the year, but...

388
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,250
It's better for you to forget about such a man!

389
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:38,770
I'll-

390
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,360
It's impossible!

391
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,030
Even if I can't see him...

392
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,530
I still...

393
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:44,740
Love him!

394
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,170
N-No!

395
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:52,800
I love him more than you, more than semi-fatty tuna, and more than fatty tuna.

396
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,150
So please forget about me.

397
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,180
Goodbye!

398
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,050
Wait.

399
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,090
Wait...

400
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,640
I...

401
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:02,890
I...

402
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,820
I...

403
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:08,290
You stupid ocean!

404
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,860
Did we just...

405
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,400
...witness the end of a love?

406
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,540
Poor Hayata-kun.

407
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:22,270
First loves are weak and sad.

408
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:27,380
Let's leave the boy with a broken heart alone.

409
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,900
You're right. Time shall cure him.

410
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,660
We'll leave what we saw today in our small memories.

411
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,630
So they locked the memory of the love in their heart.

412
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,040
Okay!

413
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,880
Let's go eat monjya at Tsukishima!

414
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,800
Agreed!

415
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:52,340
And they never recalled this day, ever.

416
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,220
Maria-san!

417
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,250
Hayate-kun.

418
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,290
We were able to get them off of us.

419
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,490
It was your amazing acting.

420
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,780
It really was nothing.

421
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,670
But, what could they have been?

422
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:15,350
Let's forget about them. I'm sure we'll never see them again.

423
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,580
How about we head home now?

424
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,010
I bet Milady is waiting-

425
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,160
Please wait.

426
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,190
Yes?

427
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:26,970
Hayate-kun, how about a ride on that before we go?

428
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,170
Thank you very much for today, Maria-san.

429
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,370
Oh, thank you, too.

430
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:43,720
But, next time, I hope you can go on a date with someone you really like.

431
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,990
Um, er...

432
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,700
What's the best way to answer this?

433
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:55,090
But before that, how about we bring Nagi along and go on a triple date?

434
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,030
Yes, I'd love to.

435
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,400
Oh, how about we take one for the end?

436
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,440
What do you think, Milady?

437
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,390
Isn't it well taken?

438
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,650
We also took pictures at Harajuku and Asakusa, so I'm sure you can draw a good manga.

439
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,710
I... think?

440
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:30,090
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!

441
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:37,340
While I was having so much trouble, you were out enjoying yourself?!

442
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:45,360
So, how about you all ask out your boyfriend or girlfriend and go out on a romantic date?

443
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,790
Only if you have one to go with, that is.

444
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,180
If you do.

445
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,090
Stop picking fights with the viewers!

446
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,830
Next week, we'll fight against problems the elderly carry.

447
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,000
Wataru and...

448
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,890
Saki's...

449
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,020
Butler Network!

450
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,650
Hey. It's Tachibana Wataru.

451
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,840
I'm Kijima Saki.

452
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,970
The theme song for Rental Video Tachibana is finally complete, so we're here today to introduce it.

453
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,300
What? This song was the shop's theme song?

454
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,970
Yeah. You didn't know?

455
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,570
But there's not a single word of
"Rental Video Tachibana" in the lyrics.

456
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:53,020
Well, that's, you know, it's the shop's image song.

457
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,050
But don't rent the song, buy it!

458
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,650
Sir! Any more than that is-

459
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,180
Oh, yeah, you're right.

460
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,480
Bye.

461
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:07,070
I had a strange dream of being the owner of a coffee bean field in Brazil and doing nothing.

462
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,460
Sure. If you want to retire, go ahead.

463
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:09,830
What?!

464
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,340
I wonder what happened to Klaus-san. He looks so sad.

465
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,060
Nagi telling him to quit must have been a real shock.

466
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,800
I am the master's shadow.

467
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,210
When I realize I can no longer be of help to Milady, I just silently disappear.

468
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,550
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

469
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,440
Klaus is Japanese because the kanji is 倉臼.

470
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,820
Did you know? Saigou Takamori's real name is Takanaga.
