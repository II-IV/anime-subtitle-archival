1
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,480
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,050
Got it?

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,700
My name is Sanzenin Nagi.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,460
Thirteen years old.

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,300
Sagittarius. Blood type: AB.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,300
My birthstone is turquoise.

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:25,720
Oh no! Maria! My dear butler got taken away by bad people!

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:34,580
Okay then! I'll transform into Mask the Money and crush them with a duralumin case with 150 million yen in it!

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,860
I'm the soldier of love, courage, money, justice, and friendship, fortitude, and victory,

10
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,950
Mask the Money!

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,400
In the name of money, I will punish you!

12
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,260
It'll be about forty years until you pay everything back.

13
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,770
Well, the debt is  pretty large.

14
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,730
With a reasonable repayment plan,
I knew it would turn out to be something like this.

15
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,750
You can't find a loan company that lends
150 million yen without interest or mortgage,

16
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,890
and allows you to pay them back as you make money.

17
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,610
You should be grateful and not hold a grudge against us.

18
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,730
Oh please, I am grateful to you.

19
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,310
Your smile is twitching.

20
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,830
Hayate fears on account of the amount of money he borrowed.

21
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,060
His spring is still far away.

22
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,530
A butler is one who serves.

23
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,030
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

24
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:30,030
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

25
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes.

26
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:40,130
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

27
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,150
My spring is still far away...

28
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,650
What? Only three people live in this mansion?

29
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,630
Yeah, since this is one of the smallest secondary houses we own,

30
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,630
so we don't need many attendants around.

31
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,730
Really? This is small?

32
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:38,160
But, if there aren't people around at all, it makes me nervous.

33
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,700
Over what?

34
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,340
Well, I'll be living here from now, right?

35
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,510
Even though it's so large, to be living under the same roof with a beautiful girl is...

36
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,680
I-Idiot! Don't put it that way.

37
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,510
Although it's "under the same roof",
it's not like we'll be sleeping in the same room.

38
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:00,030
But still, it makes me nervous.

39
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,110
Nervous?

40
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,860
You know how beautiful Maria-san is, right?

41
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,090
What do you mean by that?

42
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,370
Just so you know, if you touch Maria, I won't just kill you.

43
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,830
I'll put you under forty-eight murderous attacks and fifty-two submissions,

44
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,250
followed by turning you into minced meat through a roller.

45
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,080
Um... "touch her"?

46
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:32,370
With the new year approaching, this is how my new life began.

47
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,240
It's New Years Eve already.

48
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,460
This really was a hectic year.

49
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,180
The house I was supposed to have lived in was completely empty.

50
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,700
Didn't even feel like going out to search for my parents,

51
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,650
so I accepted Milady's kindness and decided to be a butler at this Sanzenin's mansion.

52
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:01,050
True, the amount of debt is large, but I must work hard not to get fired from this job!

53
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,170
So Maria-san, what exactly am I supposed to do?

54
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,320
I still don't have a clear image of the job description.

55
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
Let's see, simply put...

56
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,020
...be Nagi's pet.

57
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,240
P-Pet?

58
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,860
I'm only joking.

59
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:26,440
I think you'll gradually understand it,
so for the time being, could you go wake Nagi up?

60
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,140
Y-Yes!

61
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,980
So we have the study, piano room,
study hall, reading room, wardrobe,

62
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,400
Playstation room, Dreamcast room, N64 room.

63
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,430
Is there a reason to separate these?

64
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,410
It's here.

65
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,990
Good morning, Milady.

66
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,790
It's morning.

67
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,800
If you don't wake up, your breakfast is going to get cold.

68
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,730
Calm down. Calm down Hayate.

69
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,960
It can't be.

70
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,290
It has to be a 1/1 scale figure made by ******.

71
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:10,620
No, it's ***y! It has to be ***y!
It's must be their new **** for Playstation 5!

72
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,990
Man, ***y's technology sure is the best in the world. It's amazing.

73
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,220
Ah, Hayate?

74
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,390
You came to wake me up? Thank you.

75
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,160
By the way, why are you paralyzed?

76
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,760
Well, ah... behind you.

77
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,740
Oh, no wonder it was hot; Tama was sleeping with me.

78
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,880
Tama? You treat it like a cat with that huge body?

79
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,020
Hey, wake up Tama. Otherwise your breakfast is going to get away.

80
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,950
Stop, or else you'll become the breakfast.

81
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,720
M-Milady, hold on a second.

82
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,350
Idiot, I'm just getting up, so don't stare at me.

83
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:54,360
No! Well that's the correct reaction for the older audiences, but that's not what I'm concerned about right now!

84
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,050
Looks like you're really panicking over Tama.

85
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,660
Pathetic.

86
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,040
Utterly pathetic, Ayasaki Hayate!

87
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,590
Where are you coming out from?

88
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,470
Um, this person is?

89
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,350
Right, you haven't met him yet, have you?

90
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,850
My name is Klaus.

91
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,400
I am the head butler of this Sanzenin family.

92
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,510
Head butler? So you're my superior.

93
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,580
Wait, it's not the time for that!

94
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,130
Milady, it's dangerous!

95
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,790
Dangerous? What are you saying? It's only a cat.

96
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,090
No, that's a...

97
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,500
A tiger, I tell you. It's a tiger.

98
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,590
Why you... And I was about to finally comment on it!

99
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,700
Listen boy.

100
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,000
When Milady says it's a cat, it's a cat.

101
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,540
This is the White Tiger Cat, Tama.

102
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,550
You just said it's a "tiger" yourself!

103
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,770
You have to lock this dangerous and fearsome-looking beast inside a cage right away!

104
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,960
Looks like that long phrase just got on Tama's nerves.

105
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,590
Just to let you know, Tama is a stupid cat that hasn't taken a liking to anyone but Milady and Maria.

106
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,730
Anyone who bothers this stupid cat's mood will immediately become a sacrifice.

107
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,800
Which means, it hasn't taken a liking to you, either, has it?

108
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,010
Of... Of course you like me, right, Tama?

109
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,990
Tama, that's enough.

110
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:36,240
Geez, so noisy this early in the morning.

111
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,710
Thank you very much, Milady. You saved me.

112
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,530
Tama, if you're a Sanzenin's cat,
then you've got to understand what you're doing.

113
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,830
If you're going to play...

114
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,110
...do it outside.

115
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:53,210
Damn it, don't be so full of yourself!

116
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,020
Don't think this is the first time I've fought a beast.

117
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:05,170
I may not look like it, but I used to sneak into the safari park...

118
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,250
...to steal the lions' food to feed my parents some meat!

119
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,940
Now that's my Hayate.

120
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,350
Looks like he can play evenly with Tama, too.

121
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,770
I wonder about that.

122
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,230
How many butler candidates have lost to Tama so far?

123
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,440
Hayate won't lose against Tama!

124
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:24,720
Then when he loses, disqualify him as a butler and have him leave here.

125
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,900
Sure, fire him or whatever you want to do.

126
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,810
So if I can't beat a tiger barehanded, I'm back to being unemployed?

127
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:35,720
Besides, at the safari park, I was basically just running around.

128
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:35,720
Hayate!

129
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,700
Good luck!

130
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:44,040
Oh well. My life once ended that Christmas Day.

131
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,840
I have to do my best not to fall short of her expectations.

132
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,500
Here I go!

133
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,250
Um, Milady?

134
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,140
It's been bothering me for a while now, but...

135
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,070
The place where they're fighting is...

136
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,070
All right.

137
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,390
I hope the cyclamens have bloomed.

138
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,070
I give up! I give up, Tama!

139
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,860
There's no way a human can win against a tiger barehanded!

140
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,900
At least give me a knife!

141
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,790
A knife!

142
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,210
Tama?

143
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,140
What are you doing?

144
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,880
M-Maria-san.

145
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:39,880
I have told you many times you cannot play here since I am growing flowers here.

146
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,300
Did you do this?

147
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,940
Um...

148
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:54,130
Or, maybe the two up there set this up, saying that Hayate-kun is fired if he cannot win against Tama?

149
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,970
I will be up once I finish treating Hayate-kun, so could you wait with breakfast for a while?

150
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,000
Y-Yes, Sir.

151
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,880
Okay...

152
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,480
I am sorry; I will be sure to lecture them later.

153
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,940
I-It's fine.

154
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,220
But why do you have a tiger here?

155
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,510
A lot has happened.

156
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,190
He does not have anywhere to go.

157
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,300
But what about the zoo?

158
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,200
Yes, well... It's an embarrassing story, but...

159
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,460
Nagi found Tama alone, away from his mother in Africa, and nurtured him like a cat, and...

160
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:44,100
...he learned the luxurious life of eating only Matsuzaka beef or fatty tuna and receiving tri-weekly massages.

161
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,400
So not only the wild, but he will not even stand the life in the zoo.

162
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,530
But he never hurts Nagi,
and if it is for Nagi, he fights to the death.

163
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:02,500
He seems to have a good understanding of what would have happened if he had not met Nagi.

164
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,200
"If he had not met Nagi."

165
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,880
I see, so you're the same as me.

166
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:21,110
Don't treat me the same as you, you failure at life! Idiot!

167
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,490
What's with that impoverished look on your face?

168
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,790
Go get run over by a Mars trooper and die, you fool.

169
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:34,240
Oh, and don't tell the others that I can speak, got it?

170
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,090
I-I see, so rich people's pets can talk.

171
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,990
Tama was nurtured with much love,
so he learned how to speak the human language.

172
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,680
But Hayate is the only person to know that fact.

173
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,920
Thin konnyaku.

174
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,920
Intruder!

175
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,580
Anyway, I'm against taking him in as butler!

176
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,700
I see.

177
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,090
Is it this mustache that's speaking nonsense?

178
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,020
Is it this mustache, Klaus?

179
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,540
I decided to hire him to thank him for saving me.

180
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,450
I promised that I would choose a replacement for Himegami.

181
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:24,220
Besides, you're out of your mind to want to hire a poor-looking guy like him!

182
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:29,350
Y-Yes, he has a poor man's face,

183
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,800
but that could calm people down.

184
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,390
Hayate is one of those that eases your heart!

185
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:37,920
If you want a moment of ease in your heart,
get a hamster or something.

186
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,590
Unfortunately, hamsters are too soothing.

187
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,930
Hayate's poorness is what I like.

188
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,870
Hiring a boy who's so pathetic and looks like he'll never have any luck with money for the rest of his life...

189
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,810
...will only make the people around him poor, too!

190
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,810
They both do not mean what they are saying to be taken badly.

191
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,640
I know.

192
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,790
We don't know when you'll get involved in a kidnapping case like the other day,

193
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:03,200
so we can't hire anyone who doesn't have the will to fight for the master by risking their own life.

194
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,360
Fight for the master by risking their own life?

195
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,730
Strength, you ask? Then there's nothing to worry about.

196
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,540
True, Hayate-kun's body is sturdier than most others.

197
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,100
He was able to play with Tama, after all.

198
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,240
That's not all.

199
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,610
So you know, every time Hayate transforms, his power level increases dramatically.

200
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,580
And Hayate still has two more transformations left in him.

201
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,840
Do you understand what I mean by this?

202
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,160
There is no such thing as that.

203
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,680
There isn't?

204
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,950
Are you sure?

205
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,210
I'm not ****za.

206
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,850
So even if you give me that look...

207
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:43,160
If you see a problem with Hayate-kun's strength or potential, how about testing him?

208
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,870
A test?

209
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,930
Yes.

210
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:52,680
If he truly can protect Milady, then I am sure he can swim through a boiling pool of tar.

211
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:58,490
True. An applicable man should be able to fall from two thousand meters above ground and be fine.

212
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,230
Um, hello?

213
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,680
Okay, I accept that challenge.

214
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,290
Um, I don't have a say in this?

215
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:09,170
Then please hold on for a while.
I'll get the test ready right away.

216
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,990
Sure. Bring guns, arrows, or whatever you want!

217
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,120
I'm not really sure what this test is about, but is it safe?

218
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,370
In various ways.

219
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,900
Don't worry.

220
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,970
I'm sure you'll manage.

221
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:31,610
Um, Maria-san. Does Milady have high hopes for me?

222
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,960
High hopes?

223
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,260
She tends to be shy around people she doesn't know and doesn't show expressions to others often.

224
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,900
Especially after Himegami-kun left, she hasn't smiled much.

225
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,130
So it's been a while to see her so energetic.

226
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,600
She must have been really happy that you saved her.

227
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:58,420
I sure do have the "for the sake of money" portion in my heart,

228
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,740
but if she has high hopes on me,

229
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,540
then I want to be equal to her hopes.

230
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,040
Are you ready?

231
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,750
This is the exam to test your applicability.

232
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,420
This is...

233
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,430
Um, this is?

234
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:27,430
Nursing Robot 8, made by one of the companies under Sanzenin's authorities!

235
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:31,200
I've been expecting you, Ayasaki Hayate-san.

236
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,550
You're not about to tell me to fight this, are you?

237
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,550
Don't be ridiculous. That's a nursing robot.

238
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:40,510
In other words, the ultimate butler made to serve its master!

239
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:47,320
Using the regular household material here,
I will have you and 8 fight and see who's a better butler.

240
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,220
Milady?

241
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:53,170
It's a very ugly robot.

242
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,900
But this is the nursing robot with the world's latest technology.

243
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,280
Latest technology?

244
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,340
This?

245
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:04,180
Wouldn't you want to die if you found yourself being taken care of by an ugly robot like this?

246
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,470
Oh please...

247
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:11,010
Anyways, Hayate wouldn't lose a robot that won't transform or combine.

248
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:11,540
Right?

249
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,980
Ah...

250
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,680
I-If you want to see transformations or combining that badly...

251
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,680
...I'll transform you !

252
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,940
Damn, I missed.

253
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,050
What short-tempered latest technology.

254
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,200
It's no time to make that kind of comment!

255
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,030
Please stop it already!

256
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,220
Once I'm in motion, no one can stop my hot pistons.

257
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,300
You stay quiet!

258
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,530
Klaus-san?

259
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:48,810
To stop it, you need to open the panel
in the back and type in the password, 1192...

260
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,980
Hayate-kun! It'll stop if you break it!

261
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,010
Hey!

262
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,260
So it does come to that.

263
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,620
Hayate!

264
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,250
That's right; I have to protect Milady.

265
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,330
Since I'm going to become her butler.

266
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,220
I'm going to get serious now.

267
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,700
Stay behind, please, Milady.

268
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,150
Is he really made for nursing?

269
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,420
Launch!

270
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,660
I'm sure it's necessary equipment for women living alone.

271
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,830
Like a countermeasure against stalkers.

272
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,030
Sounds really fishy.

273
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:44,780
Brat, don't think you can keep running away from me.

274
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,340
Hayate!

275
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,010
What?

276
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,000
Hey, that's the water pipe!

277
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,520
I see. Machines are weak against water.

278
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,620
And who's doing the clean-up?

279
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,620
Who cares about water.

280
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,860
Japan's waterproofing treatment is the best in the world!

281
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,320
Now!

282
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,030
Th-This is...

283
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,870
You got it right. Pure silver knives that are more susceptible to conductive electricity than stainless steel.

284
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:21,150
And right below you is soaked wool carpetting.

285
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,050
And here's the 100V electricity!

286
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,950
Stop, if you use that in this situation, you'll get electrocuted, too.

287
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,850
I'm sure I would.

288
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:36,850
But apparently, protecting the master even at the cost of your own is a butler's job.

289
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,860
Hayate.

290
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,780
No matter how much you act cool,
you'll be poor for the rest of your life.

291
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,520
Buster Cholerae!!

292
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,290
W-Why Cholerae?

293
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,290
And it's done!

294
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,170
But nobody copy this move, okay?

295
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,660
That was surprisingly fast.

296
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,680
You still have problems with Hayate?

297
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:09,590
Fine. We'll hire him until we find a better one.

298
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:20,370
With the sound of the bell,
the new year is about to come to Japan.

299
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,200
Goodbye, last year. Hello, new year.

300
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:28,270
I hope the best New Year to you all.

301
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,610
You're awake! I was worried about you.

302
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,830
Milady.

303
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,980
What happened with my test?

304
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,380
Of course, you passed.

305
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,740
Thank goodness.

306
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,270
But I turned that room into a mess.

307
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,240
I'm sorry.

308
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,500
Don't worry.

309
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,490
There are enough rooms here.

310
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,780
But there isn't a replacement for you.

311
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,280
Milady.

312
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,460
Well, so, you know... I was happy that you protected me.

313
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,110
So, um...

314
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,190
K-Keep-

315
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,590
Keep up the good work, Hayate!

316
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,290
Yes. You can count on me, Milady.

317
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,900
There are still many problems ahead, but looks like he will do fine here.

318
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,820
And that day, I made a promise.

319
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,370
That I would protect Milady even at the cost of my life.

320
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,050
Hey, you, are you listening?

321
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,470
What?

322
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:50,030
It's your fault for talking for three episodes.

323
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,340
Look, even the sakura petals are starting to fall.

324
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,460
So what?!

325
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,270
Let's pick up where we left off!

326
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,630
Up I go.

327
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,670
Prepare yourself!

328
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:11,740
This long battle sequence that started in episode one will finally come to an end!

329
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,910
Hayate!

330
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,970
Die!

331
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,550
And this is how the boy became a legend. No, I mean a butler.

332
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,640
Next week, he'll fight against school!

333
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,720
You're not a student of Hakuou, are you?

334
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,560
Who are you?

335
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,690
Um, I'm...

336
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,150
Don't lie to me!

337
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,850
I haven't said anything, yet.

338
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:13,440
Did Hayate-kun get caught up in another mess?

339
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,030
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

340
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:18,470
First Mission. This is Snake. No One's Responding.

341
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:22,940
Ayasaki-kun, if you don't become a little bit more selfish,
you won't catch your happiness.

342
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,650
Have you ever felt the cosmos around you?
