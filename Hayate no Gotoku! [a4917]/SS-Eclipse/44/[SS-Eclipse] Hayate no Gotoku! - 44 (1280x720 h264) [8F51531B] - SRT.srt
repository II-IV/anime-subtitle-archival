1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,920
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,750
Splash!

3
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,430
Tada!

4
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,440
Voila!

5
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,830
What are you doing?!

6
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,020
Hey, why are you interrupting me?

7
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,040
People are going to wonder what show just started.

8
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,300
As you can see, it's a new opening.

9
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,430
A new opening?

10
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:00,530
Yes. To commemorate the 44th episode, my manga is going to get animated.

11
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,310
Didn't we do something similar to this in the past?

12
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,980
Furthermore, KOTOKO-san will be singing it starting next week.

13
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,740
No, she won't!

14
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,920
Here's the real opening theme.

15
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:17,160
Did you all know that there's a huge mansion like this in the middle of Tokyo?

16
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,930
The name of the mistress who lives there is Sanzenin Nagi.

17
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:20,660
And...

18
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,920
Her butler's name is Ayasaki Hayate.

19
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,740
The two are slightly airheaded...

20
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,130
...and they misunderstand each other a bit...

21
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,150
...but they are bound by a tight master-butler bond.

22
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,780
This week's Hayate no Gotoku is fictional
and does not depict any actual person or organization.

23
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,590
It's always like that.

24
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,640
What do you think of this complete version of Magical Destroy?

25
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,480
People often say it's hard to understand, so I made it simpler.

26
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,690
Um...

27
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,770
Yeah? Yeah?

28
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,490
I don't see much of a difference from before.

29
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:36,600
What? I went and edited it to target the general public audience, and yet you still don't understand?!

30
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,620
Even if you say that...

31
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:45,400
Don't you see the extremeness of the upcoming battle expressed in the waves from the Sea of Japan?

32
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,690
Hahahaha! I've finally found you, Britney!

33
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,570
What! Could that voice be... Who's there!

34
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,670
I've come all the way to the Sea of Japan to defeat you...

35
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,570
Your enemy!

36
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,880
Damn! An enemy! Then I have no choice but to fight!

37
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,020
That's right! You have no choice but to fight!

38
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,020
But since you declare yourself to be an enemy...

39
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,730
You must be strong!

40
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,900
No, I'm sorry. I'm not that strong!
Since I'm only an enemy early in the series.

41
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,790
Wh-What's the matter, Maria?

42
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,970
Is this one of those games where
you lose when you point out the faults?

43
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,390
What do you mean?

44
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,760
The enemy appears so soon as the third page.

45
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,140
It's such an exciting development.

46
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,910
But he's claiming he's not strong...

47
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,160
Besides, what journey is she on?

48
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,820
It's interesting, Nagi.

49
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,910
What?!

50
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,920
Actually, when did you come in, Isumi-san?

51
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,450
Yes! As expected from Isumi.

52
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,060
It was very interesting, so I wrote a follow up.

53
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,900
SFX: Sparkle

54
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,000
What did she say?!

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,930
Life of a Kitty.

56
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,380
A kitty with wings was flying in the sky.

57
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,910
After much analysis from multiple angles,

58
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,410
the speed of flight was 23km/h.

59
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,060
It's marvelous, Isumi!

60
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,690
That's the flavor I was looking for!

61
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,560
I knew it.

62
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,400
Looks like they're at it again.

63
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,690
Sakuya-san, when did you get here?

64
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,520
Aren't those two something?

65
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,420
Yes. Their conversations are in a different dimension from us.

66
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,380
They actually understand each other with that, so it's amazing.

67
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,820
But, is it really that difficult to draw a manga?

68
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,680
If you can draw well and come up with
fairly well-planned plots, it's not hard to get a prize.

69
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,770
Don't let such a controversial statement slip!

70
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,810
If I remember correctly, you received a prize in a manga competition, right, Hayate-kun?

71
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,500
Hey, that's amazing!

72
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,010
I never read Hayate's manga, either.

73
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,650
I'd like to read it, too.

74
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,930
Sure, I don't mind.

75
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,960
My name is Britney.

76
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,490
As you can see, I work part-time as a flower girl.

77
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,300
Usually, I make so many mistakes,
seduced by the fragrance of the flowers,

78
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,470
SFX: Ghoooo

79
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,760
so the store manager always yells at me.

80
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,170
But, there are bad guys that come to
the flower shop, lured in by the fragrance.

81
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,130
No worries, though!

82
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:05,020
My magic will repel them right away!

83
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,840
That's right! I'm a Magical Girl!

84
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,150
Flower Magical Girl, Britney-chan!

85
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,440
It nails down all the key features,
so it's pissing me off, strangely enough.

86
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,900
It's even colored.

87
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,790
The pictures are very cute, yet why do I sense naughtiness?

88
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,370
Looks like I'm not getting good reactions.

89
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,920
What do you think, Isumi?

90
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,770
It feels like he's trying to hit
the audience's sweet spot right off the bat.

91
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,330
I agree.

92
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,440
If you make a work as if you're sucking up to
the audience while making fools out of them,

93
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,610
you may be able to trick the judge's eyes,
but you'll never catch a true audience's heart!

94
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,920
I-I'm sorry.

95
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,170
Rather than that, what's going to happen in Nagi's manga after this?

96
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,490
I'm still working on the storyboard beyond that.

97
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,720
Let's just hear the overall flow, then.

98
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,620
That would be nice.

99
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,310
What, this? You're all interested in what happens next?

100
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,620
Not necessarily.

101
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,900
Okay, you leave me no choice. Let me tell you.

102
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,500
Thank you.

103
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,600
Fugitive General and Dark Fugitive,
whom he brought with him from the twelfth dimension,

104
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,040
change all of humanity to worker ants and plan to take over the world.

105
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,440
In order to do that, they start to stock up on sugar in the futures market.

106
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,680
The worldwide lack of sugar caused by this makes Britney decide to go on an eight dimension-wide journey.

107
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,540
Because she loves cake and stuff.

108
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,700
She's a girl, after all.

109
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:25,990
But at the same time, Helmintians from the M-2983 galaxy come to Earth for its oil resources and awaken the ancie-

110
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,940
Stop, Nagi!

111
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,200
Why are you stopping me?!

112
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,920
It was just getting to the good part!

113
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,270
How so?

114
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:37,510
Milady, you have to make it clearer,
or else people won't understand you.

115
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,630
Yeah. It doesn't make sense.

116
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:43,210
How dare you? I'm explaining it for your sakes.

117
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,010
Yes, but...

118
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:44,940
I know!

119
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,440
Let's see... I thought it was somewhere around here.

120
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,090
Where are we going, Milady?

121
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,150
Found it!

122
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,060
What? Ramen?

123
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,240
Welcom-

124
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,650
T-To the table in the back, please.

125
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:17,710
Let me use this facility to tell you how great my manga is.

126
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,310
How do we do "use the facility" at a ramen shop?

127
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,150
Looks like we've arrived.

128
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,920
What is this place?!

129
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,880
Could this place be the rumored...

130
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,350
End of drawing cut 82.

131
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,260
I'm here to get the finished product.

132
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,040
Here.

133
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,180
Good work.

134
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,170
Kaboom! Smack!

135
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,100
Here's the finished product.

136
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,910
Okay.

137
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,630
"Kyahoo."

138
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,670
"But Daddy's not here."

139
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,460
Here.

140
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,450
Good work.

141
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,440
Finished cut check.

142
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
Thank you.

143
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,780
What is this place?

144
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,400
It looks related to animation.

145
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,850
Yes. It's where animations are made.

146
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:13,860
Eh?!

147
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,700
I knew it.

148
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:23,310
So the urban legend of anime studios usually being camouflaged as ramen shops and hiding from commoners was true.

149
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,200
There's an urban legend such as that?

150
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,330
How mysterious!

151
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:33,050
Let me remind you that this work is fictional and does not depict the actual industry.

152
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,210
So this is where anime is made.

153
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,350
I can feel the tension like one.

154
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,020
I remember coming here around episode 35.

155
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,970
That's Segawa-san, Hanabishi-san, and Asakaze-san.

156
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,540
Why are they here?

157
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,530
Excuse me, where do I find the voice actors?

158
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,270
They're at the audio studio.

159
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,930
What? They're not here?

160
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,650
I was hoping to see Yahagi-san here.

161
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,650
Note: Yahagi Sayuri is Izumi's voice actress

162
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,310
Wow, it's really moving!

163
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,790
Well then, let me draw something, too.

164
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,380
What's the matter, Maria-san?

165
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,830
Over there...

166
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,390
Poke. Poke.

167
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,410
She's only sleeping.

168
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,100
I'll get it done by today, somehow...

169
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,860
She's not asleep. She collapsed.

170
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,510
A break for a worrier.

171
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,740
So Milady, what do you intend to do here?

172
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,590
I'm going to have them animate the rest of my manga.

173
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,290
Nagi's manga?!

174
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,090
Animate it?!

175
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:47,000
Yes. I figured it'd be easier to explain through an anime rather than words.

176
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,730
Doesn't animation usually come after the manga proves its popularity?

177
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,630
So excited. Can't wait.

178
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,000
Continues in the second half!

179
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,900
Terere terere tte.

180
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,350
Terere tte nanika no jyumon nano?

181
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,350
Terere tte nanika no jyumon nano? = Is "Terere" some chant for a spell?

182
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,160
This scene. It should be like **** eating away the planet.

183
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,810
Naturally, don't use any CG. All by hand.

184
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,920
And like the L***ta's climax, make it dramatic.

185
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,830
And then like the opening of
P*****yo the Movie, make it crash down.

186
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,800
Ah, the first one, mind you.

187
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,140
The last will be just like the finale from Sen*****.

188
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,270
Will this kind of explanation really make sense to them?

189
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,560
I'm not sure.

190
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,750
That's all. Get it done in one week please.

191
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,300
It's impossible.

192
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,640
Out of question.

193
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,540
You're underestimating the animation process, aren't you?

194
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,230
Hello?

195
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,440
Yes! Right away!

196
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,310
Guys.

197
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,450
Whisper whisper whisper.

198
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,930
R-Right away!

199
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,720
We'll get on it right now.

200
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,140
Oh yeah? Thank you.

201
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:48,820
Go!

202
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,230
Nagi, what did you do?

203
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,230
I don't know. I didn't do anything.

204
00:11:56,150 --> 00:12:02,430
Actually, I remember a rumor going around saying
the stock of the company will go up if it makes my anime.

205
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,000
It must be that.

206
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,580
As we've said many times, this is fictional and does not depict the real industry.

207
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,490
So this is how animation with iffy quality comes to the world.

208
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,350
Good luck with this show.

209
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,780
Is the storyboard not ready yet?

210
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,900
It should be ready soon, but the director went to To**"*"*s to buy a limited edition figure.

211
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,380
Have someone go pick him up! This is a job!

212
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:33,140
We've got the setting down good,
but we don't have enough people to draw.

213
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,430
We have a problem! The writer got tendonitis.

214
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,970
What's the matter?

215
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,530
We're short on staff that can draw.

216
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,520
What? Then you can't make an anime.

217
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,460
Can't you go pick some out from other companies?

218
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,580
Like ***ani.

219
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,780
No, I think that's a little...

220
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:56,270
Anyway, an animation originating from Lady Nagi is in production.

221
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,910
Looks like we'll make it on time.

222
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,600
We didn't take any casualties, either.

223
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,240
Although a few did collapse.

224
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,380
Good enough.

225
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,760
The anime industry is rigorous, isn't it?

226
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,010
We have a problem!

227
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,360
The company that's supposed to do the animation touch up vanished!

228
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,040
Looks like we're boxed in.

229
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,110
Very well.

230
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:39,460
I have no choice but to resort to the trick!

231
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,000
Milady, what do you intend on doing?

232
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,610
What should I eat tonight?

233
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,010
What? What happened here?

234
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:57,240
I left the color out of the Hamster scene, so recycle all the staff you want.

235
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,400
Is it all right to do this?

236
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,050
What is this?

237
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,000
You're so mean, Nagi-chan!

238
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,790
What is this?

239
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:09,200
It's called rough dubbing. It's a temporary picture used when the picture isn't ready when the dubbing process begins.

240
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,680
I see. Something similar to making film that the audience doesn't get to see.

241
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,300
Wow. So this is how anime is made.

242
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,070
Yes. And furthermore...

243
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,780
Wh-Wh-What?! What's happened now?!

244
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:29,160
When the schedule is really tight,
the rough design pictures get thrown right in.

245
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,740
In the worst cases, they take it right off the storyboards.

246
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,150
Or even just a color marker line.

247
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,400
There are many variations.

248
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,010
Bring me back!

249
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,330
We no longer use film, so this doesn't happen.

250
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,470
Rough dubbing is so interesting.

251
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,750
This is basically how things are during dubbing.

252
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,900
Hey, you shouldn't be giving those facts out.

253
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,370
It's not like we're resorting to them because we like to!

254
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:52,520
We do want to have it completely colored during dubbing.

255
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,730
If only we had more leeway in the schedule.

256
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,050
Oh, and the budget, too.

257
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,810
Let's end all the inside jokes
around here. The anime is finally complete.

258
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,230
I'm starting to get nervous.

259
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,310
Me, too, Milady.

260
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,540
Excited. Can't wait.

261
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,510
I can't wait to see it.

262
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,220
I plan on crying three times during this movie.

263
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,010
It's starting.

264
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,920
I wonder what kind of legendary
unbelievable anime this has become.

265
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,200
Excited. Can't wait.

266
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,480
Maria-san. We've come this far, so let's be ready for anything.

267
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,960
May as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb.

268
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,960
Note: A Japanese idiom roughly meaning
"We've come this far, no turning back now."

269
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:39,610
Hi to all 130,000,000 Girl A's out there!

270
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,900
At ani**te, the Hayate no Gotoku fair is going on!

271
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,800
Grab the merchandise with your passionate hands,

272
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,930
and slam it down onto the checkout counter along with the contents of your wallet!

273
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,740
Milady, what was that?

274
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,860
A tie-in. I thought about putting some commercials in there, too.

275
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,110
Here comes the feature show.

276
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,010
Britney always looks at her senpai from a distance.

277
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,560
What? What is this picture?

278
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,340
Um, Senpai!

279
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,540
I made lunch. Would you like to eat with me?

280
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,610
Ah, that sounds good. Let us.

281
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,590
What? I'm in the show.

282
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,540
Yes, what is this?

283
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,940
Britney loves her senpai so much.

284
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,570
But she can never bring herself to say that.

285
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:31,070
Because she's a magical girl!? That isn't the reason.

286
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,980
Because the senpai... senpai has!

287
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,540
He already has a wife and a child.

288
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,470
I-It really is a surprising development.

289
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,900
I can't really accept the character setting.

290
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,670
The more you stir-

291
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,450
But due to an evil witch's power-

292
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,180
Neru Neru Ne~

293
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,520
Senpai was turned into a star.

294
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,130
Because of that, the wife fell sick,

295
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,410
and the child became a punk.

296
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,540
When you're about to lose in
a net game, just cut the network off!

297
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,170
The tension is starting to build.

298
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,010
Britney decides to return senpai back to human form.

299
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,440
But even if she succeeds, senpai will return to his wife's side.

300
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,810
There is no chance of him getting together with Britney.

301
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:32,080
However, if she goes on a journey, she will be able to be with senpai,

302
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,930
even if he's star-shaped now.

303
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,560
What will you do, Britney?

304
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,000
The decision Britney made is:

305
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,430
Life of a Kitty.

306
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,400
Run. Run. Run. Run.

307
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,730
Run. Run. Run. Run.

308
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,140
The speed at which it runs is Mach 5.

309
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,850
But no matter how fast it runs, it can't reach the sun.

310
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,380
Fin.

311
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:05,560
Y-You really are a genius, Isumi.

312
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,540
You think so, too?

313
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,140
How was it? Did you understand my manga a little-

314
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,290
What's wrong?

315
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,170
Come in.

316
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,890
Oh, Maria-san.

317
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,460
Hayate-kun.

318
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,670
You're here, as well.

319
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:36,040
Does that mean you're here for the same reason as me?

320
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,660
Yes. I wanted to read Milady's manga one more time.

321
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,900
Since she did put a lot of effort into drawing it.

322
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,500
Yes. We should understand it more.

323
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:51,600
Also, I'm eager to find out what happens to Britney-chan and the senpai.

324
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,780
I am, too, a little.

325
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,040
But, Hataye-kun.

326
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,480
Yes?

327
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,060
What do you think Britney-chan will choose in the end?

328
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,350
To be with him, or...

329
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,750
Unfortunately, Nagi hasn't written the rest yet.

330
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:17,160
Then I guess Milady hasn't made a decision yet as to how this love ends.

331
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:21,270
What would you pick, Maria-san?

332
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,330
Me?

333
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,880
Let's see...

334
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:32,690
If that senpai is Hayate-kun, it might not be so bad to keep you in star form forever.

335
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,740
There you go, being mean again.

336
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,370
Ah, then how about you draw the rest?

337
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,830
Me?

338
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,590
But I've never drawn a manga before.

339
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,490
Then more so.

340
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:50,240
I can't, Hayate-kun. I'm...

341
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,700
If you're a man, score all the heroines at once!

342
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,000
Who is this, Maria-san?

343
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,910
Hayate-kun.

344
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:04,200
Please hold on. "Score all the heroines at once?" Am I a rapist?

345
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,420
You don't like it?

346
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,420
In that case-

347
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,220
You'd better make your choice.

348
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,080
It's your turn to draw one now, Hayate-kun.

349
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,810
Eh, but...

350
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,610
Goodness, you're such an indecisive person.

351
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:25,060
At times, fiction can mirror reality.

352
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,630
Next time-

353
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,550
Hold on!

354
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:32,290
Man, we almost forgot to insert the service shot.

355
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,040
Even the level of service is way up there.

356
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,470
Please have this to wash out your eyes.

357
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,560
This isn't meant to fill the extra time.

358
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,030
Hayate no Gotoku is filled with fan service.

359
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:51,240
Let's make sure to watch next week, too!

360
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,520
Hold on! Does this count as service, too?!

361
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,950
Student Council Trio's

362
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,160
Butler Network!

363
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,830
Nyaha. I'm Segawa Izumi.

364
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,230
Hm. I'm Asakaze Risa.

365
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,650
Osu! I'm Hanabishi Miki.

366
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,620
Finally, our work of friendship and effort,

367
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,910
Student Council Trio's theme song is complete!

368
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:42,980
It was a long road taken.

369
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,870
This song is perfect for broadcasting in school.

370
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,320
It'll be good to play it during cleaning time.

371
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,920
It's perfect to listen to with your date.

372
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,230
Play it in your car stereo and your girlfriend will be stunned.

373
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,310
It's perfect for lonely people living alone, too.

374
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,710
It might become the motivation in life.

375
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:56,570
We'll be showing our service shots the next three weeks, too.

376
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,150
This week, it's me!

377
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:58,870
Next week will be me!

378
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,780
Adios.

379
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,420
Where are we going all of a sudden?

380
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,420
I wonder where.

381
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,960
It'll be a surprise of when we get there.

382
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:13,250
We call it, "Maria-san, thank you so much all the time. Gratitude to our Onee-sama, Relax Plan."

383
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,770
Thank you so much for working so hard for us all the time.

384
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,220
Stay at a hotel in the city; enjoy the spa and aesthetic salon.

385
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,510
Forget about work and just relax.

386
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,390
Next week, It's Maria-san Thank You Day in February!

387
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,080
Next week, prism crash into Hayate!
