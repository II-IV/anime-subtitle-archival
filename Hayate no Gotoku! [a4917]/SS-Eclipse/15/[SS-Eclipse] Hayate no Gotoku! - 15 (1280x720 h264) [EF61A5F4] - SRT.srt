1
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:09,430
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,050
Got it?

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,650
All right, I will do this!

4
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,170
I will eat a large one all by myself.

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,970
No, I mean I'll charge up my energy
and get ready for tomorrow's exam.

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,720
Hayate-kun, I wonder what you had for dinner.

7
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,490
It was supposed to be a dream that was never going to come true for the debt-ridden butler.

8
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,180
It wasn't a dream.

9
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,210
I can go to school again.

10
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,850
This is all thanks to Maria-san writing a recommendation for me.

11
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,310
M-Maria-san?

12
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,120
Therefore...

13
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,040
...go here and learn everything you can.

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,720
This is Hakuou Academy's...

15
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,690
My student ID?

16
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,880
Watch me closely, Maria-san.

17
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,270
In order to meet your expectations...

18
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,710
All right.

19
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:34,480
I will go to Hakuou Academy and become the best butler!

20
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,080
Going to school does not make you the best butler.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,580
A butler is one who serves.

22
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,100
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

23
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:52,000
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

24
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,280
Yes.

25
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:01,930
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

26
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,240
I'll show you all there is to being the best butler.

27
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,570
Aren't you in a good mood, Hayate-kun?

28
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,580
Hinagiku-san! You stayed here last night?

29
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,370
G-Good morning.

30
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:53,980
Good morning.

31
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,520
B-But what's wrong? You seem to be in a bad mood.

32
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,740
"Why"?

33
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,490
Oh. You disappeared all of a sudden last night,

34
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,050
and you wouldn't return even after it got late,

35
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,730
and we couldn't find you no matter how much we searched,

36
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,880
and you think nobody worried about you?!

37
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,060
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry.

38
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,020
But, judging by looking at you, you did pass, right?

39
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,440
Ah, yes. Thanks to everyone.

40
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,060
Then I'll forgive you.

41
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,150
I'll head home now, but if you see me at school,
make sure you say hi.

42
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,710
Ah, yes. Roger that.

43
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,370
Good.

44
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,060
Students at the same school, eh?

45
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,060
So, you've been holding the student ID the entire night?

46
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,970
Yes. I slept with it in my hands.

47
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,910
Seriously, why are you so cute?

48
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,870
You must have been really excited.

49
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:07,140
Yes. Right now, I understand the feeling of people in musicals and how they start singing all of a sudden.

50
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,240
No need for you to.

51
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,090
Besides, there aren't any character songs
made for this situation.

52
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,980
And the production of a musical anime involves work.

53
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,600
Oh right. What do I do for my uniform?

54
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,540
Uniform?

55
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,840
Yes. Hakuou has a school uniform, right?

56
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,680
I can't go in my butler uniform.

57
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,900
You don't need a school uniform.

58
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,460
You are right. That would make it easier to spot him.

59
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,660
Don't worry. There are other butlers besides you at that school.

60
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:39,080
Besides, you're likely to catch everyone's eye with your butler uniform.

61
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:44,070
But the bigger problem is whether we'll be in the same class or not.

62
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,930
Huh?

63
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,120
She is right.

64
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,820
What are you talking about? I'm in high school.

65
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,220
You're thirteen, so you're in middle school.

66
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,470
Oh, you didn't know?

67
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:55,930
Didn't know what?

68
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,540
I've skipped grades, so I'm in high school.

69
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,010
Milady! You're in high school?

70
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,380
Don't be that surprised.

71
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,300
But, that's like a setting from a certain 4-koma manga.

72
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,270
Don't say any more than that.

73
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,700
But it can't be true. You're so small.

74
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,180
Don't say small!

75
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,830
B-But... Seriously?

76
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,940
Damn, you're so skeptical of me.

77
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,090
Then take a look at this!

78
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:21,870
Tada!

79
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,560
W-What-

80
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,170
...a grumpy-looking picture.

81
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,180
You're not supposed to talk about that!

82
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,540
What? That really is a high school student ID!

83
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,240
I told you so from the beginning.

84
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:44,550
Hakuou has students who skipped grades, butlers, and many other people, so it is very interesting.

85
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,340
I see.

86
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:53,310
Hey, you don't believe what I say,
but you believe what Maria says instantly, eh?

87
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,490
No, I didn't mean it that way.

88
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,030
Stop making fun of me.

89
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,500
My grades are actually-

90
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,970
Then it'll be nice if we can be in the same class.

91
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,710
Y-Yeah.

92
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,200
I hope Monday comes soon.

93
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:18,020
And so, let's skip right to Monday morning.

94
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,420
I told you; there's nothing even if you come this early.

95
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,490
We're not doing this again.

96
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,200
That's my new school.

97
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,470
I know that.

98
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,150
Oh, you did?

99
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,120
You knew it already?

100
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,970
Are you all right?

101
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,950
Well, I'm glad you're happy.

102
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,440
But Milady, you're amazing to have skipped grades into high school.

103
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,940
It's not as amazing as you make it sound.

104
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,940
I'm not the only one who's skipped grades.

105
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,460
There are several every year.

106
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:08,110
And the record holder of this school's grade skipping enrolled ten years old and graduated thirteen years old.

107
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,990
Plus she was the Student Council President
for two years in a row,

108
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,680
and her grades were the best in school by far.

109
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,580
She has three silver watches given to the valedictorian of the year.

110
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:23,480
I see. So such a monster-like person does exist in this world.

111
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,750
Yes, such a monster-like person does exist, right next you.

112
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,050
Eh?

113
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,520
Oh no, did I catch a cold?

114
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,640
Anyways, in this school, students who skip grades,
transfer in, or get scholarships...

115
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,050
...have a duty to increase the school's average grade,
school ranking, and graduation rate.

116
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:50,190
On the other hand, when such students do poorly,
they can be dropped a grade.

117
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,380
R-Really?

118
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,030
Come to think of it, I remember
the Student Council members talking about that.

119
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:03,000
I was happy out of my mind that I got accepted, but it is a prestigious school.

120
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,900
Will I be fine here with my borderline grades?

121
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,060
You'll do fine, Hayate; you can do anything.

122
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,060
What's wrong, Hayate?

123
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,490
Battles are meant to be fought reading two, three moves ahead.

124
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,070
By **** *znable.

125
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,050
It's nice to wake up early once in a while; I met an interesting person.

126
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,450
Do I lose if I comment that he's the most interesting one?

127
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,540
I think so.

128
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,610
And is there a meaning to that quote?

129
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,960
Himuro, is this enough flowers?

130
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,750
Thank you, Sir Taiga.

131
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,890
Himuro thanked me!

132
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,960
Um...

133
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,250
Your outfit. You must be a butler, as well.

134
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,380
Yes. I'm a butler for the Sanzenin family, Ayasaki-

135
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,040
Sanzenin?

136
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,640
Ah, so you're that famous.

137
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,010
Then that means...

138
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,010
What a beautiful person.

139
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,900
Hey! What do you think you're doing to Hayate?

140
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:13,220
Yes, if I'm right, anyone who can make her cry and apologize can inherit the entire Sanzenin estate.

141
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,990
I won't let you touch Milady.

142
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,200
I will protect her!

143
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,660
Hayate...

144
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:26,150
To be honest, I have a meal ticket called
Sir Taiga already, so I'm not interested in it.

145
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,380
Meal ticket?

146
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,840
If you space out like that, she'll get taken away.

147
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,470
What? That's my necktie.

148
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,590
How?

149
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,280
What a foolish question.

150
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,050
Isn't it obvious?

151
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,260
Because I'm a professional butler.

152
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,990
Professional butler?

153
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:52,210
There's no joke involved when one wears a butler uniform at this school.

154
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,710
Let us go, Sir.

155
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,230
Yeah!

156
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,630
Wow! So is that the butler I aspire to be?

157
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:06,470
Although I'm not sure how that was related to work as a butler.

158
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,630
Milady! Butlers are amazing!

159
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:14,020
It's not the biggest issue, but he still has your necktie.

160
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,570
Oh no!

161
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,020
And he's gone already.

162
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:24,480
So this is how professional butlers move.

163
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,520
No, that was definitely robbery.

164
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,830
And don't make me comment on your monologue.

165
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,870
Suke-san. Kaku-san. Korashimete aganasai.

166
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,870
Korashimete aganasai. = Give them retribution.
Finishing line from the samurai show "Mito Koumon".

167
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,840
Itsude mo coffee irete ageruyo.

168
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,840
Itsude mo coffee irete ageruyo. = I'll make coffee anytime you want.

169
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,920
I'm sorry, Maria-san.

170
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,350
Really, what did you go to school for?

171
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:47,700
There.

172
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:53,300
Make sure you do not lose your necktie and go to school this time.

173
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,370
Of course! You can count on me!

174
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,240
Are you sure?

175
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,800
You're strangling me, Maria-san!

176
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,910
Hey, we'll be late!

177
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,800
I don't mind not going at all, you know.

178
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,370
Of course I'll go.

179
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,400
Have a safe trip, both of you.

180
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,780
Yes, we're off!

181
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,940
Let's go, Milady!

182
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,260
Hold on!

183
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,590
Listen up!

184
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,640
We have a new member for our class!

185
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,590
A transfer student?

186
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,860
A boy? Or is it a girl?

187
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,320
He is a boy, unfortunately.

188
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,260
Why "unfortunately"?

189
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,510
Katsura-chan, is he handsome?

190
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,590
What? Handsome?

191
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,210
I-It's making me nervous.

192
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,100
I bet he's getting nervous standing out there.

193
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:50,080
All right, then I'll make an atmosphere easy for him to enter to make up for what I did.

194
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,410
The transfer student is really cute.

195
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:01,790
It's like, cooking ****taku and **ki's DNA in ****jo, and then added Orl**** and Brad ****.

196
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,580
Just hearing his voice would knock you out.

197
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,520
The sound effect for when he looks to the side is like, BANG!

198
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,900
He's like Gol**, specialized in sniping girls.

199
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,940
And he's the Sanzenin butler and a genius!

200
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,380
His athleticism is incredible, too!

201
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,740
The Sanzenin butler?

202
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,870
And so, come on in, transfer student!

203
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,320
Hello.

204
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,260
What? Hayata-kun?

205
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,800
Didn't he fail the transfer exam?

206
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,670
A lot has happened.

207
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,000
All the eyes looking at me hurt.

208
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,970
So the handsome transfer student was Hayata-kun.

209
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,710
True, he's not ugly...

210
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:56,180
...But this is one poor-looking Orl**** and Brad ****.

211
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,220
Come and introduce yourself, Ayasaki-kun.

212
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:07,940
Even if you give me that "I've set the stage up for you" face...

213
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,100
~stare~

214
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,720
So this is what an adverse challenge is!

215
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,150
To introduce myself before a frozen cold room
as if Snow***** was just cast.

216
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:22,570
Fine. I can't let Milady feel embarrassed.

217
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:28,630
Ayasaki Hayate has always worked with adults.

218
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,810
Therefore...

219
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,800
Nice to meet you.

220
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,760
This kind of sales smile is his forte.

221
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:45,460
As Katsura-sensei has just introduced me, I am Ayasaki Hayate.

222
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:52,440
I work for Lady Nagi as her butler at the Sanzenin's.

223
00:14:53,170 --> 00:15:00,410
Katsura-sensei's introduction was a little exaggerated; I'm not that good with academics.

224
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:05,160
But I look forward to enjoying studying with you all.

225
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,860
So, I hope we get along well.

226
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,270
Now, we're even.

227
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,110
School is so much fun!

228
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,570
Yeah?

229
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,810
It isn't for you?

230
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,330
No, since there's so many people.

231
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:43,870
I prefer to be alone, to have peace and quiet,
and to spend the majority of the day on manga and games.

232
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,590
That'd make you a no-good human.

233
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:50,710
I skipped grades because I didn't want to go to school for twelve years.

234
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,240
Y-You're quite hardcore to go that far.

235
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,590
But I'm happy to be able to go to school with you.

236
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,040
It's all thanks to Maria-san.

237
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,620
And you, too, of course.

238
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:15,590
Without you setting up the transfer for me, I wouldn't be here.

239
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,290
Thank you very much, Milady.

240
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,890
Well, um... yeah...

241
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,420
I'm also happy that...

242
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,740
You like being away from people as usual, don't you?

243
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,960
Hi-Hinagiku! You!

244
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,480
Hinagiku-san. Hello.

245
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,460
Hello.

246
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,380
And what brings you here?

247
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,410
I was headed to my clubroom.

248
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,910
This is a shortcut.

249
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:47,300
Wow. So you're involved in a club
while being the Student Council President?

250
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,620
You've got to be able to handle that much at least.

251
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,460
Come to think of it, you're not in any clubs, Milady?

252
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,770
Eh? Why?

253
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:59,630
I thought the best part of school life is spending time with your friends in the same club.

254
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,070
You idiot! I don't need those anymore!

255
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,140
Oh, but your seat's still open.

256
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,500
Hinagiku!

257
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,010
What do you mean open seat?

258
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,610
She's in the same club as me.

259
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:16,630
That's bogus! I went one day to see what it's like.

260
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,320
Don't make me a member.

261
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,180
And what club is this?

262
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,320
The Kendo Club.

263
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,290
The Kendo Club?

264
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:31,760
When I entered high school, there was a time when I thought it'd be bad for me to keep being a hikikomori.

265
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:41,170
So I thought I'd start a sport during
the new student recruitment period.

266
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,090
Because it looked really cool.

267
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,520
Then why did she quit?

268
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,540
I don't know. Ask her.

269
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,810
Because...

270
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,620
Both the protectors and the sword were heavy, and I couldn't move.

271
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,450
So use a child's size, not the same as mine.

272
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,400
I'd never use a child's size!

273
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,810
Was that the only reason you quit?

274
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,460
Yeah, that was the only reason I quit.

275
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,370
Because I realized soon enough...

276
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:18,340
...that even if I did the same sport, I wouldn't be able to be like her.

277
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,130
So there was a time when Milady actively tried to pick up a sport.

278
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,520
But if I leave Milady as she is now,
she'll only become a NEET or a MMO'er.

279
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,350
I think I'd be a loser if I went to work.

280
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,370
All right, Milady.

281
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,400
Let's go check out the Kendo Club after school!

282
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,540
Wow, so this is the Kendo Club.

283
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,350
Of course. I would hate it if this was a manga or anime club.

284
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,620
But I don't see many people.

285
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,370
It's not a popular club to begin with in this school.

286
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,800
You look good in the dobog, Hinagiku-san.

287
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,760
What?

288
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,830
Ah... Why thank you.

289
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:19,000
Then why don't I introduce you to everyone and try practicing, Hayate-kun?

290
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,260
That guy just...

291
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,310
...called Katsura-san...

292
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,360
...Hinagiku!

293
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,240
A-And she said, "Hayate-kun"?!

294
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,320
But Hinagiku-san, what about my protectors?

295
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,050
You can't go without them, Hayate-kun?

296
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,950
Ah... please... Hinagiku-san...

297
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,010
Hinagiku-san...

298
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,070
Hayate-kun...

299
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,000
Hinagiku-san...

300
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,920
Hayate-kun...

301
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,750
First of all, let's get permission from the advisor.

302
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,550
Katsura-san.

303
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:42,130
There's no need to let that guy practice kendo here.

304
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,940
Azumamiya-kun.

305
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,600
Hey, butler.

306
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,830
Fight me!

307
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,700
Eh?

308
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,500
If you lose, never come here again.

309
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,170
We won't come again even if he wins.

310
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,070
Hey!

311
00:19:55,070 --> 00:20:01,650
If I lose here, Milady will probably never try kendo again, let alone any sport.

312
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,980
Then I can't afford to lose.

313
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,630
Okay, I accept your challenge.

314
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,900
Hayate-kun?

315
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,060
Flower petals?

316
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,220
This is becoming interesting.

317
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,840
Become a sword for the sake of the master.

318
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,700
Good mindset.

319
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,280
You're Prince Necktie.

320
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,010
Please give me back my necktie.

321
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,210
Thank you for the unique nickname.

322
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,400
But I don't need one.

323
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:32,190
And, I'm not sure if Azumamiya
will be good enough for the fight.

324
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,100
What?

325
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,090
Take a look.

326
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,650
H-His fighting spirit is bursting the petals.

327
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,060
Hiten-

328
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,330
Wait!

329
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,970
Don't go any further than that for copyright reasons, too!

330
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,700
But I see; looks like I don't have to hold back anything.

331
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,160
Your name was Hayate, was it?

332
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,490
Yes.

333
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:58,790
I consider you to be the person I must defeat for my, Azumamiya Koutarou's, future.

334
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:10,930
A kendo club member, Azumamiya Koutarou, declares himself to be a rival all of a sudden.

335
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,370
How strong is he?

336
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,150
The plot dives into school youth mode.

337
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,170
Heading towards the stereotypical outcome.

338
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:22,360
Next time, we'll fight against this fated rival.

339
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,070
Wait a moment!

340
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,200
Who said I will fight?

341
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,060
Nonohara!

342
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,070
Come over here, Nonohara.

343
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,490
Nonohara?

344
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,790
My butler.

345
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:35,940
Your opponent is this combat butler, Nonohara Kaede.

346
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,170
C-Combat butler?

347
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,910
Looks like next week, we'll fight against him.

348
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,260
Himuro, is that enough flowers?

349
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,950
Thank you, Sir Taiga.

350
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,790
Um, can I ask unauthorized people to leave?

351
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,790
What did he appear for?

352
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,000
Nagi and...

353
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,660
Hayate's...

354
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,730
Butler Network!

355
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,120
'Sup. It's Sanzenin Nagi.

356
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,890
It's Ayasaki Hayate.

357
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,230
And I'm Katsura Hinagiku.

358
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,100
Hinagiku-san, when did you come?

359
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,140
What? Hinagiku, what are you here for?

360
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,520
I've been put in this section for a while, too.

361
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,690
Apparently Hinagiku-san ranks number one
in a certain weekly magazine.

362
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:49,540
You're amazing.

363
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,710
Hayate-kun, you won't get anything out of me even if you praise me.

364
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,360
Excels in sports and academics.

365
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,590
I want Milady to be like that, too.

366
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,100
Hayate, time's running out!

367
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,920
What are you mad about, Milady?

368
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,680
Oh well.

369
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,550
So hello, I'm Nonohara Kaede.

370
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:06,020
I'm a butler of the Azumamiya family.

371
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,230
Go, Nonohara! Knock him out right now!

372
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,290
As you order.

373
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,300
Safety Cutter!

374
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,330
Hayate!

375
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,810
We butlers aren't our masters' tools.

376
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,870
Just doing what they tell us to do isn't everything.

377
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,130
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

378
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,640
I Won't Lose Even If I Lose.

379
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,680
Hayate, I have faith you won't lose to that butler.

380
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,380
Wipe away the tears under the mask.
