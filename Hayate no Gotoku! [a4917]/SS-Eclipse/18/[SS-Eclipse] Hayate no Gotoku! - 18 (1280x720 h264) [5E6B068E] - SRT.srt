1
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:09,370
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:09,990
Got it?

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,050
Hakuou Academy's beach class involves...

4
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,790
...traveling on a private jet.

5
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,050
Since Hinagiku is afraid of airplanes, she won't be participating.

6
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,300
But don't worry.

7
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,020
Stay tuned.

8
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,520
A butler is one who serves.

9
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,030
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

10
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:55,890
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

11
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:57,990
Yes.

12
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:06,050
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

13
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,990
What? Is it the summer vacation episode?

14
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,610
Due to scheduling issues, they swapped episodes eighteen and twenty.

15
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,380
Not many participants for a beach class.

16
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,630
Why?

17
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,120
Because the cost was through the roof.

18
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,910
It's not because we wanted to reduce production fees.

19
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,850
And this is Hayate's first airplane trip.

20
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,530
But he was in a helicopter before, wasn't he?

21
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,430
Oh, well...

22
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,510
Thank you very much, Milady.

23
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,040
It's so pretty.

24
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,270
What is?

25
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,590
The ocean of clouds.

26
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,420
Katsura-chan, come check the "kumoumi" out with us.

27
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,330
"Unkai".

28
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,090
"Unkai"?

29
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,400
Unkai = "Sea of clouds". The Student Council Trio use the wrong reading of the kanji.

30
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,400
You write "kumo" "umi", and you read it as "unkai".

31
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,240
After the vacation, I'll put it on the kanji test.

32
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,210
Unkai... Unkai...

33
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,670
Sir Taiga.

34
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,850
Sir Taiga.

35
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,880
I am thirsty.

36
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,810
W-Would cola do?

37
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,590
Yes.

38
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,840
Okay.

39
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,960
Hi-Himuro.

40
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,200
It is nice and cold.

41
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,480
Another, please.

42
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,080
Right away!

43
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,080
Nonohara, can I take a seat now?

44
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,320
Sir, didn't I tell you?

45
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,230
You did.

46
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,130
What did I say?

47
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,030
"The best way to prevent economy syndrome is to jog."

48
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:42,960
Say it again.

49
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,100
"The best way to prevent economy syndrome is to jog!"

50
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,530
Then keep running!

51
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,940
Nonohara-kun, keep it down.

52
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,740
Yes.

53
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:01,070
Milady, thank you for paying the cost for the beach class.

54
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,750
Hayate, it's better if you don't thank me for the money while you're airsick.

55
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:08,920
I'm sorry-

56
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,590
A tropical resort island with white sand that surfaces in the middle of the southern blue ocean.

57
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,270
That's Hakuou Island for you.

58
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,130
Hakuou Academy's private island for beach classes.

59
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,710
We're here.

60
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,320
Make sure you don't fall behind.

61
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,610
There!

62
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,310
Get on already.

63
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,340
To your right, you'll see-

64
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,560
I think I saw unrelated screenshots there.

65
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,720
Looks like screen capture maniacs will have to keep their eyes open this episode.

66
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:09,380
Welcome to Hakuou Academy's Hakuou Island,
reserved for beach classes.

67
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,020
Who are you?

68
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,630
Pardon me.

69
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,490
I'm the newly-appointed butler and the manager of this island, Schmidt hen Bach.

70
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,960
Call me Schmidt.

71
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,460
Ah, I see.

72
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,300
Yes.

73
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,300
I will do my best to create your fun summer memories.

74
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,590
All right, best regards to you.

75
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,970
Best regards.

76
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,070
Then let's show you your rooms.

77
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,030
Looks like we have a triple.

78
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,380
Is that because we're dumb and dumbers?

79
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,670
I don't think that's quite the case.

80
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,860
Which bed do you want, Himuro?

81
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,570
Man, that was heavy.

82
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,200
Sir.

83
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,190
It's not heavy! It's not heavy!

84
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,790
Not heavy at all!

85
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,410
You have the main room, Milady.

86
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,360
Klaus-san and I will be in the guest room.

87
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,020
I'll see you later.

88
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,650
I don't mind being in the same room.

89
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,230
Everyone change into your swimsuit.

90
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,910
Gather up in pool-wear!

91
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,200
Before we get in the ocean, we'll warm up in the pool.

92
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,640
Start stretching.

93
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,100
All right, let's get in the pool, shall we?

94
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,680
Sorry to make you all wait.

95
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,010
Schmidt! What the heck is that?!

96
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,440
Synchronized Swimming Manipulation Machine.

97
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,350
Synchronized Swimming Manipulation Machine?

98
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,020
Let's get this started.

99
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,050
*Press*

100
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,060
Zan***to Moon Attack!

101
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,600
Hey! Why is he in front of me?

102
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,570
Hey you! What do you think you're doing to Milady?

103
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,010
This is part of the attractions for creating fun memories.

104
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,450
Please watch for a while.

105
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,920
Okay...

106
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,490
Music, start!

107
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,170
Schmidt! Stop this!

108
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,430
How does this become a fun memory?

109
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,740
Hi-Himuro!

110
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,430
Don't worry about me!

111
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,510
Nonohara! H-Help me!

112
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,480
Sir!

113
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,520
I don't remember raising you to be such a weakling.

114
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,840
Y-Yes!

115
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,970
Are you all right, Milady?

116
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,330
Yeah, no problem.

117
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,350
But that Schmidt...

118
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:48,600
He said he'll make fun summer memories for us,
but he's the one having fun.

119
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,850
Yes, I think so, too.

120
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,370
Wh-What are you doing?

121
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,440
Please create a fun summer memory with your master.

122
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,000
And last is...

123
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,980
*Press*

124
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,400
Bravo. Bravo. Bravo. Bravo. Bravo.

125
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,720
Were you able to create fun memories?

126
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,760
Of course not!

127
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,430
It's noon.

128
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,980
That was the chime for lunchtime.

129
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,080
A gorgeous barbecue is set out by the beach.

130
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,460
Yay!

131
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,410
Katsura-chan, save the punch for after lunch.

132
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,210
I guess.

133
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,680
But, before that...

134
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:16,290
It's boring to eat lunch in your school swimsuit, so I prepared some nice swimsuits.

135
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,820
I'll take this.

136
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,030
I'll take this, then.

137
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,280
This I'll get this.

138
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,000
However, I'll be selecting them for you.

139
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,570
Leave the changing to me, too.

140
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,310
Lan**lot dewa arimasen!

141
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,020
He's enjoying himself.

142
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,630
He's enjoying it too much.

143
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,930
Daidai-iro tte Orenji?

144
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,930
Daidai-iro tte Orenji? = Is daidai color the same as Orange?

145
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,960
Jibun de kangaenasai.

146
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,960
Jibun de kangaenasai. = Think for yourself.

147
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,490
Segawa Izumi.

148
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,500
Hanabishi Miki.

149
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,760
Asakaze Risa.

150
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,730
Katsura Yukiji.

151
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,220
Lady Sanzenin Nagi.

152
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,300
And, Sir Oukouchi Taiga.

153
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,640
Hey now... Why is he saved for the last?

154
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,270
Besides, we've had enough of this already!

155
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,350
So, lunchtime.

156
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,200
This bikini...

157
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,370
It's very erotic.

158
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,730
Schmidt's taste is a little strange.

159
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,280
Yeah? I like mine if you ask me.

160
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:58,880
Everyone, I've prepared this so the lunch will be a fun memory.

161
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,690
Create.

162
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,880
He's up to something again.

163
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,170
No way...

164
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,030
Live alligator to feed on!

165
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,740
Obviously, it's still alive.

166
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,620
Create.

167
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:25,080
Right when Hakuou Island was echoing with screams, Isumi was...

168
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,330
...trying to go to the beach class and getting lost again.

169
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,860
*Sniff, sniff*

170
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,800
*Bark, bark*

171
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,960
Peter! Hey, come here!

172
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,750
There's someone buried here.

173
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,680
Must let the old man know.

174
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,640
Meanwhile, Hinagiku was...

175
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,130
...enjoying the vacation in the city.

176
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,290
Très Bien.

177
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,690
We're airing from Ikebukuro today.

178
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,080
Let's DC Challenge!

179
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,900
You there!

180
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,550
Me?

181
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,600
You're really good.

182
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:15,040
This program requires very skilled techniques.

183
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,480
It's challenging the limitations of the hardware.

184
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:31,420
After the rampage, the alligator returned to the wild.

185
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,350
Hayate and everyone learned the value of life.

186
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,450
Humans, alligators, corals, seagulls.

187
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:41,150
They are all precious crew members of the spaceship Earth.

188
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,590
Take care, alligator!

189
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,540
Don't ever get caught by humans!

190
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:51,040
Find a good wife and create a nice family!

191
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,410
Make sure to use your wife's house when you have family reunions!

192
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,690
So good!

193
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,200
I can't eat any more...

194
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,780
But I want to eat another one!

195
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,350
After lunch came free time.

196
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,670
All sorts of marine sports were being created.

197
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:15,720
Segawa Izumi, Hanabishi Miki,
and Asakaze Risa met the blue ocean.

198
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,930
They met it.

199
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,180
They met it, too.

200
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,700
They met it, too.

201
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:35,950
Men!

202
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,570
Island of Heat. Katsura Hinagiku.

203
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,420
Coming soon.

204
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,080
You won't go play, Milady?

205
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,640
I enjoy myself most when I'm doing this.

206
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,150
I've brought you a drink.

207
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,660
Thank you.

208
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,950
Create.

209
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,920
Merci. Create.

210
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,690
He's a good butler if he doesn't do anything.

211
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,480
Hey, this is good!

212
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,190
How do you like it?

213
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,030
"Like" what?!

214
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:57,110
We'll now go on an undersea cruise.

215
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,970
We can't see anything, though.

216
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,690
Create...

217
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,470
Don't try to change the subject.

218
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,810
It must be Diana's doing.

219
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,800
Sir?

220
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,490
Let's keep walking.

221
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,150
Yes, Milady.

222
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,750
And then it was suppertime.

223
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,010
Dinner at the hotel was gorgeous.

224
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,010
But that has nothing to do with her.

225
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,060
Tent Mura...

226
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,970
Tent Mura = Tent Village

227
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,750
Ranchuu...

228
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,520
Ranchuu = Roundfish

229
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,740
F-First kiss?!

230
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:40,040
Hakuou Academy's beach class's dinner was formal.

231
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,390
To Hakuou Academy's beach class.

232
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,750
Create!

233
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,420
Oh, you all don't seem to be enthusiatic.

234
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,660
I don't want this kind of beach class!

235
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,720
Neither do I.

236
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,490
I want to go home.

237
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,910
I don't like it, either.

238
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,880
Three stooges.

239
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,080
Three stooges?

240
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,460
Ah, sorry.

241
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,690
I agree with the three girls.

242
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,820
Schmidt, we don't want to be forced into your fun anymore.

243
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:38,430
Excuse me, but Katsura-Sensei, I'm only trying
so everyone can create fun summer memories.

244
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,260
And that effort is what's troubling us.

245
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,290
Himuro-sama.

246
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,380
Schmidt, your troubles create a negative effect on my master.

247
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,640
Nonohara-sama, you too?

248
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,350
Milady?

249
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,240
If everyone wants to go home, then I'll go home, too.

250
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,800
Then let's all head out, shall we?

251
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,010
Oh yeah, put the leftovers in some Tupperware, will ya.

252
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:57,750
I'll take it to go.

253
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,750
I won't let you.

254
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,950
Schmidt...

255
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,690
Get out of the way.

256
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,210
A summer beach class comes with a haunted house.

257
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,910
So that it'll be a part of your fun summer memories,

258
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:17,970
I've had these people come from all over the world!

259
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,690
The fun is only starting.

260
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,350
It's showtime.

261
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,680
Milady!

262
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,540
Milady!

263
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,060
Milady!

264
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,810
Milady!

265
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,760
Hayate fought for Nagi.

266
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,830
I-I'm counting on you, Nonohara!

267
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,970
Nonohara made Azumamiya fight.

268
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,730
Taiga protected Himuro.

269
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,580
Klaus sprayed insecticide.

270
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,730
You find them in shops during summer.

271
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,280
Tama... used insecticide, too.

272
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,070
Create your fun summer memories!

273
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,110
How can we?

274
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,390
Everyone, let's go home.

275
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,520
Is everyone here?

276
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,880
Yes.

277
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:42,020
What a horrible beach class.

278
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,500
It is Hakuou Academy, after all.

279
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:51,200
Hey, Katsura-chan, this plane's flying over mountains.

280
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,730
It's not headed to Hakuou Academy?

281
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,380
Hey, where are we headed to?

282
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,980
If you don't like the beach class, I'll create a mountain class.

283
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,640
Schmidt?

284
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,360
Where are they headed to now?

285
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,320
Next time, we'll fight against summer memories.

286
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,260
Hello, this is Maria.

287
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:24,440
Our guests today are Aizawa Sakuya-san's butlers,
Makita-san and Kunieda-san.

288
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,070
I'm Makita.

289
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,830
I'm Kunieda.

290
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,800
We haven't seen you two in the show for a while, but what do you usually do over the weekends?

291
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,950
I bought a guitar a while back.

292
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,070
I can play E fine.

293
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,090
But F is...

294
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,440
By the way, I'm Makita.

295
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,070
Clean the room, I guess.

296
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,910
Oh, but when I finish, I tend to start reading books.

297
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:44,780
By the way, I'm Kunieda.

298
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,020
I see.

299
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,710
Thank you very much for coming today.

300
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,180
See you next week.

301
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,030
Nagi and...

302
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:31,770
Hayate's...

303
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,260
Butler Network!

304
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,500
What's up, yo? I'm Sanzenin Nagi.

305
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,260
I'm Ayasaki Hayate.

306
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,700
What? We're back to your song?

307
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:44,240
According to a ranking, my song placed higher than Hinagiku's, but I'm pushing it again just to be on the safe side.

308
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,170
I see...

309
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:48,870
Now is the time to prove who
the heroine of Hayate no Gotoku is!

310
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,300
That's the Milady I know.

311
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,540
Your stubbornness is increasing.

312
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:58,280
Hayate. In Sanzenin Nagi's dictionary, the word "lose" does not exist.

313
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,430
Bye bye.

314
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,780
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku...

315
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,060
Saki's been acting strangely recently.

316
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,020
Looks like she's worried about something.

317
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,860
Saki-san's going to her
Coming-of-Age Ceremony next year, huh?

318
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,970
By the way, what was your
Coming-of-Age Ceremony like, Maria-san?

319
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,660
I'm still a fresh seventeen year old.

320
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,400
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

321
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,670
Saki-san's Personal Business (National Ver.) 2007

322
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,940
Come to think of it, nobody celebrated my birthday.

323
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,910
I don't mind it though, really.

324
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,550
Let's get ready with Hayate next week, too!

325
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,410
RELEASE!
