1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:09,350
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,050
Got it?

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,930
Looks like it'll be a hot day.

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,270
Milady, good morning.

5
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,840
Yup. And I'm off to school.

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,240
Yes. Then allow me to accompany you.

7
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,780
What?!

8
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,360
What's gotten into you, Milady?

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,960
How are you possibly up so early on your own?

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,240
And you're actively going to school?

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,430
Rather than that, summer vacation starts today.

12
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,420
Just kidding.

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,140
Did I surprise you?

14
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,160
That was a joke.

15
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,510
A joke?

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,000
Oh, I see.

17
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,870
It's summer vacation! I can't possibly waste time in bed!

18
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,770
I'll play MMOs and watch anime and draw manga and fool around to my heart's content!

19
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,210
I think you do those even on school days.

20
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,020
But to be so exuberant about it, you must be really happy.

21
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,130
I'll be able to spend the entire day with Hayate from now on.

22
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,600
A butler is one who serves.

23
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,380
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

24
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:41,940
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

25
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,210
Yes.

26
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:52,050
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

27
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,860
I thought I had just started my school life, and it's summer vacation already?

28
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,660
Other than saying hello to classmates and the fight in the Kendo Club, did I do anything else?

29
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,420
I love summer vacation!

30
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,740
I can drink all the booze I want!

31
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,150
Plus, I can do this all I want, too!

32
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,810
Doing nothing is the ultimate luxury!

33
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,050
Katsura-chan.

34
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,220
Let's play.

35
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,960
What are you guys? Grade school kids from the 1950's?

36
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,360
We figured you'd be bored, so we came to invite you out.

37
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,610
I'm sorry, but I'm busy right now.

38
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,380
Let's go catch beetles.

39
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,820
How about wandering through the forests around Mt. Fuji?

40
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,040
Hey, what's this about? Let go of me!

41
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,980
Um, Maria-san. Do you have
an ultimate attack or anything like that?

42
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,620
Um, what is this out of the blue?

43
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,750
Well, I met those who I take to be
professional butlers at Hakuou Academy,

44
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:44,340
but according to them, professional butlers are to have an ultimate attack or two.

45
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,060
I see.

46
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,730
So I'm thinking of learning one, too.

47
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,470
I see why now.

48
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,600
But why do you ask me?

49
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,110
"Why?"

50
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,250
This is just my guess, but...

51
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,570
...you look like you can use the art of assassination.

52
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,950
I can't.

53
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,310
But my instincts tell me-

54
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,720
Please trash such useless instincts right now.

55
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,120
What? You can use it, can't you?

56
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,460
Nagi... Even you...

57
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,670
I thought you could at least use Gotenshou Bakushinken.

58
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,460
Right?

59
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,060
Yes.

60
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,140
Please. Do not make me become a fighter with manic skills.

61
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,270
Besides, ultimate attacks aren't easy to learn.

62
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:34,240
I agree, but since it's summer vacation, I'd like to master one.

63
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,920
It'd be nice if there was a book that I could learn one from.

64
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,420
A book, you say?

65
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,400
As expected from the Sanzenin's book vault.

66
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,850
It's an amazing collection.

67
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,300
That's why cleaning this place is real work.

68
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,910
But books are nice.

69
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:00,410
Indulging in reading surrounded by books makes you feel intelligent.

70
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,910
I see. Well said, Milady.

71
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,040
And I guess these are the shelves reserved for Milady.

72
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,250
How did you know?

73
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,380
Well...

74
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,920
This place is filled with manga.

75
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,200
H-Hey, I read books other than manga, too!

76
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,900
Of course, I know.

77
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,060
I see so many walkthroughs for games, too.

78
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,430
Listen!

79
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,570
Reading books does make you feel intelligent, doesn't it?

80
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,700
Stop making fun of me!

81
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,900
I can't find it.

82
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:33,000
I can't understand why you're so attached to ultimate attacks.

83
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,870
I can understand it.

84
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:42,720
I'm sure he's trying to show his good side for me.

85
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:51,590
With my elegant attack, I will protect you, Milady.

86
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,060
You're amazing, Hayate.

87
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,230
What is the matter?

88
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,590
N-Nothing.

89
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,260
All right, Hayate, I'll help you, too.

90
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,540
I'll search for the book that might help you
come up with an ultimate attack with you.

91
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,710
Thank you very much, Milady.

92
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,710
Seriously... Ultimate attacks?

93
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,120
It's not like there's a correspondence course for karate.

94
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,860
You can't possibly find a book that'll teach you one.

95
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,360
You just might find one.

96
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,010
Ultimate Attacks 4 Dummies! Includes colored charts!

97
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,830
Who knew such a useful book slept here?

98
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,760
Really.

99
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,200
But what's this "Sanzenin Secret Techniques"?

100
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,690
Oh, I remember Himegami-kun using it.

101
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:40,950
Himegami-san?

102
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,310
Um, I hear his name on occasion, but...

103
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,520
Oh, we haven't told you about him?

104
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,720
He was Nagi's butler before you came.

105
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,620
Well, a lot happened and he left us.

106
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:58,350
I see. And that Himegami-san also had an ultimate attack.

107
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,760
Which means, could Klaus-san possibly have one, too?

108
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,830
Are you interested in my ultimate attack?

109
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,890
No, not right now.

110
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,570
Stop fooling around and get back to work.

111
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,080
Anyway, there's nothing you can't do that other butlers can.

112
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,250
Milady!

113
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,590
Hayate, let's begin the training!

114
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,030
Yes, Master!

115
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:30,960
I'll do my best!

116
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,110
Don't call me "Master"!

117
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,420
Call me "Undefeated in the Four Directions and the Center"!

118
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,460
That's a little too long...

119
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,730
Silence.

120
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,100
Follow me.

121
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,600
Are you all right?

122
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,160
I scratched my knee a little.

123
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,460
What an unreliable "Undefeated in the
Four Directions and the Center" legend.

124
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,580
It's really hot.

125
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,330
Milady, wouldn't it be better for you to stay inside in a cool room?

126
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,980
No, this is for your ultimate attack's sake!

127
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,790
Let's get this started.

128
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,260
Yes, please begin.

129
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,820
We'll start with the basics.

130
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,460
Yes.

131
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,900
Case 1.

132
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,430
Ultimate attacks for those who were once burned by their enemies.

133
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,030
Let's see...

134
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:21,810
Um, isn't there an ultimate attack that can be used before being burned by the enemy?

135
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,690
I don't see anything like that.

136
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,910
I don't think I can handle such over-the-top moves right off the bat.

137
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,690
Why don't you give it a try, Tama?

138
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,360
First, you must have a body that won't even burn in fire, like a ruler of the millennium.

139
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,860
The prerequisite is wrong.

140
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,310
But if you can't do this, you can't do Case 2, ultimate attacks when pushed off a cliff.

141
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,640
Like I said, let's do something before I'm pushed off.

142
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:47,970
Then...

143
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,960
What's wrong, Milady?

144
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,520
N-N-N-Nothing.

145
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,210
It's nothing.

146
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,130
I-I never imagined such a skill would be in here.

147
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,100
But...

148
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,460
...I'd love to master this!

149
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,710
So master it.

150
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,960
Milady?

151
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,890
W-W-What?

152
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:11,900
I want to read it through to see if there's anything useful written in it, so may I borrow that book?

153
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,980
No! I refuse! I reject!

154
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,330
W-Why?

155
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,410
It's too early for you.

156
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,430
What?

157
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,010
I want to see it.

158
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,530
Anyway, when I say I can't show it to you, I can't show it to you!

159
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,650
Milady, it's dangerous that way!

160
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,640
Milady!

161
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,470
So, how do we become lovey-dovey?

162
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,030
Are you a moron?!

163
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,030
The prerequisite is wrong!

164
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,270
Milady! In front of you! In front!

165
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,160
If I could do something this embarrassing-

166
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,460
Milady!

167
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,270
Hayate.

168
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,680
Hey, Hayate. Are you alive?

169
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,990
Are you all right, Milady?

170
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,300
Yeah, I'm...

171
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,610
Thank goodness.

172
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,580
I'm glad I was able to save you.

173
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,490
Right, even without relying on
an ultimate move, Hayate and I are...

174
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,060
Thank you.

175
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:26,130
Hey, this book is almost entirely useless, but there are
some moves that use chi and several more practical ones, too.

176
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,870
Really?

177
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,800
Yeah. With effort, you should be able to master these.

178
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,990
Yes.

179
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:36,470
All right, I'll master an ultimate move over the summer!

180
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,260
Yup.

181
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,480
I must work hard for Hinagiku-san's sake, too.

182
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,450
Yup, you're right, for Hinagiku's sake, too-

183
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,360
Wait.

184
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,450
For whose sake did you say?

185
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,180
Hinagiku-san has been helping me a lot, so...

186
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,790
And I promised her I'd show it to her when I master an ultimate attack.

187
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,030
Promised?

188
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,360
I see...

189
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,800
No, the skill book!

190
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,360
Why did you do such a thing, Milady?

191
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,270
Ha-Ha-Hayate...

192
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,590
Hayate, you jerk!

193
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,850
Maria-san.

194
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,180
Oh my! What's wrong?

195
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,950
Would you teach me the ultimate move to calm Milady down?

196
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,720
That'll require a lot of training.

197
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,380
It'll be a while before Hayate learns an ultimate move.

198
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,960
Therefore, please keep watching Hayate no Gotoku!

199
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,840
Suika no tane. Pe!

200
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,840
Suika no tane. Pe! = Watermelon seeds. *Spit*!

201
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,810
Pero-san faito!

202
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,810
Pero-san faito! = Pero-san, fight!

203
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,280
What?

204
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,980
Milady ran out of the house?

205
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,120
Yes. The SPs are after her,
so there's nothing to worry so much about, but...

206
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,450
But I'm still worried.

207
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:58,400
Things she does are always spur of the moment; I can't always tell what their reasons are.

208
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,560
I wonder what happened to her.

209
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,460
I am sure the reason is you, Hayate-kun.

210
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:10,230
Okay, as her butler, I must chase her and discover the reason.

211
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,500
Damn it, Hayate.

212
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,280
What's this "for Hinagiku's sake" about?

213
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,370
Does he care about Hinagiku more than me?

214
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,030
What if...

215
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,410
What if Hayate comes to like Hinagiku more than me?

216
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,020
No, you can't. You mustn't, Hayate-kun.

217
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,760
You already have Nagi.

218
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,900
What are you saying, Hinagiku-san?

219
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,460
You're the only person I can think of as my destined one.

220
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,600
Hayate-kun...

221
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,820
Hinagiku-san...

222
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:47,790
Screw you! Stupid, Hayate!

223
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,720
What's so good about Hinagiku?

224
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,270
Hinagiku's only a little cute.

225
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,580
She's kind-hearted and smart.

226
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,470
Plus she's athletic and everyone trusts her.

227
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,350
Even I aspire to be like her a little.

228
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,690
Hmm.

229
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,120
Our breasts are about the same size.

230
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,560
What did you say?!

231
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,900
And my grades are no worse than hers!

232
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,990
Even though the summer break's started, I don't feel cheerful at all.

233
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,210
I wonder what Hayate-kun's doing now.

234
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:18,910
Rather than that...

235
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,290
Why was Hayate-kun at such a gorgeous mansion?

236
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:25,850
And...

237
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,940
Who was that girl?

238
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,170
I have so many things I want to talk to and ask Hayate-kun about when I meet him.

239
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,410
Seriously!

240
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,160
Let's just go home and go to bed.

241
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:39,880
Hey.

242
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,220
Besides, Hayate is the one to be blamed for everything!

243
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,130
You!

244
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,850
Hey, you're the burglar hamster from sometime ago.

245
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,340
Who are you calling a burglar hamster?

246
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,450
Then a trespassing hamster.

247
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,950
Lockpicking hamster.

248
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,380
Could you at least take the "hamster" off?

249
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,080
Anyways, it's the fated reunion.

250
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,350
I finally caught up, but...

251
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,110
Um...

252
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,050
Why is Milady with Nishizawa-san?

253
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,470
First of all, is there a meaning to this camouflage?

254
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,260
I thought it'd be better to have one rather than not.

255
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,780
By the way, Hayate-kun, I wanted to ask earlier,

256
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,220
but what is your relationship with that Nishizawa-san?

257
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,180
Ah, well...

258
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,450
I love you, Hayate-kun!

259
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,150
W-We're friends.

260
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,250
She was my classmate at my old school.

261
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,680
I see.

262
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,510
I wonder what they could be talking about.

263
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,590
I bet it is about you.

264
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,040
What? You're the owner of that mansion,

265
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,070
and you took in Hayate-kun when he was lost in the streets,

266
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,610
and now he's employed as your butler and living under the same roof?!

267
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,570
Yeah, you got a problem with that?

268
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,390
I'm so enviou-

269
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,590
No, I mean, what a sense of defeat.

270
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,750
You're so mean, God.

271
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,410
This is so unfair.

272
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,330
See ya, Hamster.

273
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,650
Don't ever come near our property.

274
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,210
Hold on!

275
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,940
If I step away now, I'll only be a miserable loser.

276
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,200
And my pride won't allow that.

277
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,140
Fight me!

278
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,220
A face off between us with Hayate-kun as the prize!

279
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,500
Sure. I'm conveniently in a bad mood.

280
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,170
I'll send you home.

281
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,470
What is this place?

282
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,610
It's a karaoke box, obviously.

283
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,630
You've never been to one?

284
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,450
So this is?

285
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,430
It's my first time coming to a strange place like this.

286
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,730
But, wow, this place is smaller than our bathroom.

287
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,560
What?

288
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,400
If you stay in a dark, small room like this for hours,

289
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,250
even if you're not the son of the Mendou family, you'll become nyctophobic and claustrophobic.

290
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,190
Anyway, let's order our drinks and start the fight.

291
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,800
What do you want for your drink?

292
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,730
I don't mind paying if it's only one.

293
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,570
Totally unimpressive.

294
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,080
Then Shiun green tea and Périgord foie gras terrine.

295
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,880
I-I don't think they have those here.

296
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:18,050
I don't really get it, but looks like they're going to karaoke.

297
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,820
What should we do, Maria-san?

298
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,240
Maria-san?

299
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,950
I-I-I'm sorry.

300
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,970
I rented this box for now, so let's go in.

301
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:27,630
Yes.

302
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:34,530
But why did Nishizawa-san bring Milady here?

303
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,960
Hayate-kun, Hayate-kun!

304
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,470
Yes?

305
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,710
Wh-What is this device for?

306
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:43,800
You punch the number in to request a song.

307
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,980
So that's how this works.

308
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,560
Wow, you can even adjust the pitch.

309
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,980
You can search using this book, too?

310
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,410
Wow, it's so thick.

311
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,050
Um, since we're here, would you like to sing?

312
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,060
What are you saying, Hayate-kun?

313
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,820
I can't. I do not know any pop songs.

314
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,960
Besides, I'm worried about Nagi.

315
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:11,300
Don't worry. We can see their room from here.

316
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,440
And I'd like to hear you sing, too.

317
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,880
But...

318
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,850
Then if you sing first, I guess I'll try one song.

319
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:23,010
Okay, then I'll take the first song.

320
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:43,240
Kimama ni mau kaze no gotoku.

321
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:46,640
Yay!

322
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,720
So what's the score?

323
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,410
Tada!

324
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,650
35%?

325
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,120
Why?

326
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,430
Obviously, it's because you missed so many notes.

327
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,930
Then, you're up next.

328
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:02,810
Sure.

329
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:10,270
A girl who's come to karaoke for the first time ever can't possibly sing well.

330
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:15,690
I sang that one as a warm up,
but if I sing seriously, I'll win for sure.

331
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:19,870
Watch me, Hayate-kun. I'll save you with my song.

332
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,180
Hayaku koi!

333
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,180
Hurry and come here!

334
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,390
Chotto okotteruzo

335
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,390
I'm a little mad

336
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,310
What?

337
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,400
Hayaku koi!

338
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,400
Hurry and come here!

339
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,520
Mahha kousoku dazo?

340
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,520
Mach high speed, you here?

341
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,940
What is this bright radiance coming out of her?

342
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,000
Hikikomori nichiyoubi.

343
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,000
Hikikomori Sunday.

344
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,980
She looks like Tsukishima ***-chan to me.

345
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,380
Suguni tone konakucha

346
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,380
You have to come running to me

347
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,620
Forget that, she's really good!

348
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,470
Dame~

349
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,470
Or else it's a no-no!

350
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,350
Tonikaku dame dame.

351
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,350
It's a no-no.

352
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,670
Obviously.

353
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:45,870
It's because she's had special lessons from when she was little,

354
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,220
Dame~

355
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,220
No-no~

356
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:50,840
and her courses included voice and song training by professionals.

357
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,500
Hayaku konai kana?

358
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,500
Will he be here soon?

359
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,250
You may have forgotten, but Nagi is a hyper-rich girl.

360
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:01,480
Even if this may be her first karaoke experience, she won't lose to an average high school girl.

361
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,890
Looks like the match's settled.

362
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,230
No! The match's only begun!

363
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,330
Songs require love!

364
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,610
I won't lose!

365
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,930
Fine, then I'll floor you!

366
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,840
On to next round!

367
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,970
The two's battle heated up.

368
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,980
Bring it on!

369
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,060
The battle lasted late into the night, and finally...

370
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,830
Singing a lot made me feel better.

371
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,710
I ended up losing every song.

372
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,980
Hey, do you want to use my card to pay?

373
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,770
Forget it! I'll pay this much!

374
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,020
I don't want to be in debt to my rival.

375
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,030
Rival?

376
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:39,550
Isn't rival a word used when your levels are close to equal?

377
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,490
We've come to pick you up, Milady.

378
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,380
Ah, thanks. How did you know I was here?

379
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,550
We received a call from your butler.

380
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,700
From Hayate?

381
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,060
I see.

382
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,670
See you, Hamster.

383
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,770
Hold on!

384
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,670
Next time, we'll fight with something else, do you hear?

385
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,090
Come anytime you want.

386
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,960
I'll shut you down again.

387
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:14,120
All right, let's go home and play some games with Hayate.

388
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,580
The summer vacation has only begun.

389
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,820
Meanwhile, the maid and butler were...

390
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,530
Usotsuite mo omitooshi desu.

391
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,530
I can see through all your lies.

392
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,790
Watashino me ha fushiana jyanai

393
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,790
My eyes aren't blind.

394
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,400
Maria-san, how about we call it a night?

395
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,890
...still singing.

396
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,540
Romansu futarini-

397
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,540
Romance come to the two-

398
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,060
The end of the first day of summer vacation.

399
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,960
What should we do tomorrow?

400
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,970
You guys aren't planning to stay here the entire summer, are you?

401
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:41,020
They enjoyed their first day, too.

402
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,150
By the way,

403
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,620
Book report and English essay, complete.

404
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,210
there is approximately one diligent student.

405
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,030
Kids watching this, plan ahead in regards your homework.

406
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:54,390
Next week, we'll fight against height limits.

407
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,670
Isumi's...

408
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:33,420
Butler Network!

409
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,120
Hello, I'm Saginomiya Isumi.

410
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:44,210
Um, I couldn't make it in time for the actual show,
but I was put in this section.

411
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,720
Um... What am I supposed to talk about?

412
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,530
What? Talk about this song?

413
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,430
Um... This song is...

414
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:58,800
Hey, Isumi. If you talk so slowly, you'll run out of time.

415
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,750
Nagi-

416
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,570
Ah-

417
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,750
Butler uniforms aren't the best on you, after all.

418
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,060
What? Are you cross-dressing me again?

419
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:08,410
No, I don't think those clothes are suitable for going to the amusement park.

420
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:09,260
Amusement park?

421
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:14,130
With this new body,
the debt-ridden butler is no longer my enemy!

422
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,100
You robot there! What company's spy are you?

423
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,860
Makimura-san, even you?

424
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,340
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

425
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,770
Even Peter-san Has Had Enough.

426
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,780
Why does that robot look familiar?

427
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,280
The power of justice calls the storm!
