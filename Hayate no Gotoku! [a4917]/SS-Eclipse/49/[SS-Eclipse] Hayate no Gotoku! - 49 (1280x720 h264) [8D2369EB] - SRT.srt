1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,950
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,120
Spring's right around the corner.

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,660
The third semester flew by, didn't it?

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,810
Yeah? It felt like it took forever to me.

5
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:27,210
But the only days you came to school were when we thought Katsura-sensei was quitting and last episode.

6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:34,340
I'm the main heroine, so when the story takes place at Hakuou, I have no choice but to show up.

7
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,230
There you go mumbling nonsense again.

8
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,860
Let's go home, Hayate.

9
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,700
Seriously, why is school such a big pain?

10
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,590
But then, it'd be a different story if this were Hou**ka Academy or Ku***.

11
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,160
Oh, I would like to try the Ashi**do Academy's uniform once.

12
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,780
Milady's hatred of school is really over the top.

13
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,360
Why, why. Who do we have here?

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,620
If it isn't Hayata-kun and Nagi-chan.

15
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,130
What a coincidence.

16
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:06,860
How may I help you all?

17
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,790
We thought we'd take part in our club activity for once.

18
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,960
Club?

19
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,930
Oh, I always assumed that none of you were involved in any clubs.

20
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,040
Are you interested, Hayata-kun?

21
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,800
What?!

22
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,730
No, not really.

23
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,280
What? "I'd love to participate", you said?

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,200
Then stop by our club room.

25
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,800
Come, come.

26
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,540
H-Hey!

27
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,980
Just as planned.

28
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:40,770
Did you all know that there's a huge mansion like this in the middle of Tokyo?

29
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,920
The name of the mistress who lives there is Sanzenin Nagi.

30
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,720
And...

31
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,080
Her butler's name is Ayasaki Hayate.

32
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,890
The two are slightly airheaded...

33
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,270
...and they misunderstand each other a bit...

34
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:57,470
...but they are bound by a tight master-butler bond.

35
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:03,130
This story takes place when hu**** were still able to fly.

36
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,440
Motion Picture Research Club?

37
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,720
You really have a unique club room.

38
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,970
The building is made according to the club founder's taste.

39
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,500
This is a 16mm film!

40
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,540
This is a super HARP camera!

41
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,550
I got it. You're basically a MC!

42
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,820
A Movie Club!

43
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,120
What are you talking about...

44
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,060
...Little bunny?

45
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,260
It isn't?

46
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,270
We don't have any intention of shooting movies.

47
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,330
We can't do anything that difficult.

48
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,930
Then what do you do here?

49
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,680
That's obvious!

50
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:22,270
We film and gather all sorts of funny movies and laugh at them with everyone!

51
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,110
That's why we're also called Niko **** Movie Club.

52
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,540
In short-

53
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,780
You-To-be~

54
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,490
"In short?"

55
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,070
So basically a boredom killing club.

56
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,240
Who are you calling the boredom killing club?!

57
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,890
Motion Picture Research Club, huh?

58
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,820
It sounds a little interesting.

59
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,340
Wh-What's this? Milady has an interest in getting involved with people.

60
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,200
I think she's interested in the motion pictures.

61
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,760
Speaking of it, Nagi-chan, are you in any clubs?

62
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,570
I'm not in any right now.

63
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,910
Then give this one a try.

64
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:00,120
We're a really lax club originally made to take shots of cute girls.

65
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,570
So it'll work as a way of making memories.

66
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,480
What should I do...

67
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,050
This is a chance.

68
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:12,590
It's a great opportunity for Milady, who tends to be a hikikomori, to enjoy regular school life.

69
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,690
Who would ever call me a butler if I don't support her being in it?!

70
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,200
Okay.

71
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,940
Wow, it sounds very interesting!

72
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:24,090
So, what kind of footage do you actually shoot?

73
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,820
The works are lying around there.

74
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,620
Then let me see some.

75
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,380
You said you shoot footage of cute girls, right?

76
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,520
Hello, I'm Ayasaki Hayako.

77
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,390
A little mischievous sixteen year old.

78
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,930
Some nice-looking men out there take me out on dates!

79
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,820
No! There goes our work!

80
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,430
What was that spy shot about?!

81
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,910
You even dubbed over it!

82
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,620
What's wrong? It's funny.

83
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,320
By the way, cameras are set everywhere.

84
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,730
From the pinnacle of Chomolungma to Shi**ka-chan's shower room over at Minamoto-san's.

85
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,300
No, you can't film! Stop!

86
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,280
Then how about this?

87
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,140
Sensei! I... I can't hold myself back anymore!

88
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:27,120
Y-You can't, Ayasaki-kun. We're student and teacher.

89
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,730
But I want to stay like this with you.

90
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,640
You fool. Don't trouble me like that.

91
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,600
Being able to cheat is a sign that a guy's dependable.

92
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,650
Girls are around for you.

93
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,860
You're making me look like the biggest flirt in the world!

94
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,050
Hey, Hayate. What was all of that about?

95
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,730
Th-They're accidents! They were all purely accidents!

96
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,220
Milady.

97
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,890
Let's take our leave now.

98
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,520
What? You're going to leave, Hayata-kun?

99
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,270
You just got here.

100
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,970
I don't want to see any other sketchy footage.

101
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,490
Don't say that.

102
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,100
Please, help us.

103
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,610
Help? What do you mean?

104
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,320
You all seem to be having fun.

105
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,440
Superintendent!

106
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,890
Wh-What brings you here?

107
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,710
Today's club investigation day run personally	by Kuzuha-sama!

108
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,530
Investigation?

109
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:35,450
I'm checking to make sure nothing has strayed from what students should be doing.

110
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,730
Exactly.

111
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,630
So she does some normal stuff once in a while.

112
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,540
Don't be deceived, Hayata-kun.

113
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,140
How could she be normal?

114
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,580
Do you have any clue how much suffering stems from her investigations?

115
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,050
For example, in the Tennis Club.

116
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,060
No one can hit a Boomerang S***e here?

117
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,960
Closed down.

118
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,290
In the American Football Club-

119
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,640
They can't even do a ***bat Dive in midair?

120
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,650
Closed down.

121
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,750
Furthermore, in the Doll Club-

122
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,480
"To wind or not to wind?"

123
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,930
It doesn't run on *****?

124
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:14,800
Closed down.

125
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,510
Like that, there are countless clubs that got destroyed.

126
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,970
I don't want us to be closed down.

127
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:28,460
That's why we were planning on getting you into our club as one of the Superintendent's favorite men on campus...

128
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:34,820
...and show her footage of how much economical adversity you're in.

129
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,630
And yet...

130
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:41,040
I don't think the Superintendent would have enjoyed watching that.

131
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:46,340
Wh-What? This was Ayasaki Hayate's embarrassing moment collection?

132
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:46,760
Yeah.

133
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,570
I wanted to see them!

134
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,300
I so wanted to see them!

135
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,310
Kuzuha-sama.

136
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,630
Okay. I order the Motion Picture Research Club closed down this instant.

137
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:03,760
Starting tomorrow, start the Onono Imoko Research Club or the Eat Udon up the Nose Research Club.

138
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,670
Can't it be a little more normal club?

139
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,510
What a waste. We were just about to start shooting amazing footage.

140
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,170
What? Amazing footage?

141
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,370
We were planning on showing it to you, too.

142
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,570
What exactly will it be like?

143
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,760
Staff credit NG collection!

144
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,660
Staff credit?

145
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,540
You've seen them in Jac*** **** movies.

146
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,710
In those staff credits, they play NG shots, remember?

147
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,770
That stuff.

148
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,220
"That" you say, but...

149
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,470
I see.

150
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,520
I do like them.

151
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,510
I don't mind Jac*** **** either.

152
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,670
Oh my. Milady is showing interest in something that's not 2D.

153
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,500
As her butler, I must do this.

154
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,870
Hey.

155
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,200
This is your only chance to stop.

156
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,140
Good luck, Hayate!

157
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,460
This is amazing.

158
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,970
I can't miss a frame of this.

159
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,880
I really think he should stop.

160
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,600
Ready, everyone?!

161
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,110
You will, Jac***?

162
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,390
Jump, Jac***!

163
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,870
Meanwhile...

164
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,640
Makimura-san, you can't take footage like this.

165
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,740
I said you can't!

166
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:36,360
I never imagined I'd find film this old.

167
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,690
In this networked world, it's hard to recall movies that once got distributed.

168
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:41,850
Watch out.

169
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,820
Su-Sukinan dakara, mou.

170
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,820
Su-Sukinan dakara, mou. = Y-You really like this kind of stuff.

171
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:52,110
Ureshinakijya, boke!

172
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,800
Ureshinakijya, boke! = We're crying because we're happy, you idiot!

173
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,930
Hakuou Academy Motion Picture Research Club. The First...

174
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,800
...Exciting...

175
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,770
...Normal Story Competition!

176
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,710
What is this out of the blue?

177
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,710
What are you asking? It's obviously...

178
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,850
...Just as the title reads!

179
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,550
The Motion Picture Research Club must consider safety first.

180
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:13,640
We decided to reflect upon our acts and take footage that can be enjoyed by everyone in front of the screen.

181
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,740
Yay.

182
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,360
Uh...

183
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,010
I won't let you say you're leaving after coming this far.

184
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,440
We already have a contract with the Superintendent that
if we present her with funny footage featuring Hayata-kun,

185
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,580
then she'll give us 30% more funding next term.

186
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,300
When did you do that?

187
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:32,350
Plus, Nagi-chan agreed to help as a club member.

188
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,910
What's wrong?

189
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:38,150
Anyway, what is this Normal Story Competition?

190
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,410
Thank you for asking, Nagi-pon.

191
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,130
You see, Nagi-rin...

192
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,350
...This is how it goes, Nagi Springfield.

193
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,250
Um, can you just call me Nagi like normal?

194
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,150
This was back when I was in elementary school.

195
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,660
Excuse me...

196
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,550
I was at a really rundown fishing village.

197
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,320
That village seemed as though time had stopped.

198
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:08,960
It was pretty creepy at first, but at the inn we stayed at, a really worn out statue of Ninomiya Kinjirou stood facing the ocean.

199
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,900
From what the landlady of the inn said...

200
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:16,810
At night, that statue turns around to make sure no kids staying at this inn are staying up late.

201
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,790
So you mustn't stay up too late, okay?

202
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,270
Yeah, I've heard those kinds of stories before.

203
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:27,300
I see. So we're going to gather those common stories.

204
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,670
No!

205
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,360
The story continues.

206
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,190
When you hear something like that, you have to confirm it, right?

207
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,820
At night, we snuck out with a few kids to check.

208
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,620
The time was 2 AM.

209
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,880
Looking back, we really shouldn't have.

210
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,830
It was pitch dark out.

211
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:51,720
It was a windy night, too, with a sound like human groaning.

212
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,340
We waited for ten minutes, then twenty minutes.

213
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,920
It was summer, yet it was strangely chilly.

214
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,130
The next moment, we couldn't believe what we saw!

215
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,490
We had all fallen asleep at some point, and morning had come.

216
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,900
Whatever happened to the statue of Kinjirou?

217
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,480
Everyone was asleep, so no one confirmed it.

218
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,900
You used seventeen cuts for that worthless story?!

219
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:22,540
Just like that we collect normal stories where nothing happens that can't be used in any kind of context...

220
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:27,560
...and want to make a collection of footage that makes viewers feel, "Ah, that was a waste of time."

221
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,420
We don't need a collection like that.

222
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,520
However, all humans have one or two worthless stories like that.

223
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,480
Come on. I know you have one, too.

224
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,130
A really worthless story that you have sealed away.

225
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,590
Well. Um, I...

226
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:51,250
I used to live in a really crappy house as a kid.

227
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,980
You do have one to share?

228
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,190
That house was really crappy.

229
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:59,720
At night, the windows would always rattle.

230
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,660
One night, I was staying at home alone.

231
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,820
At the time, we didn't have electricity, so it was pitch dark inside.

232
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,880
I tried to go to bed, curled up in my futon,

233
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,530
but I realized something.

234
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,130
"Hey, the rattling noise is louder than usual."

235
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,950
I was scared, but as though I was drawn by something, I walked towards the window.

236
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:28,270
I slowly opened the curtain,
and took a look outside the window,

237
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,050
and I noticed that...

238
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,160
...the wind was stronger than usual.

239
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,390
So what?!

240
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,890
Nothing happened.

241
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,190
But that's exactly what we're looking for.

242
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,220
Good job, Hayata-kun. You know how things go.

243
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,230
Thank you.

244
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,540
Yes, yes, yes! I want to tell my story, too!

245
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,220
Katsura-sensei! Where did you come from?

246
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,540
At noon, I leave the POD room, right?

247
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,500
One day after work, I felt this
the moment I stepped into the room:

248
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,750
"Something's not right."

249
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,340
At first glance, the room hadn't changed.

250
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:11,220
But I could tell that something important was gone.

251
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,490
I thoroughly checked the room.

252
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,680
Then I finally realized what I was missing.

253
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,130
I was missing...

254
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,050
Missing what?

255
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,040
...cash from my wallet!

256
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,140
What the heck was that?!

257
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:32,150
I'm 500,000,000% sure it's because you used it all.

258
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,440
Hey, where's the mike?

259
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,490
If I may, can you listen to my story, as well?

260
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,620
Klaus-san?

261
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,920
This is school, you know?

262
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,460
At this point, I'll enter any possible scenes given the opportunity.

263
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,050
So.

264
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:51,260
At the Sanzenin's, we used to have a dog named Lucky out in the yard.

265
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,860
Oh yeah, we did have a dumb dog like that, didn't we?

266
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:01,260
He was indeed a dumb dog, but by around six in the evening, he'd always be back and be sleeping in his place.

267
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,050
But one day, he didn't come back even after the sun was starting to set.

268
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,900
We didn't have him on a leash,
but it didn't look like he had left the premises.

269
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:12,400
But, no matter how dumb he's been, it was hard to think that he could get lost in his own yard.

270
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,930
I searched for Lucky the entire night.

271
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,890
But I couldn't find him, and a day passed.

272
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,680
A second day went by, as well...

273
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,810
...but Lucky wouldn't come back.

274
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,460
However, on the third day!

275
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,380
Lucky was back in his home!

276
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,470
Wh-Why?

277
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,670
That was the end of this story.

278
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,920
Thank you for being a good audience.

279
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,970
What happened during Lucky's three days?

280
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,750
I wouldn't know.

281
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,760
Push.

282
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,360
Can I tell my story, too?

283
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:56,260
When we were cleaning our house,
Kotetsu-kun found a really old wooden box.

284
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:01,150
Inside the box was a mummified Kappa's hand.

285
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,800
And on the inside back of the box was some scripture.

286
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,240
It said that this hand will grant any three wishes of the owner.

287
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,200
So, did you make your wishes?

288
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,270
No, I bet there was a fearsome curse instead.

289
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,060
Well, you see...

290
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,230
We ended up...

291
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,380
...tossing it out as noncombustible trash the next day.

292
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,920
Hey, wouldn't a Kappa's hand be combustible?

293
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,790
She's right. It's combustible.

294
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,230
Oh, it is? Oopsies.

295
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,700
It's now become a story about trash...

296
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,260
Right, I'm up next.

297
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,000
Do you all know the word "doppelganger"?

298
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:41,710
It's about meeting an individual who's like a copy of yourself.

299
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,780
It's said whoever sees a doppelganger will soon die after that.

300
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,200
It's said that Lincoln saw one the day before he was assassinated, too.

301
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,430
A Japanese poet, Murou Saisei, also saw a doppelganger.

302
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,650
This time, it's starting to sound like an urban legend.

303
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,700
Doesn't the name Murou Saisei sound just like Slow Saisei?

304
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,700
Note: Slow Saisei = The slow play setting on video players

305
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,170
Also, toudai motogurashi and
taishou democracy sounds similar, too.

306
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,850
Plus, Jura*** Park and Ju**ke ni nisanpaku sounds similar, too.

307
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,940
Those really are things no one cares about.

308
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:18,770
It's all up to you to believe it or not.

309
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:19,910
Um...

310
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,890
May I share my story from home?

311
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:25,940
Saki-san.

312
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,090
My home is really old, and whenever someone uses the stairwell, it makes creaking noises.

313
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:39,580
One day, the whole family was eating on the first floor, but we heard the creaking noise from the stairs.

314
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:45,370
So Mom said, "Wow, our house must really be getting old", and so we renovated.

315
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,550
That really was a normal story.

316
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:53,030
My god. Those were all really boring stories.

317
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,070
Wataru-kun?

318
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,180
Oh, if it isn't him; you're...

319
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,850
President! Our club president!

320
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,090
President?

321
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,600
Yup, that's right.

322
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,090
The boy standing there is the current
Motion Picture Research Club's president,

323
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,640
Tachibana Wataru-kun!

324
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,180
Tada.

325
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,550
You just forced me to be the president.

326
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,330
When did this happen?

327
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,280
Just so you know, the president's amazing.

328
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,000
He makes MAD anime openings that could fool the eyes of people who don't watch anime.

329
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,970
Note: A MAD movie is a Japanese fan-made video, much like AMVs (Anime Music Videos)

330
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,520
Also, all the OreVoice series are made by him!

331
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,460
No, they're making that up.

332
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,620
Besides, come on. None of them have any punch lines.

333
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,300
As expected of our President.

334
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,640
Then what, you can tell a story with a punch line?

335
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,390
I don't know.

336
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:42,290
But what I'm saying is, I want to hear a more touching normal story that strikes one's heart.

337
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,840
"A normal story that strikes one's heart?"

338
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,590
Yeah, for example.

339
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,170
This is regarding outer space.

340
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:53,510
You know how space is expanding at great speed, right?

341
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,570
Y-Yes.

342
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:00,230
Also, you know that light is the fastest thing in the universe, right?

343
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,030
Well, since it's common sense.

344
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:06,520
However, the rate of expansion is greater the further you are from Earth.

345
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,980
Therefore, the stars further away from Earth will distance themselves from Earth more quickly,

346
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,500
and eventually, they will go past the speed of light!

347
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,300
Why?!

348
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,660
It's a mystery, isn't it?

349
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,460
P-President...

350
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,510
Was that the end?

351
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,480
So that ends one worthless day.

352
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,590
I wonder if anything good happens.

353
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,270
A p-peach?!

354
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,300
Why?

355
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,620
Th-This is...

356
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,360
I can't reach it!

357
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,100
Oh yeah, I know what I can do.

358
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,740
I'll go buy a can of peaches.

359
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,770
Ring ring. Ring ring.

360
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,400
There was another normal story for you.

361
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,120
Next week, we'll fight against quiz tournaments.

362
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,610
Right now, we are in front of Yukiji's room.

363
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,850
Let's go check out her sleeping face.

364
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,750
Oh, but before we do that...

365
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,410
All those who are watching Hayate no Gotoku.

366
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:21,370
This will probably be the last episode where we'll be featured as main characters.

367
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:25,110
Looking back, there was this and that and many things that happened.

368
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,730
I feel a little sentimental.

369
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,900
But an ending is a start of a new ending that will lead to a beginning.

370
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,770
Let us meet again somewhere.

371
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:34,830
Ready?

372
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,300
Bye bye!

373
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,210
Come, come and wake me up already!

374
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,290
Hey! Hey!

375
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:43,700
You can easily play my wake up reaction
300,000 times and get 100,000 comments!

376
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,820
I did it!

377
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,660
You're kidding me!

378
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:30,820
Nagi and,

379
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:31,810
Hayate and,

380
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,060
Maria, a seventeen years-old's

381
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,580
Butler Network!

382
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,580
You idiot! I'm Sanzenin Nagi!

383
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,640
I'm Ayasaki Hayate.

384
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,980
I'm Maria, a seventeen year-old.

385
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,520
The cold days continue, but are you all doing well?

386
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,870
On a cold day like this, it's better to stay inside
and play MMOs rather than to force oneself outside.

387
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,940
If you say things like that, you won't get to master your life like Maria-san.

388
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,430
Oh please, Hayate-kun. But remember, I'm only a YEAR older than you.

389
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,140
I'm sorry, Maria-san. But you're very mature, and some times appear like an ol-

390
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,230
Time for today's service shot.

391
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,670
Please keep supporting Hayate no Gotoku.

392
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:02,750
Shine! Jump! Shake you booty.

393
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:06,680
The 4256th High School Girl Ultra Quiz!

394
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,750
Your host will be me, Mikiri Teruo and,

395
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,800
Abe Maou ~tima.

396
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,040
There are tens of thousands of pairs that have gathered from all over the country ~tima.

397
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,640
Who will be victorious?

398
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,780
Can't wait ~tima.

399
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,740
Next time: Quiz! Written as "Rival" and Read as "Friend"!!

400
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,490
Why do I have to pair up with the Hamster?

401
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,380
Next time, strike your special pose as you watch Hayate no Gotoku.

402
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,280
Bring it on!
