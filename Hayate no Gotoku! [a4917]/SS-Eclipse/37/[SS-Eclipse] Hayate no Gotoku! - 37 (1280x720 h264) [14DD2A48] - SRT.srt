1
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,300
When watching TV,

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,750
make sure the room is well lit,

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,970
and watch from a distance.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:09,920
Got it?

5
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,670
Where am I?

6
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,340
You're finally up!

7
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,530
It's after nine already.

8
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,220
Go wash your face.

9
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,320
Breakfast is ready.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,920
That's right. I slept over at the Hamster's last night.

11
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,010
Yeah, that's right.

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,210
Don't go back to sleep!

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,870
Hey, what are you doing?!

14
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,930
If you don't get up already, you'll suffer.

15
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,630
Is this where you like it?

16
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,350
Stop it!

17
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,970
Get up!

18
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,440
One who masters being a butler becomes the master of the world.

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,110
The Butler War that shakes the planet has started!

20
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,780
Hey, Hayate, it's me.

21
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,790
Yeah, I'll be heading home now.

22
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,650
WHAT?!?!

23
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,850
What's the matter, Milady?

24
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,670
Huh?

25
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,930
Hayate!

26
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,900
Yes!

27
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,210
What type of girl do you like?

28
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,180
Huh?

29
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,890
I-It's not that I'm doubting your feelings.

30
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,380
But, how do I put it...

31
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,100
I wanted to double check just in case.

32
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,770
Love fortune for Sagittarius...

33
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,690
What are you thinking, reading over my shoulders?

34
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,760
"A sense of crisis between couples."

35
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,870
"Your partner might be getting tired of your selfishness."

36
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,900
"Listen to his preferences, too."

37
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,640
Is that what caught your attention?

38
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,200
Maria!

39
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,230
Geez!

40
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,050
Answer me, Hayate!

41
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,590
What kind of girl is your type?!

42
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,530
Let's see...

43
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,600
What is the picture of your ideal married life?

44
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,050
Between food, bath, and me, which comes first?

45
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,500
How many kids do you want?

46
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,540
Please don't bombard me with questions.

47
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,060
Why can't you answer?!

48
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,480
I won't forgive you if you hide anything from me!

49
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,780
Oh, please don't!

50
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,030
You'll get tired if she speaks like that, right, Hayate-kun?

51
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,020
No, that's not true.

52
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,420
Let's see...

53
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,250
My ideal type would be...

54
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,200
Would be?

55
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,660
I guess a normal girl.

56
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,180
Eh? Normal?

57
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:10,820
Yes.

58
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,450
I think being normal is very important.

59
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,940
I wish I could be married to a normal person and have a normal family,

60
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:21,050
without worrying about a 150 million yen debt from parents or getting involved with the very kind people.

61
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,430
That's my little dream.

62
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,300
Normal?

63
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,320
I think your life until now was way beyond what could be called normal, Hayate-kun.

64
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,470
Normal...

65
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,850
I'm sure it's something you wouldn't understand, Milady.

66
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,970
What did you just say?

67
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,640
I said, "It's something you wouldn't understa-"

68
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,020
You fool!

69
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,360
Nagi!

70
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,260
Did I say something to upset her?

71
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,370
Yes. But I'm sure you wouldn't understand.

72
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,280
Don't make fun of me!

73
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,680
Is he saying that I can't become his ideal figure?

74
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,220
All right, then...

75
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,520
Eh?!

76
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,150
Milady left the house again?

77
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,190
Yes. The SPs called in a few minutes ago.

78
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:19,320
That's no good. What could the reason be this time?

79
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,670
The reason is always you, though, Hayate-kun.

80
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,810
Welcome.

81
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,120
Come on over.

82
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,930
Will I get to acquire "normal" if I hang around here?

83
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,220
But, this is a little...

84
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,710
No, get your act together, Sanzenin Nagi!

85
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,710
I must master the art of normalcy and match Hayate's ideal figure!

86
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,830
Until then, I will not return home!

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,380
Now, bring it on, normal!

88
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,600
Your opponent is me!

89
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,920
Wow, the normal appeared!

90
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,730
Huh?

91
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,090
It's here!

92
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,660
Normal is here!

93
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,480
What are you doing here, Sanzenin-chan?

94
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,720
Nishizawa Ayumu.

95
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:13,870
The one and only normal life form in Hayate no Gotoku who exudes normalcy in any kind of condition.

96
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,330
What's that supposed to mean?!

97
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,790
I'm sorry for being normal!

98
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,350
Yeah, really.

99
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,920
It's a problem for you, of all people, to be normal.

100
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,490
What nonsense are you spouting?

101
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,090
Besides, what are you doing here, Hamster?

102
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,200
Where I am is none of your business.

103
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,400
And will you stop calling me Hamster?

104
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:41,580
Oh yeah. If I observe her, I might be able to learn normal.

105
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,040
God, that girl.

106
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,650
*stare*

107
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,840
Hey, why are you following me?

108
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,000
Is there a problem if someone follows you?

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,350
Yes! Since I'm about to go shopping!

110
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,930
Perfect! I wanted to see what normal shopping is like.

111
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,900
Wh-Why does it turn out like that?

112
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,440
So this is a station.

113
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,680
I know. This is where you get on and off trains, right?

114
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,480
I've seen them in mangas, but I never knew they really existed.

115
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,350
Oh boy. Is she really going to follow me?

116
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,350
Here we go!

117
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,780
It's bullying me!

118
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,030
I'm being bullied by the station!

119
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,460
I'm against bullying!

120
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,420
Just because I'm not normal!

121
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,070
I'm against racism.

122
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,620
You can go through if you pay.

123
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:52,410
Geez, why do I have to buy your ticket?

124
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:55,120
So now I finally get to ride a train!

125
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,460
You pervert!

126
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,660
It's impossible.

127
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,200
Eh?

128
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,550
I can't get on that.

129
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,120
Eh?

130
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,100
Do normal people always jump on when it's moving at that speed?

131
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,710
Huh?

132
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,410
That one is called a limited express.

133
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,300
Local lines will come, too.

134
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,930
What? So that one wasn't normal?

135
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,040
Oh, okay.

136
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,720
Wow!

137
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,660
Look! The outside view is flying away sideways.

138
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,630
Hey, where's the driver's seat?

139
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,250
I want to drive this, too.

140
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:41,930
Eh?

141
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,830
You can't do that!

142
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,590
It's not a video game.

143
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,400
Oh, you can't?

144
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,450
I'm good at train simulators.

145
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,270
Hey.

146
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,340
What's wrong?

147
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,040
Everyone's sitting on my seat without permission.

148
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,920
Huh?

149
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:09,110
Of course they are! This isn't reserved for us.

150
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,840
Eh?! It isn't?

151
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,560
No way! You didn't even know that?

152
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,400
Oh my god. It's normally common sense.

153
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,540
Stop bragging about being normal!

154
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,370
You know, it's been bugging me,
but why are you so hung up on normal?

155
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,120
It's none of your business!

156
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,160
You say that after following me?

157
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,710
Hurry!

158
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,010
What? We're going to walk that much?

159
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,670
Yup. It's a shop about 500 meters in.

160
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:58,430
Why didn't you go all the way there on the train?

161
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,150
Don't be ridiculous!

162
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,760
What is this?

163
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,920
Lots of people are waiting.

164
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,670
I'll take three.

165
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,330
Excuse me.

166
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:08,860
Yes.

167
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,660
Can I still buy Koyuki's Special Seafood Cake?

168
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,910
Yes, you can.

169
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,020
Yay, I'm so lucky!

170
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,510
Is this the famous "line"?

171
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:21,870
One that appears whenever new games or limited goods for an anime are released?

172
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,320
Yup. It's a really popular cake and only fifty are sold per day.

173
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,880
Today, my parents and little brother are away on a trip, so I'll have it all to myself.

174
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,750
I won't give any to you.

175
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:35,980
I don't need it.

176
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,190
Normal people want really boring things, don't they?

177
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,790
I won't give it to you even if you beg!

178
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,350
Hey, it isn't moving at all.

179
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,580
Patience, patience.

180
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,330
Things taste so much better if you go through the process of waiting.

181
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,340
What?

182
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,640
Where did she go?

183
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,640
Hey, Hamster!

184
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,210
Come over here.

185
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,510
What are you doing now?!

186
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:05,010
Be happy! I was able to buy this shop's limited stuff without lining up.

187
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:05,830
Huh?

188
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,510
Thank you for your business.

189
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,840
XPS 360 made of 18 karat gold. Limited production of three.

190
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,450
It'll be five million yen.

191
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,940
W-We don't need it!

192
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,860
Zenbu kure!

193
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,860
Zenbu kure! = Give me everything!

194
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,830
Rerere no Oji-san da.

195
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,830
Rerere no Oji-san da = I'm the rerere Oji-san.

196
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,500
What?

197
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,750
H-Hayate-kun. Do you want to take a photo sticker with me?

198
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,800
She finally said it.

199
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,180
Ayumu, fight!

200
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,240
But I have a job to go to right now.

201
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,070
It'll be over in a second. As a memory. Okay?

202
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,550
Memory of what?

203
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,020
Um...

204
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,020
Of going to your job?

205
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,940
Huh?

206
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,930
Anyways, let's go! Just once!

207
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,020
Nishizawa-san!

208
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,060
There goes the limited cake.

209
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,340
Don't be so disappointed.

210
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,220
Whose fault was it?

211
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,820
I was only able to get the leftover cream puffs.

212
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,760
That's what you get for trying to do things differently from usual.

213
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,570
I tried to learn what normal is,
and you're not being a good reference at all.

214
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,130
Why do you only say such nasty comments?

215
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,140
I've had enough. I'll have people from your place come get you.

216
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,700
Tell me your phone number.

217
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,970
What is that?!

218
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,280
Hey! Don't look at other people's photo stickers!

219
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,840
I won't forgive you!

220
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,880
When did you take such a thing with Hayate?

221
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,980
*smirk*

222
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,170
Are you envious?

223
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:00,090
This is a keepsake photo sticker between Hayate-kun and me.

224
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,460
I have something, too...

225
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,920
Look! I have Hayate registered as 001 in my phone book!

226
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,860
What, you have your own cell phone?

227
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,910
I won't tell you his number.

228
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,010
Jealous, aren't you?

229
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,280
I'm a little jealous.

230
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,720
Let me take the opportunity to make this clear.

231
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,980
Hayate belongs to me!

232
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,040
Eh?!

233
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:31,530
Even if you might be a world record holder of super normal, this will never change.

234
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:38,530
Yeah? I bet he'll get tired of selfish girls and leave your side soon enough.

235
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,280
I won't follow you anymore!

236
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,270
So disappear already!

237
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,530
Wh-Who do you think you are?

238
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,680
You were only bothering me from the beginning.

239
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,120
Come on.

240
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,070
I'll walk you home.

241
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,660
Leave me alone!

242
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,960
Listen to what I say a little.

243
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,270
Ow.

244
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,980
You're covered in blisters.

245
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,360
It's because you walked a lot when you're not used to it.

246
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,480
I told you to forget about me.

247
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,570
It'd be best for you to call and have someone from your home come pick you up.

248
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:27,100
I'm not going home until I master normal!

249
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,480
Then do you want to come to my place?

250
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,500
My home is around here.

251
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,860
Like I said earlier, there's no one home right now, so I don't mind you coming over.

252
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,210
Fine. If you insist so much, then I will.

253
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,000
Good grief, you're so stubborn.

254
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,420
Here they are.

255
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,180
Here's yours.

256
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,900
Th-Thank you.

257
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,030
It's good, isn't it?

258
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,420
I'm sorry about earlier.

259
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,460
You couldn't buy the cake because of me.

260
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,680
This is little unexpected.

261
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:29,310
So you can say "thank you" and "I'm sorry".

262
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,820
D-Don't make fun of me.

263
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,880
Of course I can.

264
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,520
Hey, this is good.

265
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,710
Isn't it?

266
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,540
It costs 200 yen per puff, you know?

267
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,840
Oh, it's that cheap?

268
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,710
And how do you live in this small room?

269
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,880
I now understand what figurines feel like when they're placed in showcases.

270
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,240
I-Is that what you should be saying after eating someone else's cream puffs?

271
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,420
Okay, I want you to serve me dinner next.

272
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,690
Keep serving me normally.

273
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,350
She hasn't learned anything.

274
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,450
So this is what a normal dinner is like.

275
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,520
It's frozen food.

276
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,350
Watch out!

277
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,660
I get it.

278
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:25,190
Normal is just an extremely
scaled down version of what I usually do.

279
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,720
I see.

280
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:43,970
If you weren't super-rich, you'd be a normal girl.

281
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,130
I would?

282
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,320
A normal girl?

283
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,200
Yeah. Since you're stubborn and a sore loser.

284
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,730
What did you call me?

285
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:53,740
How you get worked up when it's about the person you like.

286
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,330
But that's what's cute.

287
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,290
You're a normal girl.

288
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,050
That's right! I'm a normal girl!

289
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,180
That Hayate doesn't understand anything!

290
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,400
Hayate-kun doesn't?

291
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,490
So that's why you were so hung up on normal.

292
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,720
Exactly.

293
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,290
I see. So Hayate-kun likes normal girls.

294
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,750
I won't lose, do you hear?

295
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,260
Eh?

296
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,050
No matter what kind of history you may have with Hayate,

297
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,200
that single picture won't do anything against our bond!

298
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,610
Picture? You mean the photo sticker?

299
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:43,600
Oh, come on. There isn't any deep meaning behind it.

300
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,630
Oh. That was an episode without any surprise or drama.

301
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,610
You don't stand on the pinnacle of normalcy for nothing.

302
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:57,420
The way you say it really hurts.

303
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,250
It's a compliment, so be happy.

304
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,890
This is my room.

305
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,380
Go ahead and use that bed. I'll be sleeping in the living room.

306
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,600
Good night.

307
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,080
H-H-Hey!

308
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,960
Um, ah...

309
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,870
I don't mind sleeping with you, you know?

310
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,890
I thought you might be scared sleeping alone.

311
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,180
I really don't mind, you know?

312
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,970
Then let's sleep together, shall we?

313
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,410
Yeah!

314
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,400
And...

315
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,990
Tell Hayate that I'll be sleeping over here tonight.

316
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,110
Just this once, got it?

317
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,840
O-Okay.

318
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,470
H-Hayate-kun?

319
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,430
It's me, Nishizawa Ayumu.

320
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,900
Um, ah...

321
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,310
Yeah, it's been a while.

322
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,440
Wait!

323
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,070
D-D-Don't turn it off.

324
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,350
Okay. Good night, Sanzenin-chan.

325
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,550
Just call me Nagi.

326
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,480
Goodnight, Nagi-chan.

327
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,110
Goodnight, Hamster.

328
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:21,310
This is how the girls' night quietly ended.

329
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:25,270
Next week will be the climax of the butler battles.

330
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:28,450
We'll fight and fight and fight and fight to the ends of the Earth!

331
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,660
Really?

332
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:38,980
Okay. Then please take care of Milady, Nishizawa-san.

333
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:47,640
Why is Hayate here almost in the middle of nowhere when he's had almost no screen time this week?

334
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,300
Actually, he was around.

335
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,940
See here?

336
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,910
And here, too.

337
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,920
And even here.

338
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,080
Can you get a move on?

339
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,240
I'm sorry.

340
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,230
He stalks Lady Nagi to make sure she's safe.

341
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,580
I take that back. He was following her.

342
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,840
Looks like I don't have to go help them out.

343
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,880
Hayate-sama!

344
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,580
Over here, Hayate-sama!

345
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,710
Isumi-san?

346
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,280
How did you end up there?

347
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:46,320
I got lost while taking a walk in my garden,
and I found myself up here before I noticed.

348
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,600
Please hang in there. I'll be there right away.

349
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,830
Please hurry, Hayate-sama.

350
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,780
Don't panic, Isumi-san.

351
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,130
Hang in there, Isumi!

352
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,800
Wataru-kun?

353
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,780
Sir! It's dangerous to climb up such a place!

354
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,370
I'm coming up to save you.

355
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,790
I'm almost there, Isumi!

356
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,950
Wataru-kun.

357
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,320
Isumi!

358
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,180
You pervert debt-ridden butler.

359
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,470
Hey, why did I have to fall, too?!

360
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:34,630
And where's your jab at me asking where I came from?!

361
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,020
Are you all right, Isumi?

362
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,630
Hayate-sama really is so dependable.

363
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:47,630
And so, it was the debt-ridden butler that was doing the most work behind the scenes.

364
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:52,210
And that concludes the time-filler using minor characters.

365
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,830
Why is this happening?

366
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,190
Wataru and,

367
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:31,830
Saki's...

368
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,820
Butler Network!

369
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,560
Hey. I'm Tachibana Wataru.

370
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,840
I'm Kijima Saki.

371
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,960
Sir, the sales promotion goods we were talking about last time...

372
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:45,780
How do signed photographs of the tiny store manager sound?

373
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,040
Saki! When did you take a picture like this?!

374
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,390
It's my payback for last week.

375
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,120
And so, Rental Video Tachibana is a fun store filled with smiles.

376
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,020
Please stop by if you happen to be nearby.

377
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,680
Aye! Mystery!

378
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,590
Looks like it's not snowing this year.

379
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,590
So it's been a whole year since that day.

380
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,160
Yes. Time flies.

381
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,930
I'm the butler who has been reborn to fight you!

382
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:12,930
Take this!

383
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,130
You're...

384
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,550
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

385
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,990
Preview of the final episode, part one.

386
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,340
Hayate in Danger! Complete Shut Down!!

387
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,810
Right now, you have lost your powers as a butler.

388
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:24,530
Because of the curse cast by
the Superintendent of Hakuou Academy.

389
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:28,150
Did you know? "Cyborg" is
a shortening of "cybernetic organism".
