1
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,990
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,630
Boyfriend?!

3
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,970
M-Mom, what's this all of a sudden?

4
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,320
Don't scare me.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,540
But you're starting to reach the best days of your life.

6
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:30,640
I thought you'd like to spend
your birthday with someone you like.

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,710
It's got nothing to do with that!

8
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,840
Besides, I don't have anyone like that.

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,950
Oh, you don't?

10
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,330
Plus, we had decided to spend my birthday as a family.

11
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,520
It's been ten years since then, huh?

12
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,510
What? What's this?

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,620
You were so small, and look at how mature you've become.

14
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,100
Time flies.

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,120
S-Stop that. You're embarrassing me!

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,890
Boys won't leave a girl this cute alone.

17
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:15,710
I'm sure there's a wonderful boy out there who will come dashing to you if you call.

18
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,060
Someone who'll come if I call, huh?

19
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,830
Wh-Why is Hayate-kun coming to mind here?

20
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,230
Yes, he is a kind person, and I don't dislike him...

21
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,580
But he's nothing special!

22
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,860
Did you all know that there's a huge mansion like this in the middle of Tokyo?

23
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,990
The name of the mistress who lives there is Sanzenin Nagi.

24
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,760
And...

25
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,080
Her butler's name is Ayasaki Hayate.

26
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,880
The two are slightly airheaded...

27
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,260
...and they misunderstand each other a bit...

28
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:06,110
...but they are bound by a tight master-butler bond.

29
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,010
No! I swear it's not like that!

30
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,880
Good morning, Hinagiku-san.

31
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,210
G-Good morning!

32
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,010
Hinagiku-san?

33
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,240
What happened to Hinagiku?

34
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,260
Could I possibly have done something to make her mad at me again?

35
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,960
Hey, pull yourself together. Why are you depressed before even taking your exams?

36
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,880
Ah, right. Today is  the day of the final exam, isn't it?

37
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,280
Then what were you just depressed over?

38
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,910
Oh, nothing.

39
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,770
Geez. Because Mom said something like that last night, I ended up being anxious around him.

40
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,470
Th-This is...

41
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,030
No name.

42
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,130
Who could it be from?

43
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,380
Someone's got some courage to send me a love letter.

44
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,870
Could it be from Hayate-kun?

45
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,460
No, it can't be!

46
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,610
But he did say hello when we ran into each other.

47
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,790
Wh-What could it say?

48
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,890
I'll be waiting in front of the Kendo Dojo after school.

49
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,330
Please come.

50
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,060
What are you doing, Hayate?

51
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,930
N-N-Nothing! It's nothing.

52
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,460
If it's the Kendo Dojo, could this be from Hinagiku-san?

53
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,900
No, calm down, Hayate.

54
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,850
A youth love story event like this can't really be happening to you.

55
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,520
Besides, were there any events that made my rating with her increase?

56
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,440
Or wait! Was this morning's strange attitude because of this?

57
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,530
Here, Milady.

58
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,660
Thank you.

59
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,400
Stop, stop. If I fail this, then I'll have nothing left.

60
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,600
I must concentrate.

61
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:59,740
Like that, the final exam ended covered with pink-colored distress and H-game-like imaginations.

62
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,040
And now it's after school.

63
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,210
What?! This is wrong, as well?

64
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:09,990
God, I taught you that multiple times. How foolish can you be?

65
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,200
Crap, what should I do?

66
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,230
Nagi, you don't need to check Hayate-sama's answers?

67
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,170
No need for that. Hayate can do anything when he tries.

68
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,480
Right, Hayate?

69
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,240
O-Of course, Milady.

70
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,270
Honestly, because of this, I couldn't concentrate much.

71
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,620
But for now, I guess it's time for a study session for those who can't get it even when they try.

72
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,410
Who are you calling "those who can't get it even when they try"?

73
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,150
I'm not going over to your house!

74
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,930
Oh, what a waste. I was thinking of doing it at Isumi's place.

75
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:39,410
What?

76
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,890
A-At Isumi's place?

77
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:45,120
Sure. Let's all study together.

78
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,890
I-If you say so, then I guess I can come.

79
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,690
So, Hayate. Sorry, but can you head back to the mansion first?

80
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,590
Okay.

81
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,250
I've got some free time now.

82
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,840
I guess I'll go for the heck of it.

83
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,780
But I'm sure Hinagiku-san won't be the one waiting.

84
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,960
Um... Was there a Legendary Tree-like tree
in front of the Kendo Dojo?

85
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,770
And why a sakura tree in March?

86
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,450
Plus, the Legendary Tree isn't a sakura.

87
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,400
Forget about all those minor issues!

88
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,830
H-Hinagiku-san!

89
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,270
H-Hayate-kun.

90
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,820
Why are you here, Hinagiku-san?

91
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,760
Wh-Why? W-Well... because I'm here for my club activity, of course.

92
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,260
Why are you here, Hayate-kun?

93
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,120
Um, then could you be...

94
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,850
Could you be...

95
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,760
...the sender of this letter?

96
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,600
I've been waiting for you, Ayasaki!

97
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,490
You're mystery kendo club member A!

98
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,000
Who are you calling the kendo club member A?!

99
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,790
Don't treat me like a background character!

100
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,080
What are you doing here, Azumamiya-kun?

101
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:23,230
Katsura-san! Today, I shall defeat our enemy Ayasaki before your very eyes and show you my true ability!

102
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,410
Then, you sent me this letter?

103
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,500
How could you end it like this...

104
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,470
What's wrong, Ayasaki? Giving up once you found out that you have to face me?

105
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,440
What exactly is with this lovely challenge letter?

106
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,190
What kind of background character are you to write a heart in a challenge letter?

107
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,040
Don't call me a background character!

108
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,380
My name is-

109
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,430
I'm aware.

110
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,100
You showed up in episode 15 and declared your rivalry to me...

111
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,340
...but got beaten within seconds by Hinagiku-san in episode 16...

112
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,930
...and haven't gotten much screen time ever since.

113
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,230
In the popularity vote taken at Akiba,
you were ranked lower than Hata-sensei's mother.

114
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,850
Right, Azumamiya Koutarou-san?

115
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,050
Yes, you're right!

116
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,980
But forget all of that explanation!

117
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,860
Hayate-kun. Did you perhaps think that I wrote that letter?

118
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,310
Ah, no! Absolutely not!

119
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,650
Oh please. Why would I think that?

120
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,170
Hinagiku-san would never do something so girly.

121
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,900
What do you mean by that?

122
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,110
What did you mean when you said
I would never do something so girly?

123
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,410
It didn't have any deep meaning.

124
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,080
Then tell me what you meant.

125
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,730
Did I make her angry again?

126
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,440
Looks like even Katsura-san despises you.

127
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,650
Serves you right.

128
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,390
You don't have to worry about me. Why not deal with him?

129
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,490
Hina- Hinagiku-san?

130
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,210
You hear that, Ayasaki?

131
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:47,000
Even Katsura-san wants to see me beat you gallantly.

132
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,470
I ask of you a favor, too.

133
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:53,670
As his butler, I request that you have a match with him.

134
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,410
For the past two and a half seasons, he's fought through hard training.

135
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,170
And he finally opened his mind's eye for beating you!

136
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,900
All that so he can fight me?

137
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,000
Exactly.

138
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:20,380
It's very rare for the loser Azumamiya to come make a challenge on his own.

139
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,810
Wouldn't turning him down tarnish your manhood?

140
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,160
Y-You might have a point.

141
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:34,340
Plus, if you turn it down, I'll have to forward the bill for the flowers that's supposed to go from the Azumamiyas to the Sanzenins.

142
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,610
Himuro. Do I need to keep going?

143
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,500
Keep it up, Sir Taiga. It'll be over soon.

144
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,040
Okay, fine. I will fight you, Azumamiya-san.

145
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,940
I'll do my best for you, Himuro.

146
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,930
That's what I like to hear, Ayasaki!

147
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,340
A secret technique he came up with just to defeat me.

148
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,970
What sort could it be?

149
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,520
Ready?

150
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,370
He threw away his shinai?

151
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,600
He's going to fight with his fists?

152
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,810
The secret technique I came up with...

153
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,380
It's this!

154
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,650
Huh?

155
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,610
My turn!

156
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,690
Come on!

157
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,000
Um, what is this about?

158
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,360
Can't you tell by looking at it? It's a cat's cradle battle!

159
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:22,860
Huh?

160
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:27,480
The secret technique Sir came up with after two and a half seasons.

161
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:36,110
It goes, "There's no chance of winning in kendo. Then I shall beat him in something I'm best at!"

162
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,690
Indeed, that's the Azumamiya boy.

163
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,770
What a loser choice.

164
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,570
You're such a Nob***-kun.

165
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,500
Well, Ayasaki? Giving up already?

166
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,390
Fine. I did accept your challenge.

167
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,090
Zo*** Genesis. Mur***** Liger!

168
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,800
What the heck is that?!

169
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,070
How did you even make that?

170
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,530
Nothing is impossible for butlers.

171
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,550
W-Why you...

172
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,960
I-I lost...

173
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:14,240
I just wasted thousands of pieces of yarn that I wore out for this day.

174
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,560
What kind of training did you do?

175
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,180
Sir!

176
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,240
Nonohara...

177
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,320
It's pitiful for you to give up after only one loss.

178
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,190
I've always taught you to keep rising with an adamant attitude until you win if you're a man!

179
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,540
That's right! I can't give up just because I lost once!

180
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,370
So you understand me.

181
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,970
Therefore...

182
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,670
Fight me, Oukouchi Taiga!

183
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,360
That's right, Sir.

184
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,820
How sharp of you to pick a fight with someone you have the best chance of winning against!

185
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,220
Hi-Himuro!

186
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,070
Interesting.

187
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,800
I don't want you to underestimate
our Sir Taiga's ability, Nonohara-kun.

188
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,570
Why are you taking it there?!

189
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,560
Um, may I go home now?

190
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,090
No one's listening to me.

191
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,700
Oh yeah, where did Hinagiku-san go?

192
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,340
God, God, God!

193
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,120
Why did I hope that the letter was from Hayate-kun?

194
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,730
It pisses me off!

195
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,500
It almost feels like I got dumped,
when I wasn't necessarily in love with him.

196
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,680
Wow, youth is so nice.

197
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:37,820
End of that. We'll forget about
Azumamiya vs Taiga and continue to the second half.

198
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,870
Ganbattan dakedo damedatta!

199
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,870
Ganbattan dakedo damedatta! = I tried my best but couldn't!

200
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,810
Tarutaru monku suishou shimasu.

201
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,810
Tarutaru monku suishou shimasu. = I recommend Tarutaru Monku.

202
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,450
It's no good. Why can't I concentrate on studying?

203
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,490
When you're feeling irritated,
it's best to go out to the city and change the mood.

204
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,590
Hey, what do you want for your birthday?

205
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:14,290
As long as Gin-tan's with me, I don't need anything else.

206
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:19,890
Yeah. After all, spending a birthday with your sweetheart and being all excited about it is the best.

207
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:24,280
Right, right. Spending a birthday alone is so lame.

208
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,640
Yeah, yeah. Just rub it in.

209
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,450
Who cares. It's got nothing to do with me.

210
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,320
If you're with your sweetheart or not for your birthday...

211
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,600
H-Hinagiku-san.

212
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,590
Hayate-kun.

213
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,670
What are you doing here?

214
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,650
I wanted to get another reference book.

215
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,110
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

216
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,340
Wh-Why are you apologizing all of a sudden?

217
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,180
I'm not really sure myself.

218
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,340
It looks like I made you angry yesterday, too.

219
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,390
Are you really reflecting on your acts?

220
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,320
Then treat me to a drink.

221
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,850
Thank you for waiting.

222
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,770
Enjoy.

223
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,060
The cappuccino here is really good.

224
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,520
I see.

225
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,920
What happened to Hinagiku-san all of a sudden?

226
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,810
It's rare to see you in outside clothes.

227
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,480
R-Really?

228
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,930
Yeah. It looks good on you.

229
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,530
Thank you very much.

230
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,100
Um, you look very cute, too.

231
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,510
Wh-What are you saying all of a sudden?

232
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:43,270
No, I mean your clothes.

233
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,210
Your clothes are cute.

234
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,790
Oh, right. The clothes...

235
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,070
What's wrong, Hinagiku-san?

236
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,740
So, did you do all right on the exam?

237
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,760
No...

238
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,990
Hey, don't put on that sad face again.

239
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:04,380
Let's forget what's past and enjoy ourselves instead.

240
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,290
It's so cute!

241
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,790
It's so nice. I want it.

242
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,970
Watch me. I'll definitely get it.

243
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,940
I put in all the money I had, too.

244
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,300
Do you want that doll that bad?

245
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,680
I guess you have a girly side to you, too.

246
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,030
That's your second strike!

247
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,290
You said the same thing to me yesterday at school.

248
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,920
Something like I wouldn't possibly do anything girly.

249
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,350
No, that was...

250
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,040
Besides, I didn't hear a clear answer.

251
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,970
Spill it! You thought I wrote that letter, didn't you?

252
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,900
You did, didn't you?

253
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,360
No, I absolutely didn't.

254
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,820
Wh-What? So you still mean that I'm not like a girl?

255
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,860
Why do I keep messing things up?

256
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,630
I'm not seriously angry or anything.

257
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,610
I thought that letter was from Hayate-kun at first.

258
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,820
Idiot! Get out of here, Hayate-kun!

259
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,130
See you, bye!

260
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,010
Looks like I made Hinagiku-san mad again.

261
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,800
Why am I always like this?

262
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,540
What am I doing?

263
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,180
I was enjoying it, and then there I went destroying it myself.

264
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,520
Selfish and hates to lose...

265
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:00,960
I've never shown any of my girly sides in front of Hayate-kun.

266
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,660
A kitty!

267
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,620
Wh-What should I do? I can't get up to a place that high.

268
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,310
Actually, wasn't there a similar situation to this before?

269
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,260
What am I remembering at a time like this?

270
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,050
Don't go that way!

271
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,840
I'll get you down right away!

272
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,520
Mustn't look down!

273
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,420
I have to concentrate on what's above me.

274
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,390
Come over this way.

275
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:45,050
There, there, good kitty. You don't have to be afraid anymore.

276
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,580
Thank goodness. I'll take you to your mom right away.

277
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,080
Someone, help me.

278
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,380
I would have come to save you if you'd asked.

279
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,420
H-Hayate-kun...

280
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,730
I would come to save you.

281
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,600
Hayate-kun!

282
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,010
Are you all right, Hinagiku-san?

283
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,250
Hayate-kun?

284
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,690
I-I'm sorry.

285
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:32,080
I-It's fine. Thank you.

286
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,580
And... Um, here.

287
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,890
You got it for me?

288
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,310
You always end up helping me.

289
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:49,030
I told you that I would come to save you if you called.

290
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:04,250
Well, my house is this way.

291
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:04,920
Okay.

292
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,050
Thank you for accompanying me today.

293
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,300
It was really fun.

294
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,350
Oh, for me, too.

295
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,960
Um, if I call for you, would you come again?

296
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,350
Yes. Call me anytime.

297
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,990
I'm good at the UFO catcher.

298
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,260
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

299
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,350
Goodbye.

300
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,480
What's wrong, Hayate?

301
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,580
Oh boy...

302
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,450
What "Oh boy"?

303
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,160
Is the result of the exam that depressing?

304
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,740
No, that's not the case.

305
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,030
An unexpected expense emptied my wallet.

306
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:56,220
Nagi, what should we do for Hinagiku-san's birthday present?

307
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,340
I'll leave it to you to decide.

308
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,310
Um, is Hinagiku-san's birthday soon?

309
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,910
Yes. She was born on March 3rd.

310
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,430
R-Really...

311
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,910
Then I probably should get her something, too.

312
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,680
Why are you giving her a present?

313
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,180
Besides, you just said you don't have any money.

314
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,620
Besides, before you think about Hinagiku-

315
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,790
Oh, right...

316
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,940
Thank you, Hayate-kun.

317
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:31,110
Will Hinagiku be calling for
her special person on her special day?

318
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,230
That'll be for another episode.

319
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:36,060
You might get to see it on some other occasion.

320
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,710
Next week, we'll fight against a really normal story.

321
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:45,050
Yay! I won again!

322
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,690
I give up.

323
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,660
Wow, Sir Taiga is strong.

324
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:52,190
Oh no. The Azumamiya boy's just a great loser.

325
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,190
How much longer are you guys going to continue that?

326
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,260
Katsura Hinagiku's

327
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,660
Butler Network!

328
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,880
Hello. I'm Katsura Hinagiku.

329
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,230
How did you all like this week's Hayate no Gotoku?

330
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:41,030
It was an episode where I had the most lines to say.

331
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:46,870
So they put me on the Butler Network, too,
but I don't know what I should talk about.

332
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,730
What? What is this picture?

333
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,370
W-W-What is this?!

334
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,050
When was this taken?

335
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,740
Hey, who's responsible for this?!

336
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,920
See you again!

337
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,720
Hi, everyone, how are you all?

338
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,660
Next week will be an episode
featuring us, the Student Council Trio.

339
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:12,500
You need to hurry and go buy
a HD recorder with a Blu-Ray disc slot.

340
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,760
So, what will the episode be about?

341
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,700
You'll have to wait and see.

342
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,340
Okay. Stand by until next airing, then!

343
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,970
Next week. Normal story.

344
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,360
I'll be making appearances, so don't worry.

345
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,380
Next week, combine, grand cross, to Hayate no Gotoku!
