1
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:09,400
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,050
Got it?

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,560
A butler is one who serves.

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,060
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:22,880
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,220
Yes.

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:32,840
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,150
Everyone, thank you for watching Hayate no Gotoku again.

9
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,150
Now, let's sing the opening song together!

10
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,760
I wonder what Nishizawa-san is doing right now.

11
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,360
One family.

12
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,900
Five or six customers.

13
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,960
Two couples.

14
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,260
One old man.

15
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,350
Crowded.

16
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,090
No one's here.

17
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,450
Welcome.

18
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,300
Let's see...

19
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:13,140
Anmitsu with cream, egg stew, tokoroten, kuzu mochi, abekawa mochi, isobe yaki, inaka zenzai, and a cream soda.

20
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:13,140
Note: These are all sweets.

21
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,200
All of those, please.

22
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,170
Y-Yes.

23
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,140
I wonder what Hayate-kun's doing right now.

24
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,900
Come to think of it, what did Nishizawa-san come here for the other day?

25
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,230
I shall...

26
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,200
Lick her all over!

27
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,140
Hayate-kun!

28
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,690
Ina**ma Kick!

29
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,050
Eh, Nishizawa-san?

30
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,480
Thank goodness you're here.

31
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,450
And then there was the quarrel with Milady.

32
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,700
Milady and Nishizawa-san.

33
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,010
Delivery.

34
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,510
Thank you very much.

35
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,560
I feel bad for Nishizawa-san.

36
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,240
I love you, Hayate-kun!

37
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,010
I don't want to say goodbye like this.

38
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,570
So please go out with me!

39
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,510
But right now, I don't have the right to date any girls.

40
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,700
Um...

41
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,220
I'm sorry.

42
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,290
I'm...

43
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,220
...only interested in 2-D girls.

44
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,760
Gahhh!!!

45
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,230
I should have said no in a better manner.

46
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,540
You jerk!!!

47
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,630
But I don't know what I'm supposed to do in times like that.

48
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,340
And, why did Milady's face come to mind then?

49
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,760
Is that you, Hayate?

50
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,220
Yes.

51
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,500
A delivery for you, Milady.

52
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,930
Thanks. Will you open it for me?

53
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,160
Milady.

54
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:05,140
You are a girl, so please don't read books in that manner.

55
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,270
O-Okay.

56
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:11,490
I bet an older brother worrying about his little sister must feel like this.

57
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,760
I won't find a girlfriend for a while at this rate.

58
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,010
My hands are full with Milady.

59
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,390
By the way, what is this?

60
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,990
It looks like a document from Hakuou Academy.

61
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,260
It's a transfer form.

62
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:24,820
For you.

63
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,310
So it's for me.

64
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,140
What do you mean, for me?!

65
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,100
Like I said, it's a transfer form so you can enroll into Hakuou.

66
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,200
I haven't heard anything about that! Anything!

67
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,670
I haven't told you anything about it before, either.

68
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,920
But I dropped out of my other school.

69
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,410
I knew of that a long time ago.

70
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,040
I have that school's documents in hand, too.

71
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,980
See? Right here.

72
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,170
But what am I going to do about tuition?

73
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:58,270
I don't have the economical backing to afford it.

74
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:02,430
What are you talking about? Of course, I'll pay.

75
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,030
B-But.

76
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,630
What?

77
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,870
You don't want to go to school with me?

78
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,570
And this is like a thank you to you.

79
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,550
So don't worry about it.

80
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,240
I can go to school again...

81
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,420
Thank you, Milady.

82
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,060
Why are you crying?

83
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,430
Because... Because...

84
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,220
What did you do to make him cry?

85
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,580
No, I didn't make him cry.

86
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,100
He started crying on his own.

87
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,010
After reading this, it appears he has to take a transfer exam.

88
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,130
If you're going to claim to be a Sanzenin butler,

89
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,620
then you'll have to pass Hakuou's transfer exam.

90
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,020
Oh my, Klaus-san.

91
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,510
You're still alive?

92
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,090
Please don't go killing people.

93
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,540
So, if he can't pass the exam, he'll also be fired as a butler.

94
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,520
Hey, what now?

95
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,460
That's fine by me.

96
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,470
After having so much done for me, if I can't pass it,

97
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:21,020
I'll be too ashamed to be a butler... much less a man!

98
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:26,360
So observe everyone! What I can do when I'm serious!

99
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,480
For your information, Hakuou's standard score is just over 65.

100
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,970
It's fine. It'll be fine.

101
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,320
By the way, the exam is tomorrow.

102
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,360
Thank you for the useful information.

103
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,540
But will Hayate-kun really be okay?

104
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:53,270
Seeing his grades from his last school, he's right on the cutoff line.

105
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,110
What's Hayate doing?

106
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,080
He's studying.

107
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,550
I see.

108
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,630
Come in.

109
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,540
How is it going?

110
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,070
Slowly coming along.

111
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,540
Please don't stress over it so much.

112
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,010
Yes.

113
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,990
Just as Maria-san said, I'll call it a night.

114
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,350
Ch-Chief Butler!

115
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,980
Wake up! Please wake up! This is my bed!

116
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,400
Good morning.

117
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,740
It's not morning, yet.

118
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,140
Please get out.

119
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,610
Ayasaki Hayate-kun, you misunderstand me.

120
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,720
I want you to enter Hakuou Academy, as well.

121
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,880
I want you to pass tomorrow's transfer exam!

122
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,360
Do you really?

123
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,280
Do my eyes look like they're lying?

124
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,300
You're scary.

125
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,320
Sorry.

126
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,960
If you're thinking of my welfare,
then please leave and let me sleep.

127
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,540
I'm here to tell you my application process story because I care about you!

128
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,280
I humbly reject your offer.

129
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,010
Accept it!

130
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,770
Stop being nonsensical!

131
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:45,600
I said I don't want to hear it!

132
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:45,600
It was when I applied to a prestigious private kindergarten.

133
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,490
Ahh... He started.

134
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,740
There was a problem I couldn't solve no matter what.

135
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:56,430
The time limit was approaching.

136
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,080
Yet, I couldn't solve it.

137
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,900
And right when the time was about to run out...

138
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,010
Klaus-kun, you pass.

139
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,680
So the lesson is to never give up?

140
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,230
Chief Butler!

141
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,930
Klaus-san!

142
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,200
Get out!

143
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,880
Teretemasu, hisabisa no deban de = I'm blushing because I got some screentime

144
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,880
Teretemasu, hisabisa no deban de

145
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,820
Deluxe animation, Tama no otaku!

146
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,820
Deluxe animation, Tama no otaku! = Deluxe animation, Tama's house!

147
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,930
Sine, cosine, tangent.

148
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,140
I bet they'll come up.

149
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,260
That voice!

150
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:10,600
Tama! Where did you come in from?

151
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:17,800
I'll tell you what Hakuou's exam style and questions are like.

152
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:22,050
I don't want to be taught by you!

153
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,150
Get out!

154
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,520
Ow.

155
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,090
This should do it.

156
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,680
Hayate, Hayate.

157
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,960
You don't have to worry. Sleep tight.

158
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,710
Roar!!!

159
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,300
Are you all right?

160
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,370
I'm only lacking a bit of sleep.

161
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,000
A train?

162
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,910
It's because the campus is so large.

163
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,940
I've done the best I could.

164
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,630
I wonder what kind of questions I'll get.

165
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,730
I think it'll be English and such, like any other place.

166
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,970
But I don't think you'll pass using Moe-tan.

167
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:59,400
You think Hakuou Academy's transfer exam is something ordinary?

168
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,210
Nagi-chan?

169
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,730
Welcome, former intruder.

170
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,720
And Nagi-chan!

171
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,370
I'm today's proctor, the beautiful world history teacher,

172
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,720
Katsura Yukiji.

173
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,330
"B-Beautiful?"

174
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,500
Don't question that word!!!

175
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:25,740
Not ordinary? But I took an ordinary exam when I entered here.

176
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,510
If you rely on the past, you won't gain anything in the future, Nagi-chan.

177
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,300
I'm not sure about only looking forward.

178
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,880
Anyway, we'll start the transfer exam, so follow me!

179
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,720
The topic is... the Redmond-style interview exam!

180
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:49,930
The Redmond-style interview exam is...

181
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,400
...a popular exam style during job interviews...

182
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,370
...to see the candidate's true intelligence through logic questions.

183
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,430
"Why is a manhole cover round?"

184
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:03,230
It's an exam that doesn't rely on memorization...

185
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,070
...and tests only the intelligence by asking....

186
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:08,550
...and answering peculiar questions and so on, as logically as possible.

187
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,360
I see. This sure is the famous Hakuou Academy.

188
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,850
The exam style is unique on its own.

189
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,060
By the way, why is a manhole cover round?

190
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,650
Because if it's square, a slight tilt will make it fall.

191
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,140
The length of a diagonal in a square is longer than its sides.

192
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,480
Whereas a circle doesn't have that problem.

193
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,840
You're so smart!

194
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,090
Obviously. I don't go to Hakuou for nothing.

195
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,140
Okay, let's start the exam.

196
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,490
It'll be inside this classroom.

197
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,820
The test begins the moment you step in.

198
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,230
Everything you do or say in here affects your score.

199
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,510
Get ready.

200
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,340
Question one is...

201
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,170
This!

202
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,190
SFX: SNAP

203
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,420
SFX: RATATATATATATA

204
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,220
Are you making fun of Hayate?

205
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,250
Or are teachers forgiven no matter what they do?

206
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,430
Nagi-chan, your jabs are brutal.

207
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,830
But! This is Hakuou Academy!

208
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,300
And, this is a Redmond-style interview exam that tests true intelligence!

209
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,650
If you want to, go ahead and answer the question as you imagined.

210
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,780
But I wonder if that's the answer.

211
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,800
She's right.

212
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:56,950
At a glance, this is an intelligence test where
a monkey has to get the banana using tools.

213
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:03,500
But in Redmond-style interview exams,
usually the first thing that comes to your mind is incorrect.

214
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,380
Then...

215
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,600
I got it.

216
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:13,940
The point to this question is the height at which the banana is hung.

217
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:19,180
The banana is actually at a height low enough to reach by hand.

218
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,180
Therefore all the tools around it are just to fool you,

219
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:30,120
and the answer is to take it without using any of the tools.

220
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,110
This is the answer.

221
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:46,810
SFX: Growl~~

222
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:48,810
The one and only food for the monkeys that couldn't get the food and are starving.

223
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:54,550
Oh damn it, so that's how you play it, eh?

224
00:18:54,550 --> 00:19:01,770
I get it. So I get to become red all over after these long, peaceful days?

225
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,120
But listen.

226
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,730
If I don't beat this,

227
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,400
I can't go to school!

228
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,210
Here I go!

229
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,870
So he fights rather than running away.

230
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,010
This is animal abuse.

231
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,910
But, wow, your butler puts up a good fight.

232
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,540
Well, his life depends on this exam.

233
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,020
I see.

234
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,870
Then let's end the joke here and get the real exam started.

235
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,500
What?! This was a joke?!

236
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:56,080
Of course! If you can test for intelligence with an exam like this, then where's the effort?

237
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,970
Then what was all of this for?

238
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:03,910
As a token of my thanks, I thought I'd let you loosen up.

239
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,150
I don't need this kind of thanks.

240
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:13,700
And so Hayate takes the exam
physically and mentally beaten up.

241
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,380
Calm down. Calm down first.

242
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,280
How did it go?

243
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,940
I managed to answer all the questions.

244
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:31,590
But if I didn't pass it after all you've done for me, what should I do?

245
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,950
Why are you being so pessimistic now?

246
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,130
I'm sure you passed.

247
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,340
You're the person I have faith in,

248
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,560
so let's go to school together.

249
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,860
You're right, Milady.

250
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,610
Heh, Superindendent...

251
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,590
You want me to send this to Sanzenin?

252
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,150
But... Superindendent...

253
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,110
Is it correct to assume you made a typo?

254
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:19,100
He was a point away from the passing line.

255
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,200
He almost made it.

256
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,360
I... I see...

257
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,930
If he had answered more calmly, he might have passed.

258
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,160
He was really close.

259
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,280
Therefore,

260
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,360
I leave you to your task, Katsura-sensei.

261
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,580
Meanwhile, at the Sanzenin's,
where they don't know what's to come...

262
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,790
It's little early, but let's start the celebration party.

263
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,470
What? Really?

264
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,530
I'm so happy!

265
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,640
...they're already in a party mode.

266
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,220
Nagi and...

267
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,240
Hayate's...

268
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,760
Butler Network!

269
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,860
Hayate, was studying for the test fun?

270
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,990
Yes, I was able to enjoy the mood of a student.

271
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,620
Thank you very much, Milady.

272
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,000
No need for that, Hayate.

273
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,950
We'll be able to go to school together every day from now on.

274
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,980
Well, I guess so.

275
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,590
It'll be goodbye to your all-night online gaming life.

276
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,810
I don't like that idea.

277
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:53,640
Eh?

278
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,210
I know! You can skip school with me from now on!

279
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,220
Ehhh?!?!

280
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,720
Bye bye!

281
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,800
I meant it as a prank! I meant it as a simple joke!

282
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,490
I never thought he'd fail by just one point!

283
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,860
So you want me to go apologize with you?

284
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,750
Yes, exactly.

285
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,490
Today's party will be a blast.

286
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,350
It's all for he who was admitted to Hakuou.

287
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,210
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

288
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:22,510
Wait a Moment! I Have to Go to the Party. Make It Fast.

289
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:25,740
This situation makes it harder to bring the issue up than I'd thought.

290
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,380
Apocalyptic destiny.
