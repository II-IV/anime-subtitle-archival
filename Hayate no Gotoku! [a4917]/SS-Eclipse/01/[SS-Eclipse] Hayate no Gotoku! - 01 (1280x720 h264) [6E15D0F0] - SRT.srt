1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,320
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:09,990
Got it?

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,320
Hey, Sanzenin Nagi! Be a good girl and get caught by this robot!

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,600
Don't joke with me! Why should I?

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:34,710
Because, there's a person who'll profit from your death.

6
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,710
It's impossible for the following five reasons.

7
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,440
What?

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,490
First: you're stupid.

9
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,750
Second: you're really stupid.

10
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,180
Third: you're extremely stupid.

11
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,830
Fourth: you're revolutionarily, cosmically stupid.

12
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,990
And fifth is...

13
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,880
That's enough out of you! Die!

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,610
Hayate!

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,510
What?

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,560
Did you call me, Milady?

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,730
Hayate...

18
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,100
Wh-Who are you?

19
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,340
Ah, me?

20
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,280
Um...

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,080
Hurry. The opening song's about to start.

22
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,000
Um... I'm this Sanzenin family's-

23
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,530
A butler is one who serves.

24
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,000
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

25
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,960
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

26
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,400
Yes.

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:42,880
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

28
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,500
Hey, the narration is too fast!

29
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,690
I'm, um...

30
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,300
Mr. Santa Claus, why do you never bring presents to me?

31
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,760
That's because your family is poor.

32
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,080
What? Th-Then what am I supposed to do?

33
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,410
Work!

34
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,320
Those who do not work do not deserve to eat.

35
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,950
If you have something you want,
do something about it with your own strength.

36
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,300
B-But...

37
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,480
But have faith.

38
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:45,470
The last one to smile is the diligent and earnest one.

39
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,690
Mr. Santa Claus.

40
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,320
Even then, I still won't give you a present.

41
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,580
What do you mean?

42
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,610
Wait, hold on!

43
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,620
Hey!

44
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:04,510
The last line bugged me, but I decided to believe in Santa's words and live.

45
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,010
Until today!

46
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,890
What are we going to do? If we don't have the manuscript in five minutes...

47
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,720
This week's volume is over!!!

48
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,870
Rest easy!

49
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,660
The fastest bicycle delivery service in the market is coming!

50
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,810
The fastest?

51
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,080
It's here! That's it!

52
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,880
Sorry to make you wait!

53
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,420
Ayasaki Hayate from the bicycle delivery service.

54
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,060
Signature, please?

55
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:57,890
Thank you very much, fastest bicycle delivery service in the trade with an inhuman-like sturdy body!

56
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,460
But seriously, are you okay?

57
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,990
Please don't worry.

58
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,280
I'm well trained.

59
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,670
Well, thank you for your patronage. I hope to see you again.

60
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,870
Hold on!

61
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,730
Don't worry about me.

62
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,620
Really.

63
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,490
No, in front of you! In front!

64
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,410
I'm sorry! Are you all right?!

65
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,140
How pitiful, when he's such a good boy.

66
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:30,980
Really.

67
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,480
That boy has terrible luck.

68
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,210
That hurt.

69
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,380
Oh man...

70
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,920
And it's supposed to be Christmas Eve?

71
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:47,050
Yes, right now, the boy is an ordinary high school boy that commutes to an ordinary public high school.

72
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,360
Hey, it's Hayate.

73
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:54,290
Why hello, my ordinary classmates that commute to my ordinary public high school.

74
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,990
Sorry, we're ordinary.

75
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,430
So what's up with the gathering?

76
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,820
Oh, could it be a Christmas Party?

77
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,540
Yeah. If you're free, you should come, too.

78
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,710
I'm looking forward to the party.

79
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,620
You can eat and drink all you want for ¥3,000.

80
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,620
We've got to eat a lot.

81
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,740
But I don't have any money, and I'm still in middle of work.

82
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,250
You better be ready.

83
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,740
You're unsociable as always.

84
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,690
Hayate-kun, you're very athletic, so join a club.

85
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,620
But that reduces the amount of time I can work.

86
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,650
"Work", "work", is all you say! Are you a money monger?

87
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,670
You can't buy friendship with money!

88
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,090
Besides, why do you need money that badly?

89
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,700
That's because... well...

90
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,230
My parents are unemployed.

91
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,320
S-Sorry, we were a little too hyper.

92
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,200
Bye.

93
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:46,910
Yes, if the reason they were unemployed was due to corporate downsizing, there would be room to pity him.

94
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,920
However, Hayate's father is...

95
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:59,300
Note: 父 means Father

96
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,520
Yay! You know what "searching for oneself" means?

97
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,900
I think there's a job more suited for me out there.

98
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,950
...in his own little wonderland.

99
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:09,780
Note: 母 means Mother

100
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,530
You see, your mother's not wasting money.

101
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,520
I'm investing it in my dream!

102
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,240
And his mother boycotts house chores and wanders the streets.

103
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,560
Those who do not work do not deserve to eat.

104
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,650
But I believe!

105
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,520
The last one to smile is the diligent and earnest one!

106
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,650
Ayasaki-kun, you're fired.

107
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,870
You hid your age, didn't you?

108
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,990
I hear you're still in high school.

109
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,520
H-How did you find out?

110
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,170
Your parents just came over and notified me.

111
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,950
I thought you were a diligent young man, but you betrayed me.

112
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,520
Anyways, your pay for the month, ¥170,000, is with your parents-

113
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,590
Y-You gave it to them?

114
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:50,210
If you give that much money to them,
they'll spend it all away as investments for some dream!

115
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,060
Ridiculous. How could there be parents like that?

116
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,180
Because there are, I'm working with my age hidden.

117
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,440
What has he done?!

118
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,600
They better know that that's precious money.

119
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,260
Dad! Mom!

120
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,890
Where's my paycheck?!

121
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,290
Thank goodness, they haven't used it yet.

122
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,990
Sorry~ I tried investing in my dream, but I failed.

123
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,620
Tehe.

124
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,370
Mommy.

125
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,390
H-How are we supposed to greet the New Year with this?

126
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,460
We don't have any more savings, either.

127
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,940
Dear Hayate-kun.

128
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,780
Your Christmas present.

129
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,570
What's this?

130
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,410
One... Ten... Hundred... Thousand... Ten thousand... Hundred thousand... Million... Ten million... Hundred million?

131
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,800
An IOU for ¥156,804,000?!

132
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,270
We borrowed money from very generous people!

133
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,430
And so, thanks for paying them back.

134
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,570
You idiots!!!

135
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,200
But you know, we can't do anything about it now that the debt has been made.

136
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,760
Don't turn defiant about it.

137
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,730
But it's a pain to work off, and we don't have money in our family anymore.

138
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,980
After your Daddy and Mommy did lots of thinking, we came up with a great idea.

139
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,140
Great idea?

140
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,950
I know!! We'll give it to Hayate-kun as a present!!! It is Christmas, after all.

141
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,930
D-Dad! Mom!

142
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,070
Hey, Ayasaki-san, you home?

143
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,600
We're here to take your son away.

144
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,620
Would you be the very generous people?

145
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:53,720
That's right, we're the generous people that lent money to your parents.

146
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:59,350
O-Oh please, dear generous people. My parents who owe you money are no longer here.

147
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:03,110
Besides, there's no way I can pay ¥156,804,000 back.

148
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:06,390
Don't sweat it. We're professional, as well.

149
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:13,790
Come with us, you'll go to a paradise in the south as a volunteer,

150
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:20,260
or we'll have you become a delivery man that travels across the world,

151
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:28,570
or it's not a bad idea to have you become a consultant that teaches traffic rules.

152
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,180
We can help you out a lot.

153
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,050
Where do you think you're going, kiddo?!

154
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,590
I managed to get away, but I never thought they'd go this far.

155
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,250
I can't believe my parents.

156
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:06,220
No matter how many times I read it, it says ¥156,804,000.

157
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,980
I guess I was abandoned by them.

158
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,240
But have faith.

159
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,890
The last one to smile is the diligent and earnest...

160
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,660
No!

161
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,150
In the end, the shrewd people are the winners.

162
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,500
There isn't a thing that I can gain from working diligently.

163
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:32,540
Nello from A Dog of Flanders died after being a good boy!

164
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:32,540
A Dog of Flanders (1872): Novel by English writer Marie Louise de la Ramée, about a poor Flemish boy named Nello and his dog Patrache

165
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,780
What is this machine?

166
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,840
It won't take credit cards?

167
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,890
It was the destined meeting of the boy and the girl.

168
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,390
Hayate no Gotoku!

169
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,430
Christmas.

170
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,680
We lost track of him.

171
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,170
What a fast kiddo.

172
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,430
Find him no matter what.

173
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,380
You two, as well. This is nowhere near enough.

174
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,470
Pay back everything by tomorrow,
or else you know what'll happen, don't you?!

175
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,440
Y-Yes.

176
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:19,680
Debt collectors like them will never let go of me.

177
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,570
Exactly.

178
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,680
You're doomed.

179
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,510
Just go to them and-

180
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,130
Hayate, you must not give up.

181
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,930
Since you were born a human,
you must keep working until the very end.

182
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,370
What can he possibly do now?

183
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,170
Let's kidnap that girl.

184
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:36,610
Huh?

185
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:41,560
You'll kidnap her and ask for a hundred-fifty million yen.

186
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,440
I see.

187
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,400
W-Wait, isn't that going a little overboard?

188
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,200
But thanks to the parents I have, my life is in danger now.

189
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,260
Yes. Some evil acts shall be overlooked. They have to be.

190
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,360
You shouldn't.

191
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,060
I'm sure Nello and Patrache are speaking to you from Heaven.

192
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,630
"Avenge us."

193
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,920
That's right. Even if I get arrested,
jail will have warm food and a bed.

194
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,410
Hey, don't touch me.

195
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,720
Hey, you're really cute.

196
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,320
You're all alone on Christmas Eve?

197
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,140
Let's go somewhere fun.

198
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,120
Don't flirt on the day Nello died.

199
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,610
Gaze on the painting of Rubens and reflect on your act, you fool!

200
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,610
Peter Paul Rubens: Flemish painter of the Late 16th and Early 17th Centuries

201
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,830
Hey.

202
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,130
I was never hit by my father, too.

203
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,530
We're sorry!

204
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:36,050
C-Crap, I jumped out instinctively.

205
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:36,990
Thank you.

206
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,010
I'm not really sure, but you saved me.

207
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,640
By the way, do you know what this is?

208
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:56,750
I want this "warm", but it won't come out even when I press the button.

209
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,140
Well, you have to put the money in.

210
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,830
Without this "warm", I'll freeze to death.

211
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:20,500
It's not good for a girl to catch a cold, so keep that on.

212
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,310
It's a cheap jacket.

213
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,950
It's made rough, and the fabric is heavy.

214
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,940
And it doesn't fit me.

215
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,930
But it's warm, so I like it.

216
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,710
Right, as a token of my thanks to this warmth, let me do something for you.

217
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,710
Thanks?

218
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,450
Anything will do. Say it.

219
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,510
Anything?

220
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,960
Are you sure?

221
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:42,690
Yup.

222
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,380
That's right; I have no choice but to do it.

223
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,990
The boy made up his mind.

224
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:56,010
He decided to have her become
the hostage to be held for ransom.

225
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,230
Then, I'll be really blunt.

226
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,160
Go out with me.

227
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,440
I want you!

228
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,030
This wrong choice of words made
the two's relationship really complicated.

229
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,020
Just because it's Christmas Eve...

230
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,640
D-Do you understand what you're saying?

231
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,150
I can't say things like this in jest.

232
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,300
I'm risking my life here.

233
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,820
The moment I saw you, I decided to take you away!

234
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,950
His seriousness passes on to her.

235
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:34,230
But correctly or not is another question.

236
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,830
F-Fine, but...

237
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,910
...never cheat on me, got it?!

238
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,370
Eh? Um...

239
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,370
Okay.

240
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,080
"Cheat"?

241
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,340
All right, then can you give me your guardian's number?

242
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:51,960
Sure.

243
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,500
Okay, wait for me here for a while.

244
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,530
My heart is still pounding.

245
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:02,660
But that man's strong and kind and cool!

246
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,080
Hayate.

247
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,850
Is this his name?

248
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,220
Haya-

249
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,960
It's time to ask for ransom money anonymously.

250
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,080
No one can stop me now.

251
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,460
Hello.

252
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,630
Hello, this is Ayasaki speaking.

253
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,380
What are you doing giving your identity out, kidnapper?

254
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,090
It's over.

255
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,310
My perfect plot...

256
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,450
And it hadn't even begun...

257
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:56,040
Daddy, Mommy, why is that person not wearing a coat in this cold weather?

258
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,960
Shh.

259
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,150
Yeah, this is how I'm supposed to end up.

260
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:05,570
Working diligently or trying to commit evil, neither works.

261
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,940
I'm tired now.

262
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,330
Will I die if I sleep like this?

263
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:17,720
So what if I do? It's only going to be painful even if I live on.

264
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,020
Not like anyone will care if I die.

265
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,750
Are you all right?

266
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,670
Oh no, you're so cold.

267
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:57,640
If you sleep in a place like this, you'll catch cold.

268
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,500
It was unexpected.

269
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:07,520
That kind smile was a quick remedy for the boy who was at the lowest point of his life.

270
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,550
Um, hello?

271
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:19,110
Patrache, I was wrong.

272
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,640
There's a very kind person like her in this world.

273
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,610
Yet, I was thinking of something as stupid as kidnapping.

274
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,100
What are you doing?

275
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,070
Don't make noise!

276
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,610
Hurry and get moving!

277
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,430
That's right; what am I doing?

278
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,980
Stop taking your time.

279
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,520
Hey-

280
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,760
Get in already.

281
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,880
Eh?

282
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,650
Oh no, she's getting kidnapped again.

283
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,310
Someone you know?

284
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:46,070
Yes. What should I do? Himegami-kun isn't around, either.

285
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,330
I'll borrow this for a while.

286
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,980
You call the police.

287
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,090
I will save her.

288
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,670
Save? But they're in a car.

289
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,730
Yes. This anime will never let any crimes go unpunished.

290
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:08,120
Kidnapping is not cool.

291
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,180
All right, we succeeded at kidnapping.

292
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,510
Now we can get loads of ransom money and pay our debt back.

293
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,250
Hey, two idiots.

294
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,900
You're contaminating the air, so stop breathing.

295
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,520
You're destroying nature.

296
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,160
Make sure you treat the Earth kindly.

297
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,570
Th-This brat!

298
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,860
You better not make us angry.

299
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,360
I told you not to breathe, you baldy!

300
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,650
If you don't stop acting like a snob, you'll really get it.

301
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,850
Don't come near me, pervert!

302
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,550
Come any closer, and I'll call someone over, you idiot!

303
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,390
You're the idiot, little one.

304
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,990
You think anyone can catch up to a car moving this fast?

305
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,900
Yes, there is.

306
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,130
He said he'll take me away even at the cost of his life.

307
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,770
So he'll come if I call him.

308
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,360
Then why not call him this very moment?

309
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,600
Hayate!

310
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,180
What?

311
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,750
Hayate.

312
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,060
Villains! Hand her back to me now!

313
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,750
Bro!

314
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,310
Shut up! It's his fault for jumping out in front.

315
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,450
How dare you two-

316
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,830
Can you give her back to me?

317
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,680
Y-Yes.

318
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,850
Hayate...

319
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:44,430
Get moving. Go.

320
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,990
Hey, how's your body?

321
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,260
Please don't worry; I train.

322
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,260
I'm really glad you're safe.

323
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,050
I need to repay you again.

324
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,600
Repay?

325
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,830
But I was about to-

326
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:02,460
What? Don't hesitate. Say anything you want.

327
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,210
Then, could you find me a new job?

328
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,510
Hey!

329
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,290
Are you really okay?

330
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,350
Hey, I see a red liquid coming out of you.

331
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:19,430
It's nothing. It's only a scratch on my head, body, and appendages that we can't put on the airwaves to broadcast.

332
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,030
Hayate!

333
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,780
Hey! Hayate.

334
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:23,800
Nagi.

335
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,950
Oh, Maria.

336
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,130
Perfect timing. Treat him now!

337
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:31,840
I have asked Klaus-san to come get us.

338
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,380
But this is...

339
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,660
And that pathetic looking jacket is?

340
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,670
Yes, it is a miserably cheap jacket,

341
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,610
but it's a jacket the person who saved my life gave to me.

342
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,720
If I don't take care of it, it'll defile the Sanzenin family's name.

343
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,880
The person who... saved your life?

344
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,560
Come to think of, the replacement for Himegami is still undecided, isn't it?

345
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,590
Let's put him there!

346
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,020
What?

347
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,480
Bring that injured man to this car!

348
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,790
Don't worry. He's taken care of.

349
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,850
I promised him that I'd find him a new job.

350
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,050
I need to show my gratitude, as well.

351
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:09,820
So I'll make him my, Sanzenin Nagi's, new butler!

352
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,270
Yes, it was the destined meeting.

353
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:18,900
From this day on, the boy's life takes a different turn.

354
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,110
But we'll save the details for another occasion.

355
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:24,120
We'll be fighting against the broadcasting code next week, too.

356
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,520
Hayate, you were looking for live-in work, weren't you?

357
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,490
Y-Yes.

358
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:08,060
Then be my butler here at the mansion.

359
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,500
But Hayate-kun, do you know what a butler does?

360
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,250
I'll do it!

361
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:15,930
No matter what happens,
I'll protect Milady, even at the cost of my own life!

362
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,060
What should we do about these two naturally empty minds?

363
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,760
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

364
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,250
Sanzenin Nagi's Mansion and a New Start.

365
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,210
We meet again, kiddo.

366
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,110
Honestly, next week will be interesting and cool, too!
