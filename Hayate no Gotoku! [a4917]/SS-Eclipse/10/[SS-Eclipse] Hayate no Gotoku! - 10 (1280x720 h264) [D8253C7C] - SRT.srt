1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,330
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,020
Got it?

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,120
Let's stop with the chit-chat,

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,080
And now let's quietly observe.

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,870
If you're looking for a romance, it's already begun.

6
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,600
A butler is one who serves.

7
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,390
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

8
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:05,030
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

9
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,330
Yes.

10
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:15,120
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

11
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,390
This one is an original episode planned by Mister Hata.

12
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,250
Right?

13
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,220
So I hear.

14
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,540
Damn it.

15
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,890
Damn it, what's wrong with this game?

16
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,860
The graphics really suck; are you sure this is a *S3 game?

17
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,150
No, it isn't.

18
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,370
But I got tired of high-definition games, so I felt like playing an old game.

19
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,940
Oh, so recent games aren't good enough for you.

20
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,300
Then you can go play outside-

21
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,450
That makes me tired.

22
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,640
You got that right, but...

23
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,720
Rather than doing such a thing,

24
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,610
I want to play an old game and gain a new perspective on the high-definition games around the world.

25
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:30,090
Game Cartridge: Large Size of 4MB    New Dragon Hero Quest

26
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:30,390
I got a hold of an old rare game in an attempt to cleanse a dirty mind with its old nostalgic feeling, but...

27
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,150
Rather than you call this rare, the quality is you-know-what.

28
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,550
Simply put, that's what it is.

29
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,860
I have heard that the quality is you-know-what, but this game is worse than I'd thought.

30
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,630
Isn't that the good part about retro games?

31
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,490
But then, the sound is cheap, and the movements are blocky.

32
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:50,030
The graphics are so poor, you can hardly tell where you are.

33
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,600
Shut up Kansai person.

34
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,310
Go eat octopus puffs with white rice.

35
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,470
What'd'you say?!

36
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,340
Are you mocking the people of Kansai?

37
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,620
Sakuya, don't jump on a game.

38
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,720
You stop blaming the game when you suck.

39
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,550
Midget.

40
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,330
What did you call me?!

41
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,940
Damn you! Damn you shitty game!

42
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,300
I'll forever only put "AAA" in any name slot!

43
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,050
Um, the food's ready.

44
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,040
What are you two doing?

45
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,340
Nothing much. We were only removing an evil from this world.

46
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,760
What?

47
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,700
Anyway, what's for dinner?

48
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,520
Bell peppers stuffed with beef.

49
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,890
What? I don't like bell peppers.

50
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,590
You don't grow because you're selective with food.

51
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,150
And possibly more than just your height is at issue.

52
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,150
Wh-What are you implying?

53
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,880
Stop staring.

54
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,870
I haven't said anything, yet.

55
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,020
What did you think I was talking about?

56
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,340
The next morning!

57
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,040
The sun...

58
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,440
Why does it rise every morning?

59
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,270
What are you doing, complaining to great nature the moment you wake up?

60
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,960
The sun just doesn't understand!

61
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,430
Because you get rid of or take a rest from things from time to time,

62
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,610
when it does come back to us,
only then do we take pleasure from it.

63
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,720
W-We really shouldn't be putting thoughts like that on the airwave.

64
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,960
In any case, please get changed and get ready to go to school.

65
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,820
Sakuya-san and company are waiting.

66
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,800
Makita, Kunieda!

67
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,410
I'm off to school now!

68
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,180
"School", "school". Whatever.

69
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,870
"School", "school". Whatever.

70
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,090
Maria, am I having a déjá vu?

71
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,950
This scene is familiar looking.

72
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,890
Apparently this episode takes place during the same time frame as two episodes ago.

73
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,350
So they're zapping.

74
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,360
Anime's getting complicated, too.

75
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,170
The world has Digital broadcast, EP recording, digital coloration,

76
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:02,570
exportation to other countries in gross quantities,
storyboards being bid on net auctions, and a Minister of Manga.

77
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,850
I see, fine. I'll go along with this then.

78
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,810
Looks like I'll get to skip out of school, too.

79
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,860
Oh, so that's your reason this time?

80
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,800
"I'm off to school now!"

81
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,020
Sakuya exuberantly runs out of the room,

82
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,500
but she suddenly feels the urge to watch ***'s DVD, and turns back to the mansion's 2nd floor.

83
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,720
And she opens the door to the game room, and there she finds-

84
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,500
So you've seen me.

85
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,500
You...

86
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,810
I won't let you out of here alive.

87
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,170
Makita. Kunikita.

88
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:40,180
Ah! NO! You're going to break me!

89
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,480
Oh, it wasn't a fire?

90
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,810
Hey you! You're a game console!
What do you think you're doing talking?!

91
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,990
I'm so sticky ~tima.

92
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,390
"Tima"?

93
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,490
What kinda ending is that?

94
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,570
Is that the latest trend?

95
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,000
I get it. You must be the demon or something from that game, aren't ya?

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,990
Super observation.

97
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,630
Tima! How did you know?

98
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,470
And looks like she was right.

99
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,980
So I'm right?

100
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,820
I bet since you're such a shitty game, the hate to it got accumulated,

101
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,500
and what happened last night awakened you as a monster.

102
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,220
That ought to summarize it, eh?

103
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,720
S-Super observation ~tima.

104
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,440
I already said that.

105
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,290
So you know, I'm smart enough to reject an offer from Hakuou.

106
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,580
And I don't even have any status.

107
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,760
Makita, Kunieda. Break this thing before it does anything.

108
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,260
Aim for the reset button and the plug.

109
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,760
Don't come ~tima!

110
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,000
And that "Tima" ending is really pissing me off.

111
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,770
Tima~

112
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,240
Punishment.

113
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,580
The Demon's Castle!

114
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,820
I can't move! Can't get out ~tima!

115
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,880
A punishment! A punishment! A punishment!

116
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,580
Geez, shut up, shut up, shut up!

117
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,030
I was finally able to come out to the real world!

118
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,460
The Hero shows up at the end of the world.

119
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,030
That's right ~tima. I'm the last boss.

120
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,440
And this castle is the stage for the last battle.

121
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,730
If I defeat the Hero...

122
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,190
Tima~~

123
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,500
I might really be able to get out of here ~tima!

124
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,710
No, I think you'll go back to the title screen.

125
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,800
Now that that's settled, I first have to capture the Hero ~tima.

126
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,420
She's not listening to me.

127
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,240
Press.

128
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,000
It's set.

129
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,990
Um, Sir Hero! Please get caught!

130
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,150
Tima~

131
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,980
What do you think about this, Maria?

132
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,500
That looks good.

133
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:29,980
Tima!

134
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,850
Where are you going?

135
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,190
You can't walk around the house in that sailor uniform, can you?

136
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,690
Timama!

137
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,360
Tima! Tima! Tima!

138
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:45,030
Tima! Tima! Tima! Tima! Tima! Tima!

139
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,270
Tima! Tima! Tima! Tima! Tima! Tima! Tima! Tima! Tima! Tima! Tima! Tima! Tima! Tima!

140
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:53,850
Demon, The Great Stygian of Abe (Temp) wept.

141
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,730
This is horrible. Nobody notices me ~tima.

142
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,050
Punishment.

143
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,570
Geez, shut up, shut up, shut up!

144
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,220
Is someone here, ~tima?

145
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,550
No one's coming.

146
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:15,040
Eh? And we came all the way to see Nagi-chan's new butler.

147
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,710
We can't do anything about it, then.

148
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:20,820
Let's give up and instead go to Ekoda.

149
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,200
We shall and skip the rest of the classes.

150
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,310
What's this?

151
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,350
Miki-chan?!

152
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,650
Miki-chan, your underwear's sexy.

153
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,330
It's a new pair.

154
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,160
Let me see.

155
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,860
Owee...

156
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,030
What happened?

157
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,000
You're heavy.

158
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,880
Th-Thank you for noticing me.

159
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:13,520
Ahem. Now, Heroes. Your mission is to come find me at the Demon's Castle ~tima!

160
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,620
I hear breast-bouncing noises.

161
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,020
What's that?

162
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,140
This is horrible.

163
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,810
Wow, a graphic is moving.

164
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:24,760
No, from what I think, an old mistreated shitty game...

165
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,060
And abbreviating the rest.

166
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,170
What? Then we're inside the world of a game?

167
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,100
Now Heroes, time to fight that monster.

168
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:38,960
Fine. This happened because I picked up that controller.

169
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,830
I have no choice.

170
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:44,120
Y-You can't, Miki-chan! You can't fight alone!

171
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,240
Oh great Demon! She's the Hero!

172
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,060
Oh no!

173
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,750
Risa is dead!

174
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,930
The rest is up to you two.

175
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,950
Wh-What?!

176
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,940
Oh no! At this rate, the Heroes that finally came will die ~tima!

177
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,910
Punishment!

178
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,420
No they won't!

179
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,580
Press.

180
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,950
Hey, are you all right?

181
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,230
Somehow.

182
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,510
That was close ~tima.

183
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,800
Punishment!

184
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,580
Someone has it easy.

185
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,300
Risa-chin, you're cheating.

186
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,630
What! It's actually tight in here and not so comfortable!

187
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,810
I want to revive and fight with you all.

188
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,050
Y-You do?

189
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:54,180
I'm sure it's painful for you right now,
but we promise to find a village and revive you soon.

190
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,230
Thank you.

191
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,070
By the way, can I ask one more favor?

192
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,320
W-What is it?

193
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,060
I'm thirsty, so go buy me Poka**.

194
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,430
You're so mean, Risa-chin.

195
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,440
Stop playing a game inside a game.

196
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,910
No! This is, you know,
research to see if I can contact the real world.

197
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,950
Don't lie.

198
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,310
While the trio were arguing inside the game,

199
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:23,110
there was one person who noticed something was going on inside the mansion.

200
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:28,800
What should I do? I got lost the moment I woke up.

201
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,290
And to bring it up, this power I sense; it must be a ghost.

202
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,060
It must be in here.

203
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,470
I was wrong.

204
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,910
You'll find out the top three in part B!

205
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,880
Sumeshi Beam!

206
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,880
Sumeshi Beam! = Vinegared Rice Beam!

207
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,890
Old gag by comedy Trio, Dachou Club.

208
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,890
Musshu Mura Mura

209
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,860
Today's Fortune Countdown!

210
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,660
The third is Cancer.

211
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,940
Your lucky spot is a hot spring.

212
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,710
You might meet destiny.

213
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,870
In second place is Taurus.

214
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,420
A happy day where everything you do will work out.

215
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,290
If you're going to quit being a NEET, today's the day.

216
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:25,940
Be courageous!

217
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,550
And first place is!

218
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,720
Happy smiles.

219
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,910
Great selection.

220
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:39,890
At Rental Video Tachibana Shinjuku HQ,
we wait to see people who can tell the difference.

221
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:46,880
Now please continue to enjoy Hayate no Gotoku episode 10,
Witnessed the Tear of the Snake Woman.

222
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:55,880
The Student Council Trio trapped in
the game finally made it to a village.

223
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,240
Where's the church?

224
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,340
I want to revive my friend out of the casket.

225
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,790
No matter who I talk to, they only say "Nunu"!

226
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,610
Looks like this game is beyond our capabilities.

227
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,160
Fine, then I'll have to...

228
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,390
I am very heated up right now!

229
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,100
Kin* Squasher!

230
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,990
Hello. Yes, it's me Miki.

231
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,800
Sorry, but please come here right now.

232
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:53,780
Here I am.

233
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,270
So?

234
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:55,770
So fast!

235
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:59,780
Um, Hina-chan, didn't you get attacked by something strange on the way?

236
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:04,570
Yeah I did, but I shooed them away with this.

237
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,970
So what's this all about?

238
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,880
Give me a good explanation.

239
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,890
Don't be surprised hearing this.

240
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,750
We're inside a cursed game,
and *mumble mumble*, abbreviating the rest.

241
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,580
There's no way such an unscientific thing could happen.

242
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,250
U-Um...

243
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:31,390
This is, you know, must be a elaborate
surprise event set by Nagi, since she loves games.

244
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:31,970
It has to be.

245
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,010
But this is really well-made.

246
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,010
That's our President for you.

247
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,940
How are these moving?

248
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,080
She's so down-to-earth.

249
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,940
In a way, it's an amazing talent.

250
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,130
By the way, you three weren't intending to skip afternoon classes, were you?

251
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,350
A-Absolutely not.

252
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,340
Then let's take care of this and go back to school before lunch break ends.

253
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,290
Oh, but where's the goal?

254
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,250
S-So reliable.

255
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,500
She is suitable to be the Hero ~tima.

256
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,380
Punishment, punishment, punishment.

257
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:12,340
If she comes here, I might be freed from this noisy skull and this annoying "tima" ending ~tima.

258
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:13,710
Press.

259
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,090
Banner: Over here ~tima

260
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,560
Equipment came falling from the sky all of a sudden.

261
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,000
I see. So you want us to use those to get to that tower.

262
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,560
Is that what those are for?

263
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,370
All right then, let us all go beat the Demon!

264
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,700
Hakuou! Fight!

265
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,590
F-Fight, oh!

266
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,680
Fight!

267
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,700
Hinagiku's so diligent.

268
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,700
Fight, oh!

269
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,380
Looks like we can leave the story to Katsura-san.

270
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:48,850
Yup.

271
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:53,670
Since we have some time now,
why don't we take the chance to read our fan mail.

272
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:57,690
From Tokyo N-ward, penname Tama Lover.

273
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,730
Hayate-kun, Nagi-san, and Maria-san, hello.

274
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:01,830
Hello.

275
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,160
Hello.

276
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,040
I always watch Hayate no Gotoku and have lots of fun.

277
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,340
Thank you.

278
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,410
By the way, I saw the profile on the official web page and I was surprised.

279
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,840
Maria-san is only 17...

280
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,770
Yes, I'm 17.

281
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,040
Is there a problem?

282
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,960
You looked so calm, I thought you were over 20.

283
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,640
Maria-san, how about acting like a 17 year old from time to time and say things like "Eww, that, like, so sucks."

284
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,300
Tama Lover! Maria is young! She's young!

285
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:34,960
I mean she's-

286
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,220
I see...

287
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,660
I seem that old?

288
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,320
I'll repeat myself, but I'm 17.

289
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,300
I'm still fresh.

290
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,440
I'm not old. I'm just stressed from the daily workload.

291
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,410
Thanks to you know who.

292
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm sorry. And I'm always grateful to you.

293
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,780
Right, Hayate?

294
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,070
Hey, why aren't you talking?

295
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:02,060
Since most of the characters play the dumb role, in order to make story funny, I play the jab role.

296
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,700
It's only natural, since I have the most common sense.

297
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,730
But then, a small girl sent us a letter like this.

298
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,610
Sure, that's fine. I'm only...

299
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,430
Hayate! Why aren't you speaking?!

300
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,480
Ah, here's the next letter.

301
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,380
From Tokyo K-ward, Sgt. Furuicchi.

302
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,480
I love Maria-san.

303
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,190
Battle!

304
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:46,740
Over the sea, through some dungeons, and after about 100 hours of play time,

305
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:51,590
the Student Council party made it to where the Demon lives.

306
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,010
It's finally the moment of the last battle, where lies the fate of this universe.

307
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:01,090
Demon, The Great Stygian of Abe (Temp)!

308
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,580
Fight us!

309
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,640
Just the way I want it ~tima.

310
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,390
Take the wrath of my ultima te attack.

311
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,170
Press.

312
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,970
Demon has been defeated.

313
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,450
So weak! The Demon's so weak!

314
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,760
You're amazing Hero. Your strike was unseen before ~tima.

315
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,380
I haven't done anything yet.

316
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,850
I can give up now.

317
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,150
I can head to the underworld without regret ~tima.

318
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,670
On a second thought, I don't want to go ~tima.

319
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,720
But I feel like it's okay to go ~tima.

320
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,900
But...

321
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,200
Make up your mind!

322
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,690
This isn't getting dramatic at all.

323
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:53,870
Punishment for not being decisive.

324
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,780
Katsura Hinagiku

325
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,830
And the Student Council Trio

326
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,400
Defeated the Demon as such,

327
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,480
And traveled through time

328
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,580
And made it back to

329
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,520
Reality.

330
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,450
Losing all memory of the adventure

331
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,150
In the game...

332
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,030
Thank you, oh Hero.

333
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,230
Thank you, oh Hakuou Gakuen Student Council.

334
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,270
Some kind of thanks and some kind of finale.

335
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,990
But your battle has only started.

336
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:25,800
Next time, we'll fight for the seat of main character.

337
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,540
It was fun.

338
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,170
It all ended well.

339
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:31,920
Yeah.

340
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,730
Hey! Aren't you forgetting somethin'?

341
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:42,180
I'm sorry. I opened the door without thinking.

342
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,910
What kinda ending is this?!

343
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,670
Haven't we been mistreated recently?

344
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,670
From the beginning.

345
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:54,830
Next week, we'll go back to the main story and give you the heartfelt tale of a butler.

346
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,820
Nagi's

347
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,890
Butler Network!

348
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:37,300
Hayate's missing today, so I'm going to use this section as I like.

349
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,330
Oh no, that's a problem.

350
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,630
Now's the only moment you can be relaxed.

351
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,360
Eh?

352
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,430
Since I'm leading this section today, I'm free to do whatever I want.

353
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:48,190
As fans have requested, I'm going to insert Maria's service shot.

354
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,270
Oh no.

355
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:52,150
Probably nobody wants it, but here's Klaus' bath scene!

356
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:52,880
NO!!!

357
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,320
If you keep doing this, you'll never catch up
with the production schedule.

358
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,270
That is a problem.

359
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,520
Let's not use Klaus anymore.

360
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,820
Bye bye.

361
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:03,860
Nagi, how about you visit the main house where your grandfather is once in a while?

362
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,420
It'd be good to introduce Hayate-kun, too.

363
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,260
Don't wanna.

364
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:09,820
Besides, why go say hi to that old man now?

365
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:13,200
Man, it's been a while since I last met Old Mikado.

366
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,700
I'll rip some cash off of him.

367
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,670
What Saku, you're coming, too?

368
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,360
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

369
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,510
My Life is Priceless.

370
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,780
So your life is worthless, I take it.

371
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,840
An armor surrounds your heart.
