1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,230
When watching TV,

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,740
make sure the room is well lit,

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,910
and watch from a distance.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,950
Got it?

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,800
My name is Klaus Seishirou.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,920
I'm a retired butler who now lives as a farmer in Brazil.

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,110
Hey! I haven't retired yet!

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,190
I will be a Sanzenin butler to the very end!

9
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,730
There's nothing left for you to do.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,480
We even found a replacement for Himegami,
so you don't have anything to worry about, do you?

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,830
How dare an animal try to understand my feelings?!

12
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,740
Doesn't it bother you more that an animal is talking?

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:50,670
That impoverished butler looks like he can handle the selfish lady.

14
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,350
I can't leave it to a rookie like him.

15
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,170
I'm going back to Japan!

16
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,980
I don't think so.

17
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,300
You're going to spend what's left of your time here in Brazil with me.

18
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,990
What? That's...

19
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,260
No, that's...

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,490
Tama! Was that you?

21
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,430
We're starting off with a dream this week?

22
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,750
Now farewell, everyone.

23
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,540
No, a tiger can't possibly talk.

24
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,160
I must be tired.

25
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,690
What's this?

26
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,360
Looking to be a coffee plantation owner in Brazil?

27
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,150
When was this put here?

28
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,470
One who masters being a butler becomes the master of the world.

29
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:41,150
The Butler War that shakes the planet has started!

30
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,790
The kanji for my name is made of "Kura", as in warehouse, and "Usu", as in mortar.

31
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,850
I am pure-bred Japanese!

32
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,710
Perfect temperature.

33
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,820
Ironing the newspaper.

34
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,260
This is a butler's first chore in the morning.

35
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,810
As I thought, postponing the release of
Dragon ***** is causing the stock to drop.

36
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:55,340
I had a strange dream of being an owner of
a coffee bean plantation in Brazil and doing nothing.

37
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,650
Sure.

38
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,220
If you want to retire, go ahead.

39
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,750
What?!

40
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,420
Absolutely not!

41
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,870
I plan on burying my bones with the Sanzenin family!

42
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,240
That was only a dream I had!

43
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,770
According to Freud, a dream is a vision of your hidden desires.

44
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:18,620
So deep down, you feel tired and want to retire.

45
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,570
Th-That's not true!

46
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,130
Besides, what would happen to
the Sanzenin family if I disappeared?

47
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,820
Nothing at all.

48
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,330
Hayate and Maria take care of everyday things.

49
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,380
If it's about asset management, you don't have to worry.

50
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,300
You can't handle IT-related stocks, can you?

51
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,220
Anyway, we'll be fine.

52
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,480
I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away.

53
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,970
Um, Klaus-san?

54
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,240
I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away.

55
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,540
An A* Field. It's a barrier made by the soul.

56
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,550
Maria-san!

57
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,300
I don't understand.

58
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,950
I wonder what happened to Klaus-san; he's so depressed.

59
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,980
Yes. Maybe he suffered a great shock?

60
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,420
I don't know. But I did say that he can retire.

61
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,540
You didn't have to take his dream seriously.

62
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,160
Usually, a butler who served for years would...

63
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,600
...receive a room in the mansion and live like a family member.

64
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,830
He must have been shocked to hear you say retire.

65
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,840
He wouldn't possibly quit because of that!

66
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:36,090
Milady. So you like Klaus-san deep down in your heart.

67
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,440
H-He's only a character who's easy to fool around with.

68
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,490
Then don't tell him to quit.

69
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,960
Right now, he might be getting consumed by the Dirac Sea.

70
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,440
I agree.

71
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,330
Then get a forced salvage operation going or something!

72
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,530
Okay.

73
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,280
What was that giggle about?

74
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,420
I'm coming in.

75
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,370
Chief butler.

76
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,360
Maria. I've resigned from my job.

77
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,970
I will now spend the rest of my life in Brazil.

78
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,530
What? It's obvious she wasn't serious when she said you can retire.

79
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,830
But! But!

80
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,400
If you have your mind made up, then there's nothing I can do.

81
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:18,890
Eh?

82
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,890
I'll let Milady know.

83
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,470
Wait! What Milady said has merit!

84
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,320
There must be a loose end in my heart for me to have a dream of retirement.

85
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,400
I will return to the days when I aimed to becoming a footman!

86
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,380
Footman?

87
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,840
Footmen are people who work under butlers.

88
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,710
So you know, there are no footmen in the Sanzenin.

89
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,850
As a footman, I challenge Ayasaki Hayate to see who can serve Milady better!

90
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,690
Wh-What a roundabout way of doing this.

91
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,990
Way to ruin it.

92
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,460
And I was almost able to go to Brazil.

93
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,390
A fight to see who can serve Milady better?

94
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,680
I don't recall asking for any of this.

95
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,160
It's what Klaus-san started.

96
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,980
Boy! You indeed learned a lot in a short period of time!

97
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,740
But, you have a fatal flaw!

98
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,150
What? Where?

99
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,210
Like how you look so cute when you cross-dress.

100
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,180
Don't worry.

101
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,130
Boy. Butlers are supposed to be their master's shadow.

102
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,580
Yet, you have an attitude like that of a main character.

103
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,230
In fact he is, so there's nothing he can do about that.

104
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,340
I think he's more of a reserved type of main character.

105
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,480
Is that a compliment?

106
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,980
Anyways, for the next 24 hours,
we will use all of our skills as butlers to serve Lady Nagi.

107
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,090
If she finds me inferior to you,

108
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,940
I will leave this mansion!

109
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,180
Okay. I will do my best as to not be rude to the chief butler.

110
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,730
And so the who-can-serve-Milady-better battle started.

111
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:06,740
Boy. Do you know what the most necessary attribute of a butler is?

112
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,390
Maybe like how they're hated in episode one, but they are loved by the final episode,

113
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:16,690
or swapping bodies with the master from a strange cause and solving mysteries?

114
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,970
No!

115
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,090
It's the inspiration to read ahead!

116
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:24,380
You need the strength to read ahead
and understand what the master wants.

117
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,290
A noble's morning starts with a morning tea.

118
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,080
Oh, that's already taken care of.

119
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,800
What?

120
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,630
It's ready, Milady.

121
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,900
Thank you, Hayate.

122
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,990
You fool!

123
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:45,570
In England, it's an important job where they even have a person in charge of making tea!

124
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,260
If you don't know the proper way of making it,
you can't call yourself a butler!

125
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,830
It is a teabag the English royal palace uses.

126
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,230
What?

127
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,460
That sounds nice.

128
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,840
Would you like to use lemon or milk?

129
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,840
Listen! Lemon tea does not exist in England!

130
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,720
The only thing that starts the morning is milk tea prepared by the butler with his fine-tuned pouring skill!

131
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,630
Then I'll go with lemon.

132
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,880
Huh?

133
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,340
The lemon tea you make is great, Hayate.

134
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,940
Thank you very much.

135
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,490
Th-This can't be...

136
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,400
Nagi, go easy on him a little.

137
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,850
No... No... You got it wrong...

138
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,390
So you will go to school today, Milady?

139
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:36,250
Yeah. Since I feel bad fooling around with Klaus too much.

140
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,240
Then why do you?

141
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,290
Klaus and I go back many years.

142
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:45,140
Because we know each other well,
it's fun to fool around with each other.

143
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,860
Right now, we get two extra drumsticks.

144
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,510
And it comes with nuggets, too.

145
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,350
A-Are they low on chicken stock?

146
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,790
Looks like he didn't come chasing us this far.

147
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,090
You're right.

148
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,890
You there!

149
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,090
Be quiet!

150
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,830
Milady!

151
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,040
Th-That's a perfectly polished piece of silverware.

152
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,710
And that's a sign of a professional butler!

153
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,320
SFX: DoGyaaaaan!!

154
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,400
Boy! I quit being human!

155
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,180
Klaus-san!

156
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,350
Y-You're a Sanzenin butler!

157
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,810
Uriiiiiiiiiiii!

158
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:49,730
The origin of the word "butler" comes from "bouteiller", the position of those who take care of wine cellars.

159
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,830
Wine... A vintage wine...

160
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,300
Violet Over Drive!

161
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,970
Bordeaux...

162
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,710
Burgundy!

163
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,840
These are no wines for a drunk to drink!

164
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,000
Zugyuuuuun!

165
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,730
Wait!

166
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,020
Both of them have left.

167
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,120
Yeah...

168
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,770
The best thing to do on a sunny day like this is to skip classes.

169
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:18,470
Thinking that everyone else is studying makes me relax even more.

170
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,220
And things would be perfect if we had a butler who would make tea for us.

171
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,370
Sunlight **** Over Drive!

172
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:28,840
SFX: Dobabababa

173
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:28,970
SFX: Dobabababa

174
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:29,140

00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,370
SFX: Dobabababa

176
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,040
SFX: Dobabababa

177
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,370
A dummy?

178
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,670
Butler ninja skill: Dummy no Jitsu.

179
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,770
She was an unexpected interference.

180
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,730
And now-

181
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,570
M-My back...

182
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,960
Hey! It's Nagi-chan's place's chief butler!

183
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,930
Tomarigi sagashitemasu.

184
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,930
Tomarigi sagashitemasu = I'm searching for a branch to land on.

185
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,900
Suppai Omoide daze.

186
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,900
Suppai Omoide daze = What a sour memory.

187
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,740
Wow!

188
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,030
It's premier cake and tea!

189
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,120
Thanks.

190
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,010
I wanted the people who saved my life to enjoy it.

191
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,930
Thank you.

192
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,450
Itadakimasu.

193
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,040
"Thank you", huh...

194
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,370
A butler is his master's shadow.

195
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:24,720
But inside, they are waiting for that one word of gratitude.

196
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,630
It's better than what we find at the store by the train station.

197
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,970
This tea is fabulous, too.

198
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:30,800
It's exquisite.

199
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,860
I found you!

200
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,010
Katsura-chan!

201
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:33,810
Yukiji!

202
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,100
There's a reason behind this.

203
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,880
Whatever, I don't care!

204
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,670
Give me some, too!

205
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,050
What are you talking about?

206
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,370
Don't play dumb with me!

207
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,280
You have some vintage wine, don't you?

208
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,410
Yukiji looks dangerous.

209
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:48,410
Yeah...

210
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,860
Onee-chan!

211
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,670
Why are you being violent against the elderly?

212
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,020
"Elderly"?!

213
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,440
He came falling from the sky a while ago.

214
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,280
He's an old man to whom no one knows what may happen at any moment.

215
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,780
RIP.

216
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,440
You're right, but...

217
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,030
K-Klaus-san?

218
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,890
How far did he go?

219
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,210
Well, I'm sure Klaus has recovered from it by now.

220
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,790
Klaus-san!

221
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:28,820
Oh, if it isn't Klaus-san, a legendary figure in the butler world.

222
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,500
If I'm right, you must be the Oukouchi family's butler.

223
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,810
I'm Saeki Himuro.

224
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,030
And this is Sir Taiga.

225
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,130
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

226
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,010
What?

227
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:45,700
Traditionally, it is the butler's pride
to be called under their master's name.

228
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,660
The Oukouchi's butler doesn't even know that?

229
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,190
Really, Himuro?

230
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,190
Sir, the flowers.

231
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,610
Yes!

232
00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:01,140
It's the Heisei era, and you speak like Edward.

233
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,460
It's sad to see the famous butler aging.

234
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,850
It's sad for you to cling to your former status.

235
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,740
Y-You're amazing, Himuro!

236
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:22,120
With your reflexes, you can't protect your master in an emergency.

237
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,390
How about you retire and think of a new life for yourself?

238
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,380
You're still young, Oukouchi butler.

239
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,680
What?

240
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,510
I am my master's shadow.

241
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,370
A shadow does not have a private life to begin with.

242
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:43,290
When you realize you can't be of aid to
your master anymore, you just disappear.

243
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,640
You don't think...

244
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,530
...he decided to retire because of that, do you?

245
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,410
What?

246
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,530
Is he serious?

247
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,460
Isn't there any way to have Klaus-san stay?

248
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,580
There is a hidden trick.

249
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,910
Really?

250
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:15,270
Yes, but you'll have go through a little change.

251
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:19,260
Surely you mean lend a little hand.

252
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,900
I-I've got a bad feeling...

253
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,890
Everything is all a memory now.

254
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:39,030
My life was spent with these Sanzenin
and my bones were supposed to be buried here.

255
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,460
But what the Oukouchi's young butler says has merit.

256
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,690
It's about time I step down.

257
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,500
Klaus-san.

258
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,600
Y-You're from sometime ago...

259
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,920
You're the pillar of my heart I saw in the garden sometime ago!

260
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,570
I'm such a genius.

261
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,290
Hayate-kun's feminine sex appeal really works.

262
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,360
I'm sure Klaus-san will feel better after this.

263
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,370
W-What is your name?

264
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,610
Ayasaki-

265
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,950
Ayasaki?

266
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,770
I'm Hermione.

267
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,960
Oh, Hermione!

268
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:38,310
What a fantastic name! Sounds like you can use magic.

269
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:44,560
Yes... In fact, I'm a goddess that resides in Lake Sanzenin.

270
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,650
Oh, I knew you weren't an ordinary woman.

271
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,390
Klaus-san. I've always been watching you from the bottom of the lake.

272
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,970
R-Really?

273
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,370
You must not quit the chief butler position.

274
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:03,220
You're not that old yet.

275
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,640
What's the matter?

276
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,860
I've become so old my hair is all white.

277
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,770
That's not true.

278
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,810
It's a nice romantic grey.

279
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,820
Y-You think so, too?

280
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,430
People often say that to me
at Ikebukuro's adult social gatherings.

281
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,140
Then you won't think about retiring, will you?

282
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,390
But lately, my shoulders have been getting stiff, and I can't keep them up.

283
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,690
I-I'm sure it can be massaged off.

284
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,570
See?

285
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,700
Look how hard it is.

286
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,670
Can you do my back and waist, too?

287
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,840
Sure.

288
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,100
Yes, right there. That's where I like it.

289
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,050
Be convinced already, you egghead geezer.

290
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,580
Who is Klaus talking to?

291
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,120
More to this side.

292
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,010
No, I can't touch there.

293
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,130
I-Itadakimasu!

294
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,500
Hermione-san... I-I've...

295
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,180
Honey!

296
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,290
I've aged enough to hallucinate, huh?

297
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,240
It had the reverse effect...

298
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,510
This stupid tiger.

299
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,120
What is this?

300
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,600
Forgive me!

301
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,160
Tama... Don't tell me you were after this female tiger...

302
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,980
I fell in love with her.

303
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,320
But as a tiger, I can't go to Brazil alone.

304
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,470
That's why you tried to use Klaus-san?

305
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,660
You will want to go to a plantation in Brazil.

306
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,500
You want to go... You want to go...

307
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,080
That's all I said!

308
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,600
Let me tell you one thing.

309
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,940
Tiger's don't exist in Brazil!

310
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:12,760
Oh yeah. I'll tell him the dream of Brazil he had isn't because of his underlying mental state, but Tama's planning.

311
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:19,500
No, I can't. Nobody knows that Tama can talk.

312
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:03,390
Klaus! What's the language of flowers for this?

313
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,320
It's loyalty to my Milady.

314
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,480
Really?

315
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,950
Yes. I just decided.

316
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,730
I'll give this to you!

317
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,980
Lady Nagi...

318
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,050
Klaus-san.

319
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,590
Klaus-san.

320
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,680
It's okay, boy.

321
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,880
There isn't anything that you can't do that I can.

322
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,150
Hey, Hayate!

323
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,310
Lady Nagi.

324
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:44,960
Today's Butler Economics and Industry Newspaper is drenched in morning dew!

325
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,790
I can't read the stock market section well!

326
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:56,020
Chief butler. I've yet to learn how to iron the newspaper.

327
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,050
Boy!

328
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:01,120
If you can't even iron a newspaper, then Klaus wins the match.

329
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,540
Milady!

330
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,710
Get moving, Klaus!

331
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,320
You leave me no choice.

332
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,690
Perfect temperature.

333
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,620
Looks like Klaus-san has recovered.

334
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,200
Yes.

335
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,530
Thanks to you, Milady.

336
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,870
He is part of the Sanzenin family.

337
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,510
I don't want to be the one who kicked him out.

338
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,010
How about I make some lemon tea?

339
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:39,980
That sounds good.

340
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,660
Next week, instead of fighting,
we'll try to coexist with small animals.

341
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,460
Wataru and,

342
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:31,960
Saki's,

343
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,060
Butler Network!

344
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,910
A bright smile and ample stock.

345
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,770
I'm the manager of Rental Video Tachibana, Tachibana Wataru.

346
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,480
And I take care of him.

347
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,630
His maid, Kijima Saki.

348
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:46,190
Now that we have the store's image song,
how about we make some merchandising goods next?

349
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,770
But what would appeal to the public?

350
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:53,790
How about giving out the happy-embarrassing photo of Video Tachibana's cult maid, Saki,

351
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:56,310
since we've seen people coming to see you recently?

352
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,630
Stop joking, Sir!

353
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,920
TA-CHI-BANA.

354
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,350
Hayate. What type of girls do you like?

355
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,960
Well, let's see...

356
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,360
I guess normal girls.

357
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:08,950
Normal?

358
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,880
I don't think someone like you would understand.

359
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,170
Don't make fun of me! Are you saying that I can't be your ideal kind of girl?

360
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,810
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

361
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:20,610
I Want to Return to Being a Normal Girl. But Do Buy my Character Song.

362
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:23,510
I see. So Hayate-kun likes normal girls.

363
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:28,650
Did you know, in Okinawa, the statues of lions you see at lion mansions are of Shisa.
