1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,380
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:09,990
Got it?

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,300
Thank you for your hospitality.

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,040
You're very welcome.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,600
Come visit us again.

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,100
Isumi, do you feel like getting lost for another night?

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,360
But...

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,640
I need you!

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,920
If we part now, there's a chance that we'll never meet again in this life!

10
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,370
We can meet again if you come to school, too.

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,330
She even has a friend that would ask her to come.

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,550
I need to do something so Milady can commute to school joyfully.

13
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,450
Hayate!

14
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,170
Y-Yes?!

15
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,060
What do you think the meaning of life is?

16
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,670
M-Must I answer that now?

17
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,500
No, but I feel that one's proof of life shouldn't given by someone else.

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,860
Once you're born a human, there has to be a path of life reserved for each person.

19
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,460
Um, is this going to take long?

20
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,240
That's all I had to say.

21
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,230
Phew.

22
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,350
Well now, the problem's not going to get solved as long as she makes excuses for herself.

23
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,900
To listen to what Milady has to say even in a state of emergency.

24
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,960
Another job as a butler.

25
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,310
Why are you coming in here, too?!

26
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,550
A butler is one who serves.

27
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,020
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

28
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,840
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

29
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,970
Yes.

30
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:05,900
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,200
Please do not watch this episode alone.

32
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,840
Good morning, Milady! It's Hayate!

33
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,780
What do you want so early in the morning?

34
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,190
Milady!

35
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,410
Idiot! What are you doing all of a sudden?

36
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,100
I'll be helping you get dressed.

37
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,700
Walking you to the school isn't enough!

38
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,150
Don't be ridiculous!

39
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,500
How could I get changed in front of you! It's so embarrassing!

40
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,260
Walk me to school?

41
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,200
Yes.

42
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,650
Starting today, I'll be taking you to and from school.

43
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,180
Do you actually think that would make me go back to school?

44
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,530
Actually, not going to school but somewhere else sounds good.

45
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:45,320
What are you saying? A student's job is to study.

46
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,140
You have to attend every day and study hard.

47
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,620
Have a good day, Milady.

48
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,570
Why?

49
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:07,000
You and I will be apart during the time I'm at school,
so why do you want to make me go to school so much?

50
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,190
Because there are those who can't attend even if they want to.

51
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,200
I-I'm sorry.

52
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,160
I'll come pick you up once the school lets out.

53
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:30,180
When our Lady's off to school, the mansion's nice and quiet.

54
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,560
I think it'd be quieter if the tiger didn't talk.

55
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,360
Man, the debt-ridden butler is unsociable.

56
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,770
And speaking of school, don't you have to go?

57
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,510
You were going to a high school
before coming here, weren't you?

58
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,690
I was, but...

59
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:53,840
...having to serve Milady as her butler for the next forty years, I can't go back to school now.

60
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,240
So I have to listen to classes that resemble shitty old games again...

61
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,510
Nagi, hold on.

62
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,280
Why doesn't the blackboard come with a skip function?

63
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,990
Because Japan uses such an old system, their education never-

64
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,880
Wh-What are you-

65
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,360
You mustn't go.

66
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,030
You're not headed towards the academic building.

67
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,870
O-Oh, right.

68
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,080
And it sure is rare that you knew we were headed the wrong way.

69
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,220
Looks like coming to school daily does help.

70
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,830
That's not exactly why, but I can tell.

71
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,620
I won!

72
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,950
Note: あたり (Atari) means "Win"; たたり (Tatari) means "Curse"

73
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,120
I-It's off by a letter.

74
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,090
Hey, I'm home.

75
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,000
What, this is strange.

76
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,770
What's wrong?

77
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,750
Looks like she left a notebook at school.

78
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,870
What?

79
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:09,460
Look! This is what happens when I go to school.

80
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:13,360
It happens only because you go to school ever so rarely.

81
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,580
I'll go get it.

82
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:23,530
I can't let the proof of Milady's day of hard work
lay in an empty classroom.

83
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,810
It's not that important of a thing...

84
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,610
It's getting late, too.

85
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,490
I'm off!

86
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,100
How do I enter the school at night?

87
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,410
An intruder!

88
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,410
Um, hey!

89
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:54,350
You're the former intruder,
the Sanzenin butler who saved my life, umm...

90
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,650
It's Ayasaki Hayate.

91
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,650
And you were a teacher here...

92
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,970
Katsura Yukiji.

93
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,500
Wait, what are you doing here?

94
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,430
I was dodging an attack from behind.

95
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,580
And what are you doing here?

96
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,640
Ah, me?

97
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm the POD.

98
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,000
Note: POD stands for "Person on Duty"

99
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:17,150
Ah, I see, that's perfect. Lady Nagi left a notebook here.

100
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,450
May I borrow the key to the classroom?

101
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,430
The key to the classroom?!

102
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,070
You're going to follow me to the POD room?

103
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,450
Yes, since I don't want to bother you too much.

104
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,760
I'll get it for you, so wait here.

105
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,510
No, I'll get it myself.

106
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,590
Don't open it without a warning!

107
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:46,170
This POD room is stuffed with the life of a woman in her mid-twenties.

108
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,870
Not at all! I've taken lots of personal stuff out.

109
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,320
Do you perhaps live here?

110
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,210
D-Don't blame me!

111
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:59,210
I don't have enough money to pay for rent,
and the bath tub here is bigger and cleaner.

112
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,820
Besides, I don't need you, an outsider, to be asking me about that!

113
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,140
Hey, hey.

114
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,860
Katsura-chan's taking a guy into the POD room.

115
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,910
And he's younger than her, too.

116
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,810
Indecency revealed; getting sacked for sure.

117
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,870
Nothing but that!

118
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,330
My salary!

119
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,520
You're misunderstanding us!

120
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,420
And that poor man's face, I recall seeing it somewhere...

121
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,560
I'm the Sanzenin butler, Ayasaki Hayate.

122
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,420
The one who broke into school and...

123
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,900
...flirted with the student council president, but got dumped and kicked in the face...

124
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:37,820
...and thus tried to lock her up in the student council room, but the plan failed due to Yukiji's brave actions.

125
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,950
The Sanzenin butler!

126
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,580
I think a really incorrect story's being told here.

127
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,300
It's your imagination.

128
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,730
I'm the student council chairman, Segawa Izumi.

129
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,930
Nice to meet you!

130
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,010
The vice-chairman, Hanabishi Miki.

131
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,440
Disciplinary committee, Asakaze Risa.

132
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,650
Student Council? Then they're Katsura-san's friends?

133
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,170
What are you doing here?

134
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,360
Err, err, Hayata-kun?

135
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,830
It's Hayate.

136
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,280
I'm here to pick up a notebook Lady Nagi forgot.

137
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,360
I see.

138
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,000
By the way, Hayata-kun,
we're here for a study group for midterms.

139
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,720
Just as she said, Hayata-kun.

140
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,330
Hayata's fine...

141
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,840
But to have a study group so late at night; you must all be hard workers.

142
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:31,310
If we truly were hard workers,
we wouldn't be studying here, Hayata-kun.

143
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,350
But isn't Hakuou a prestigious school?

144
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,850
Only some students are wicked smart ones.

145
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,570
That's what the transfer and the grade skipping system we have is for.

146
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:43,310
The backbone is an escalator system where you don't drop out unless something major happens.

147
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,210
All the way from elementary school to high school.

148
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:48,330
People like us that have been here since elementary school are...

149
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,500
...genuine idiots!

150
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,950
So much so that we could drop out from the something major happening.

151
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,370
Do you get it?

152
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,890
And I'm teaching them.

153
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,640
Katsura-chan's teaching is so easy to understand.

154
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,150
Oh, stop it.

155
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:07,750
It's a great proof that good teachers are good PODs.

156
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,880
Exactly.

157
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,180
Wait, is that a compliment?

158
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,750
Don't worry, I'm ridiculing you.

159
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,090
Don't make fun of teachers!

160
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,040
They look like they're having fun.

161
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,090
Here.

162
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,050
The key to the classroom.

163
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,370
Make sure you come return it, Hayata-kun.

164
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:24,390
You do know my name, right?

165
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:30,160
But you're definitely a boy to have the courage to go to the west wing at this hour.

166
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,400
Yeah.

167
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,700
Yeah, yeah.

168
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,150
Um, does that mean...

169
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,060
Well, it is an old school.

170
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,570
So a lot of them will appear.

171
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,430
Don't bring a curse back with you!

172
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:50,260
Make sure to defeat Sada** or Kaya** or Jaso* or Fre*** if they were to appear.

173
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,570
They're playing with me since it's not their business.

174
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:03,370
Besides, it's the building they always go to, so such things can't possibly come out.

175
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,540
Wait, wait! It looks way different from last time I was here!

176
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,280
Well, since I've come all this way, might as well as go in.

177
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,570
Through the red door.

178
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,540
Ika ha ikaga? = Would you like squid?

179
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,540
Ika ha ikaga?

180
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,830
Gattsuri itadakimasu = I'll take a whole lot

181
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,830
Gattsuri itadakimasu

182
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,750
Cell phone?

183
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,170
Oh yeah, Maria-san gave it to me.

184
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,150
Hello?

185
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,560
Hey Hayate. How's it going?

186
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,420
I just made it to inside the building.

187
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,920
What's wrong all of a sudden?

188
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,580
Oh, I'm sorry.

189
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,430
But the school at night is dangerous, so...

190
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,300
...I was worried for you.

191
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,750
Thank you very much.

192
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,740
I was relieved to hear your voice, too.

193
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:23,410
I thought you were alone, but I hear lots of voices in the background, so there must a group with you.

194
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,180
People's voices you say?

195
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,100
Yeah, I hear a lot in the background.

196
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,790
But it's not a haunted house,
so they don't have to yell so loudly.

197
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,510
Well, good luck.

198
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,610
Milady!

199
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,070
Milady!!!

200
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,970
I've got to hurry to the classroom.

201
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,810
He's not coming back, is he?

202
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:05,920
Well, school at night tends to have
the lustrous flutes and gym shorts that seduce men.

203
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,360
He may be a butler, but he's a guy before that.

204
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,510
He must be rustling through Hina-chan's desk and working on the flute right now.

205
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,970
Aren't you all having fun!

206
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,440
What's the topic of discussion?

207
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,020
President.

208
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,780
Hina, when did you come?

209
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,080
I came all the way to bring a care package. Are you guys taking this seriously?

210
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,900
Don't worry, we were having a serious discussion about the perverted nature of boys who've hit puberty.

211
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,860
Huh?

212
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,140
As a result, Hina's flute must belong to Hayata-kun now!

213
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,920
That's right!

214
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,520
Get back to studying!

215
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,200
Or maybe Hayata-kun made a mistake and got lost in the old building.

216
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,190
The old building?

217
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,150
That's entirely possible!

218
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,960
That's a problem. That building is-

219
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,030
What?

220
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,570
Hakuou Academy has ghosts?

221
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,440
Yes. They apparently appear in the old building.

222
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,170
But that school would probably hire Ghostsweepers.

223
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,580
What are we going to do if Hayate goes in there by mistake?

224
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,220
Hayate! Answer me, Hayate!

225
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,220
What? Hayate-kun from Sanzenin went to that old building?

226
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,860
It's only a possibility, and we're not sure if he got lost or not.

227
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,250
I'll go search for him.

228
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,270
It's dangerous, Hina-chan.

229
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:21,140
A person unrelated to the school might be in danger on campus.

230
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,780
I can't leave the matter alone.

231
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,470
Ghosts might appear, though.

232
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,410
Don't worry. I'm not scared of ghosts and such.

233
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,430
That sure is Hina.

234
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,380
My sister is a waste to keep as a girl.

235
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,060
That said...

236
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,570
Anyway, I must find Hayate-kun fast.

237
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,880
Come to think of it, why is it so bright here?

238
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,670
That scream was...

239
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,270
The cell phone's...

240
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,600
Weren't you not scared of ghosts?

241
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,640
Where would you find a girl that can stand up to that?!

242
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,750
I'm told that the floating fires are
balls of plasma that can be scientifically explained.

243
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,220
You can't explain fear!

244
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,460
Then here's the last question.

245
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:22,860
Who's been asking you questions for the past few seconds?

246
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,040
S-Someone...

247
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,010
Someone!!!

248
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,470
Are you all right?

249
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,090
You're the student council president, Katsura-san.

250
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,520
K-Katsura-san?

251
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,480
Thank you for saving me.

252
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,380
But...

253
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,740
...don't get lost in such a scary place!!!

254
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,670
Oh, this is the old building?

255
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,200
No wonder something was strange.

256
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,390
Keep that a secret, okay, Hayate-kun?

257
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:09,950
Eh?

258
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:15,420
If you tell anyone that I was seriously scared,
I'll hit you with all my might.

259
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,150
I think you had lots of might in the first one.

260
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,770
Anyways, let's hurry up and get out of here.

261
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,030
What are you saying, Hayate-kun?

262
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,490
You think I can leave here defeated?

263
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,900
But I have to go get Milady's notebook.

264
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,600
No!

265
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,310
We're going to find out who's doing this.

266
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,580
Katsura-san!

267
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,210
Call me Hinagiku!

268
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,540
Please wait, Katsura-san!

269
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,730
Something has to be done.

270
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:58,050
Katsura-san's just like Milady after all. So stubborn.

271
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,690
It's so hot.

272
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:14,140
Oh, so you're actually conscious of the fact you're alone with a girl at school at night?

273
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,700
I-I'm not particularly conscious of you.

274
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,860
Not particularly?

275
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,620
Besides, you're too forward.

276
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,640
You need to have a little more modesty in front of boys.

277
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,380
With an aggressive attitude, no matter what boys do, you can't-

278
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,090
Fine.

279
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,840
If it's you, I don't mind what you do.

280
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,930
K-Katsura-san?

281
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:45,660
Would boys take it seriously when I make jokes like that?

282
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,470
Thank you for the warning.

283
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,780
I'll be sure to watch out for boys like you from now on.

284
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,610
I thought she was as stubborn as Milady, but I was wrong.

285
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,010
She's more stubborn than her.

286
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,350
That's the doll I broke a few minutes ago!

287
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,210
You're joking!

288
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:05,920
Tada.

289
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,970
Go home, you humans.

290
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:11,860
If you don't, I-I'll eat you all.

291
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,510
Don't take the Hakuou Academy's student council president, Katsura Hinagiku, so lightly.

292
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,980
It's not fair to attack so suddenly.

293
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,340
Anyways, Hayate-sama.

294
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:28,350
Please leave here... I mean get out!

295
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,820
The humiliation I received earlier, I'll return it to you a hundredfold.

296
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,430
Take that!

297
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,960
"Hayate-sama"?

298
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,570
I don't understand why, but maybe this is a simple threat just because she wants us out of here?

299
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:56,810
Katsura-san, let's forget about
that fearsome monster and get out of here!

300
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,650
Call me Hinagiku.

301
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,870
Anyway, I'm going to defeat this.

302
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:09,250
What? Don't say you need to defeat that thing "oh so wonderfully", and let's get out of here!

303
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,450
Don't worry, Hayate-kun.

304
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,510
If you don't get scared, this isn't that strong.

305
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,930
I am strong!

306
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:22,660
I am strong, so I'll kill you all, humans!

307
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,300
Even if you transform, you're still no match for me.

308
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,270
You got me.

309
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,390
But I haven't done anything yet.

310
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,300
Yikes.

311
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:41,120
Th-That was amazing, Katsura-san.
To defeat the sprit with only your mind.

312
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,940
That must have been what people refer to as chi.

313
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,590
Like the sort of thing that masters use.

314
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,480
You must have used it unconsciously.

315
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,960
You're so amazing, Katsura-san.

316
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,090
It's hard to accept the theory.

317
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:56,610
Now, since we were able to defeat the ghost, let's hurry out of-

318
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,810
You're going to go get Nagi's notebook, right?

319
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,530
Let's hurry on.

320
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,290
Yes, Katsura-san.

321
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,500
Call me Hinagiku.

322
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,500
Yes, Hinagiku-san.

323
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,790
They're finally off.

324
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,250
Yes.

325
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,960
Now, let's do away with the real ghosts.

326
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,490
Yes, ma'am!

327
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,580
Hayate!

328
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,220
I was worried about you! Did you get possessed by any spirits?

329
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,970
I'm fine.

330
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:35,110
School's a nice place.

331
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,650
School life is so far away now.

332
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,530
What does the indebted butler think?

333
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:44,130
And next time, an accident that nobody has imagined will happen.

334
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,650
We'll be fighting against an emergency.

335
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:50,060
Or rather, we'll have no choice but to fight it.

336
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,790
Get back to studying!

337
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:30,910
Nagi and...

338
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,760
Hayate's...

339
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,290
Butler Network!

340
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,370
Nice to meet you, I'm Sanzenin Nagi.

341
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,550
I'm Ayasaki Hayate.

342
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,630
Today, we have Maria-san as our guest.

343
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,050
Nice to meet you. I'm Maria.

344
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,840
This song is so soothing.

345
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,260
As expected from Maria-san.

346
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,070
Thank you very much, Hayate-kun.

347
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,610
Stop flirting again, Hayate.

348
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:50,380
Oh?

349
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:54,000
All right then! I'll get working
on becoming a soothing type of girl!

350
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,400
Milady, you're best as you are now.

351
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,490
Really? If you say so.

352
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,720
Bye bye.

353
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:04,290
Maria, I remember seeing this scene before...

354
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,910
Next time is the same as episode eight.

355
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:10,570
Then we can see the cat-ear Hayate from another angle?

356
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:14,340
Not only that, but it is an anime original story.

357
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,790
That's filled with expectations and anxiety.

358
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,440
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

359
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,670
The World's Bizarre High Deflation.
Don't Stack Up Games and Play Them.

360
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,310
Sir Hero! Please come fast!

361
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,380
I'm on fire!
