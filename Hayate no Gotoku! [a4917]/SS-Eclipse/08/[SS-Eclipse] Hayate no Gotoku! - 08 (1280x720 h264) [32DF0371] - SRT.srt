1
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,480
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:09,990
Got it?

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,660
Man, I'm full.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,060
No matter how many times I eat it, Maria-san's cooking's great.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,800
You're eating too much even for that.

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,140
Listen. You need energy to do comedy.

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,770
You need to have strength.

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,740
If you don't eat well, you can never get people to laugh.

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,410
I never intend to make people laugh.

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,610
If you're done eating, then get yourself out of here.

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,850
I will without needing you to tell me.

12
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,540
Unlike you, I properly go to school.

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,960
Makita! Kunieda!

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,280
I'm off to school now!

15
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,360
"School", "school". Whatever.

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,110
If you don't start getting ready, you'll be late.

17
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,380
Don't be ridiculous; Isumi's still sleeping.

18
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,300
I can't leave a guest behind and go to school.

19
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,370
Oh, so that's your excuse today?

20
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,210
It must be hard to have so many reasons why you can't go to school.

21
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,340
Why do you want to make me go to school so badly?

22
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,730
If I go to school...

23
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,940
...I can't spend time with you...

24
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,040
A butler is one who serves.

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,990
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

26
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:21,490
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

27
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,520
Yes.

28
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:31,150
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

29
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,670
Come to think of it, I had forgotten that Nagi was fond of Hayate-kun.

30
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,110
Oh no!

31
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,690
Seriously, why is Hayate so...

32
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,760
Why doesn't he understand that I want to stay with him as much as time allows?

33
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,410
He's so dense.

34
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,850
Cleaning~ Cleaning~ It's so fun~

35
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,930
So you like cleaning, Hayate-kun?

36
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,390
Huh? Ah, yes.

37
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,720
Then is your type older or younger girls?

38
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,500
Um...

39
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,170
You mean my ideal type?

40
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,370
Yes.

41
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,060
Since Nagi and Hayate-kun's relationship started with a misunderstanding,

42
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,910
I need to clearly confirm Hayate-kun's feelings once.

43
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:56,180
Does this mean the path to the Maria-san ending
in this anime has opened?

44
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,240
Definitely older girls.

45
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,890
I think younger girls are cute,
but they won't be the target of any relationships.

46
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,120
Oh, really?

47
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,460
Her reaction seems rather disappointed.

48
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,640
What's going on?

49
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,300
Hey, Hayate!

50
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,490
Come up here for a second!

51
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,350
Yes, right away!

52
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,740
I'm sorry; we'll talk about this later.

53
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,150
So Nagi-chan's absent today, too.

54
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,360
That reminds me. The intruder in black
from the other day was the new Sanzenin butler.

55
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,490
I only got a glimpse, but he was a young guy, wasn't he?

56
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,150
Yup. He was handsome.

57
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,320
You think?

58
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,290
I don't recall that.

59
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,460
Then let's go check him out again.

60
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,370
Could you put these clothes on?

61
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,750
That's, without any mistake, for girls, right?

62
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,530
Don't worry; the size is correct.

63
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,240
That's not what I'm worried about.
Why am I going to wear a girl's outfit?

64
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,810
Why?

65
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:03,950
Because you'll probably look good in it.

66
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,370
So it's on your whim?!

67
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,840
Yes, it is on a whim, but if I don't come up
with an excuse, I can't be with you.

68
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,720
Augh!

69
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,320
Stop whining and put this on already!

70
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,240
No! Please stop! No!

71
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,630
You're so mean to make me wear this sailor uniform.

72
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,790
You look great in it.

73
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,710
It doesn't make me happy at all!

74
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,490
Oh right! Camera!

75
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,900
No, please!

76
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,110
You can't take pictures of this!

77
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,310
What's wrong about it! Got to put it in the album.

78
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,780
Why?

79
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,800
Besides, if the head butler sees me in this, I'll get fired!

80
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,350
What do you mean?

81
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,210
Allow me to explain.

82
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:50,830
It turns out that Hayate was taught
the heart of butlering by Klaus a few days ago again.

83
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,000
A butler must act like a man.

84
00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:01,610
Do you understand? As a Sanzenin butler,
you must always be a gentleman and manly.

85
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,750
Because the world seeks for equality between
men and women, we have to be manly to fill the gap.

86
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,470
If you can't do that, I will have you out of here instantly.

87
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,280
Oh, Klaus said that?

88
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,520
So I can't have Klaus-san see me in this!

89
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,380
Not only Klaus-san.

90
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,060
Maria-san, too...

91
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,950
If she sees me in this, I'll die from embarrassment.

92
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,230
Oh my, what should I do then?

93
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,940
Having you die because of me is a bit of a problem.

94
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,220
M-Maria-san!

95
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,300
I was wondering what you two were up to, but...

96
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,140
No! Milady forced this on me!

97
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,890
Hayate insisted on trying it on.

98
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:39,710
No, I didn't!

99
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,950
Don't worry; I don't believe that you have a secret hobby of cross dressing.

100
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,720
Thank goodness. I was worried that you'd misunderstand me.

101
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,690
Anyways, you're so mischievous.

102
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,110
But I thought Hayate would look good in it.

103
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,960
Even so, a sailor uniform?

104
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,030
She's right! I'm a guy!

105
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:07,790
Hayate-kun would look better in this frill.

106
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,440
Maria-san!

107
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,990
Maria! Then how about coordinating it with this skirt?

108
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,350
What? Wouldn't it be cuter to put pink with this?

109
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,590
How about red then?

110
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,730
Actually, this blue one looks good, too.

111
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,270
Oh no. They're both in high school girl mode.

112
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,120
My purity is in jeopardy.

113
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,870
What do you think about this, Maria?

114
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,790
That looks good.

115
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,030
Slowly...

116
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,920
Where are you going?

117
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,300
You can't walk around the house in that sailor uniform, can you?

118
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,100
But... I have work to do.

119
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,340
How admirable.

120
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,280
But let's say that this is part of your work, too.

121
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,810
Let's try these clothes on, too.

122
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,450
You're horrible.

123
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,650
Th-This is...

124
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,190
It's beyond a joke.

125
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,930
If Klaus-san sees me in this, I'll really get fired!

126
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,250
Don't worry about it.

127
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,860
And stop looking at me with those eyes.

128
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,970
Really, you're embarrassing me.

129
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,180
I'm the one that's embarrassed!

130
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,690
But you really do look great in it.

131
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,170
You think so, too, don't you, Tama?

132
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,810
T-Tama, no, don't!

133
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,190
Even if you're an animal, you can't engage in something we can't show in anime!

134
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:45,000
Stop it! You weigh 300kg! You'll kill me!

135
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,810
Allow me to explain for the kids who are watching this anime for the first time.

136
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:53,750
This tiger, referred to as Tama, can speak the human language.

137
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,510
And don't ask why he can.

138
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,880
Maria, is Tama on Hayate thinking he's a cute feline?

139
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,240
Or is Tama on him knowing he's a cute guy?

140
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,250
I'm not sure.

141
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:10,280
Depending on how it is, I'm thinking of changing Tama's training program.

142
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,020
But I think Hayate-kun is going to die while we discuss this.

143
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,780
Tama, stop it.

144
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,020
Oh come on! Just a little!

145
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,040
That's enough out of you!

146
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,110
You stupid tiger.

147
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,710
He took out Tama in one move.

148
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,790
He may look like a girl, but he's a monster inside.

149
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,180
Anyway, I must get changed immediately.

150
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,480
If Klaus-san sees me in this-

151
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,000
What a nice weather out today.

152
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:48,600
On a day like this, the best thing to do is to give
the original language of flowers to the flowers in the yard.

153
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,020
What is that about?

154
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,240
Forget that, I need to get out of here.

155
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,810
Who is this stranger walking in
the Sanzenin yard without permission?

156
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,630
Can't possibly say, "It's me, Hayate."

157
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,210
All that's left is...

158
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,160
How foolish. You think you can get away from me in this mansion?

159
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,310
Now that's the Klaus I know.

160
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,370
He's keeping up with Hayate-kun's speed.

161
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,180
Oh no, he'll eventually catch up with me at this rate.

162
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,300
I'll have to hide my face with the ribbon and fight back.

163
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,770
Crap, I can't see anything.

164
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,510
But in emergencies, humans can awaken their hidden powers.

165
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,610
Don't try to look. Believe the mind's eye!

166
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,280
Klaus Kick!

167
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,050
That was impossible, after all.

168
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,430
Die, intruder.

169
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,810
What do you think you're doing going into heat all of a sudden?!

170
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,210
I'm sorry, Klaus-san. I'm really sorry.

171
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,650
Change into these while you can.

172
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,940
Thank you very much.

173
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,920
No, I'm sorry for getting carried away, as well.

174
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,390
No, you're so kind, Maria-san.

175
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,330
I'm very grateful to you.

176
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,620
Thank you very much, Maria-san.

177
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,990
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be here.

178
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,730
What's wrong with him saying, "Maria-san", "Maria-san"?

179
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,260
Hayate, get changed already!

180
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,930
Otherwise, I'll throw the pictures we took earlier into the air.

181
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,940
What? Please, no.

182
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,440
I'm only joking.

183
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,480
Looks like Nagi-chan has a new maid, as well.

184
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,300
Now that's the Sanzenin family for you.

185
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,570
But that's a really cute maid.

186
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,220
And they look occupied, so let's go home.

187
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,620
Yeah, besides lunch break is almost over.

188
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,300
Forget about afternoon classes.

189
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:11,580
How the student council trio were able to get inside the high security Sanzenin territory is a mystery.

190
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,080
Who was that beautiful girl?

191
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,670
If I could see her again, I want to tell her how I feel.

192
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,960
Hayate's misfortunes continue.

193
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,600
Mucchini Sukebe = Passive Pervert

194
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,600
Mucchiri Sukebe!

195
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,970
Betsu ni sawatta dakejya nai = I only touched you

196
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,970
Betsu ni sawatta dakejya nai.

197
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,050
Ooh, so hot.

198
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,910
Come to think of it, I wonder how Ayasaki-kun's doing.

199
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,430
Oww.

200
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:52,580
Man, Tama jumps on top of me... and Klaus-san kicks me...

201
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,910
I'm covered with scratches.

202
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,460
I'm sorry for you.

203
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,990
Isumi-san! What are you doing here?

204
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,250
Well, when I woke up, I was lost.

205
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,060
Thanks to that, I am exhausted now.

206
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,540
I'm sorry for you, too.

207
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,860
Your lack of a sense of direction is amazing.

208
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,140
How many times have you come to my house?

209
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,820
Sanzenin Mansion, the fearful labyrinth where you get lost no matter how many times you visit.

210
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,770
Don't treat us like a haunted house.

211
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,920
Well, the night has fallen,

212
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,930
so how about staying over another night?

213
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,180
I'll give a call to your house.

214
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,090
I'm sorry for the trouble.

215
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,920
Well, good night.

216
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,070
Good night.

217
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,580
Isumi-san didn't see me cross-dressing, did she?

218
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,440
Mustn't worry. Mustn't worry.

219
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,370
I'll just go to bed.

220
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,320
Not going to bed yet?

221
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:09,550
No, I usually sleep with Nagi, as she typically won't go to bed alone because she's scared...

222
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,930
...but since Isumi-san is here tonight, too...

223
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,730
So you're relieved of your usual role.

224
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,610
Yes.

225
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,650
So you play billiards?

226
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,860
Well, yes.

227
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,010
Would you like to play a game?

228
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,880
Besides, I think I can have a good conversation with him right now.

229
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:29,640
This following the conversation in the morning...

230
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,350
Did the path to the Maria-san ending really open?

231
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:37,140
And the reason why today was filled with misfortune was a build up to this moment of happiness?

232
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:41,680
And Hayate will be regretting his optimistic illusion in a while.

233
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,160
Then let us begin.

234
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,490
Yes.

235
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,100
Milady is really close with Isumi-san, isn't she?

236
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:51,020
Isumi-san is special to Nagi.

237
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,070
The two met at a party eight years ago.

238
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,110
What's this doodle?

239
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,390
It's not a doodle, Saku Nee-chan!

240
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,880
It's a manga that I'm working on.

241
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,160
A manga?

242
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,740
Is this Ri***man-like figure the enemy?

243
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,180
That's Helnia-chan, the mascot character!

244
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,120
Are these ancient words from the Inca?

245
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,550
That's the special move, Death Slicer!

246
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:19,490
Either way, stop drawing this boring thing
and come play with us outside.

247
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,990
I'm never going to write another manga.

248
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,110
H-Hey! What are you doing reading it?!

249
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,450
Give it back! Haven't you had enough of a laugh, yet?

250
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,590
Where's the rest?

251
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:50,060
What's going to happen next?

252
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,800
It was very interesting.

253
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,440
That's how they met.

254
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,740
And few seconds later, she goes...

255
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,100
Please marry me!

256
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:06,930
What?

257
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,710
That's how they became best friends.

258
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,030
I see.

259
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:16,610
But Isumi-san's amazing to be able to understand that manga.

260
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,420
Really.

261
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:23,160
I'm sure, right now, Nagi's telling a story that only those two understand.

262
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,070
That's when the infinite-ant-creating machine hidden under Ayers Rock activates.

263
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:36,230
With the ants spreading all over the surface of the world, all the sugar is brought to the Dead General living underground,

264
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:40,940
And the heroes all around the world engage in a battle.

265
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,920
It worries me about her future a little.

266
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,190
By the way, Hayate-kun, where did you pick up billiards?

267
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:52,190
When I was in middle school,
I was working part time at a pool bar.

268
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,150
Is it allowed for underaged children to work at a pool bar?

269
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,090
I guess I shouldn't ask.

270
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,560
Oh yeah, how about we bet something?

271
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,530
That sounds good.

272
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,230
I only intended that as a joke.

273
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,670
Oh why not.

274
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,320
Okay, then what should we bet?

275
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:13,510
How about the loser listens to anything the winner asks for?

276
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,400
Are you sure? This anime is intended for a young audience, mind you.

277
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,930
Um, Hayate-kun, what do you intend to make me do?

278
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,360
Nothing... much...

279
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:30,500
Besides, Hayate-kun, you think you even have a 0.1% chance of winning against me?

280
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,220
Shall we begin?

281
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,900
B-By the way, if I lose, what are you going to make me do?

282
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,390
Oh, let's see...

283
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:56,350
Don't you think the remaining debt of ¥155,823,975 is a bit of a mouthful?

284
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,680
Huh?

285
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:06,530
¥155,823,975 is a bit of a mouthful to say, so wouldn't 200 million be easier?

286
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:14,060
Today's been a horrible day, but judging from where this is going, is Maria-san the last boss of the day?

287
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,540
I can't lose this match!

288
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:21,940
However, with the extreme difference in skill,
Hayate had absolutely no chance.

289
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:30,920
Um, quick question. If I do lose,
how do I pay the 200 million back?

290
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,750
You're right; it's impossible, isn't it?

291
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:39,020
Right, so you're joking about 200 million, right?

292
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,970
Do I look like a kind of person that jokes?

293
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,650
No.

294
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,080
But there is a way to pay it back.

295
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,790
What?

296
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,670
Don't mind. It's your turn.

297
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,590
Ah, y-yes.

298
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,810
I must make a comeback.

299
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:59,150
By the way, the easy way to pay the debt back is...

300
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,220
...marrying Nagi.

301
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,620
What?! Me? Marry Milady?

302
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,350
Oops, you missed.

303
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,100
What, you can't count that...

304
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,220
No stops in a serious match.

305
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:27,800
Now, if I make this, your debt will become 200 million, and you'll have to start hitting on Nagi seriously.

306
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,710
Um, I can't ever marry Milady.

307
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,690
You don't like her?

308
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,980
No, that's not the reason.

309
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,750
If I marry Milady and pay the debt off like that,

310
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:45,130
then that looks as if I married Milady for the sake of money.

311
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,870
It's only a hypothetical story!

312
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:53,330
It's impossible for her to fall in love with lowly me!

313
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:58,140
And even if she did, as a human being, I can't lay my hands on a child!

314
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,070
Seriously!

315
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,840
Milady is my life savior and a very important person.

316
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,850
So I can't ever do that.

317
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,490
Hayate-kun's a really good boy.

318
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:14,520
And here I am, trying to scout his feelings.

319
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,550
It might be for the best to leave it to the two of them.

320
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,580
Um, is something wrong?

321
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,170
Oh, I'm sorry.

322
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,770
Here I go.

323
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,250
Oh my.

324
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,250
All right, looks like I still have a chance.

325
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,790
Yay!

326
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,760
Congratulations! You win.

327
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,520
Then, I can really ask for anything?

328
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,770
Yes, of course.

329
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:58,900
Okay, then I'll ask something on the borderline, considering the kids in the audience.

330
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,570
But...

331
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:04,670
I think you have to deal with the monster standing behind you first.

332
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,630
Milady...

333
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,110
What's with that loose face you've got?

334
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,480
N-No, this really is nothing...

335
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:18,130
Listen Hayate! If you ever lay your hands on Maria, I won't forgive you!

336
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,860
Seriously, when he already has me...

337
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,520
Let's go Isumi!

338
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,830
Good night.

339
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,870
Milday turned out to be the last boss of the day filled with misfortune.

340
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:38,340
So Hayate-kun, what did you want me to do for you?

341
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:43,580
I was hoping you'd forgive me for ruining that expensive coat.

342
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,050
Oh, something so simple?

343
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,450
Yes.

344
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:51,270
The debt-ridden butler has a weak mind.

345
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:54,600
Next week, we'll fight against "it" in the science lab.

346
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,980
Nagi and...

347
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,740
Hayate's...

348
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,390
Butler Network!

349
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,540
This week's Hayate no Gotoku was hilarious, too.

350
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,840
Yeah? But the cels didn't have colors during the dubbing, so I can't say much about it.

351
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,650
It's fine. It'll be colored by the time it goes on air.

352
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,670
I sure hope so.

353
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,770
Rather than that, isn't this a nice song?

354
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,800
It contains my resolution to protect-

355
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,190
We heard that last time, so we know.

356
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,370
Instead, wear this for me.

357
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,030
Wh-What is this outfit?

358
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,350
Manly Hayate is good, but it's hard to give up on this, too.

359
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,780
*Sob* I'm ruined for marriage!

360
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,740
I'll take you, so don't worry.

361
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,880
Bye bye!

362
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,430
What, this is strange.

363
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,820
What's wrong, Milady?

364
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,920
Looks like I left my notebook at school.

365
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,600
What?

366
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,500
Then I'll go get it right away.

367
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,490
No, it's not that important.

368
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,360
I'm off!

369
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,570
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

370
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:19,110
Eloim Essaim. Mr. Cow, Mr. Cow! What is it, Mr. Frog?

371
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,630
What? Hayate-kun from Sanzenin went into that old building?

372
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,940
3x3 Eyes! We shall meet in the land of the Triclops.
