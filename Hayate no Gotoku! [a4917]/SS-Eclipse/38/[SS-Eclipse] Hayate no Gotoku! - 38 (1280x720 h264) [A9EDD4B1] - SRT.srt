1
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,270
When watching TV,

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:06,840
make sure the room is well lit,

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,010
and watch from a distance.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,020
Got it?

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,460
What? Shion, is that true?

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,900
Yes. Although, it is only a rumor.

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,980
I have more money than I want, so it's not as if I wanted more...

8
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,640
...but it's worth a shot as a time killer.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,690
Um, Kuzuha-sama. Those wish tabs are for Tanabata Festival.

10
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,560
One who masters being a butler becomes the master of the world.

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:59,340
The Butler War that shakes the planet has started!

12
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,780
Today's episode will be based on the Milky Way.

13
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,350
No, it's Christmas!

14
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,410
Sneak peek of the final episode, part 1, here we go!

15
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,910
Milady is late, isn't she?

16
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,580
Could she be playing a game in her room?

17
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,470
No, she did participate last year, too, so I don't think she would be.

18
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,460
Besides...

19
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,350
The invitation says this.

20
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,250
If you do not come, I'll distribute your embarrassing picture.

21
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,210
By Sanzenin Mikado.

22
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,760
Milady?

23
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,440
It might be an embarrassing picture from Milady's perspective.

24
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,090
She had to suffer a penalty game since she fell into his trap.

25
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,840
A trap?

26
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,640
I think this particular incident was related to the investment in a game company.

27
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,850
She got caught with the fake information saying Dream**** 100MB Mk3 would be released.

28
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:29,550
We managed to stop with losing only 20 trillion yen.

29
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:34,310
Th-That's considered a trap set by a grandfather against his granddaughter?

30
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,830
Um, who is this butler-like person?

31
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,960
Oh, that would be Himegami-kun.

32
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,730
Nagi's former butler.

33
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,650
Oh, so it's this person?

34
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,720
What is he doing there?

35
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,040
I don't know. Maybe he's searching for a UFO.

36
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,120
Also, he tended to like high places.

37
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,850
I see...

38
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,530
Sorry for making both of you wait.

39
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,200
Milady...

40
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,530
That's the coat I lent you before.

41
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,510
Well, I was wondering what I should wear.

42
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,170
It just happened to catch my eye
when I was going through my closet.

43
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,370
Honestly!

44
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,500
A-hem.

45
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,480
I'm happy to see you all again.

46
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,140
As you see, I'm still up on my two feet.

47
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,870
My condolences to those who are looking forward to inheriting the estate.

48
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,640
Let there be long life to me.

49
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,750
And let there be prosperity to the Sanzenin.

50
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,120
Merry Christmas!

51
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,960
Merry Christmas!

52
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,620
So everybody here is a relative of the Sanzenin family.

53
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,340
Yes. This is an annual gathering done as a way of seeing Grandfather.

54
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:55,470
It was after I snuck out of this party that I met you.

55
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,640
I see.

56
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,890
What are you doing in a corner of the room, Nagi?

57
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,460
It's a party for crying out loud.

58
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,930
Why aren't you looking like you're suffocating?

59
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,780
Merry-

60
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,700
Choking.

61
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,720
Sakuya-san, that's like a fossilized joke.

62
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,750
Perfect.

63
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,700
You've improved a lot.

64
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,630
Thank you very much, Master.

65
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,650
Keep up the good work.

66
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,260
Hey, Ayasaki Hayate.

67
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,710
This voice is...

68
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,790
Next year, please be defeated by me.

69
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,240
Thank you very much.

70
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,210
Aniki! Where did you sneak in from?

71
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,110
You never learn, do you?

72
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,080
I had completely forgotten about it recently, but...

73
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,490
Pass this on to the other candidates, as well.

74
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:45,360
Anyone who wants the Sanzenin estate will have to defeat her butler, Ayasaki Hayate, first!

75
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,060
I'm really glad we're facing the end of the year without anything happening.

76
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,690
Hayate.

77
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,540
You have a poor man's face as usual, don't you?

78
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,200
I don't sense any magnanimity from you.

79
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,910
And, this can is made of steel.

80
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,080
When did you...

81
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,800
That wasn't funny in any way, Gramps.

82
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,750
I matched it to your level.

83
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,100
Well, what's your deal? If it's a party,
then why don't you dress like it's one?

84
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,740
Mikado-sama! Please, give me the estate. I beg you.

85
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,270
So, have you found meaning in your life?

86
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,660
Why can't you give it to me?

87
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,330
Ah, well...

88
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,880
Wow, please stop.

89
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,620
Yes. It is my mission in life to protect Milady.

90
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,160
I've done nothing.

91
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,330
What for?

92
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,800
Well, I have multiple debts to Milady.

93
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,710
First of all, I have a debt of ¥150,000,000.

94
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,560
Hey, old fart! Don't criticize Hayate right after you meet.

95
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,820
Milady.

96
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,390
You should go off and train with Sen****maru for a while.

97
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:49,950
Let's go, Hayate!

98
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,790
Um...

99
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,060
My, my, Grandfather...

100
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,110
Maria. My granddaughter picks on me.

101
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,900
There, there.

102
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,010
Oh, that's right.

103
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,530
Hold on here for a second.

104
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,170
Maria!

105
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,810
Here.

106
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,150
I'm going out for a bit.

107
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,820
Make sure you keep an eye on him.

108
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,260
Thank you, Nagi.

109
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,060
She should say it personally.

110
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,200
That shy granddaughter.

111
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,600
What do you think, Maria?

112
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,320
About Hayate-kun?

113
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,420
He's working out very well.

114
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,180
Nagi likes him, too.

115
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,810
But...

116
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,510
Nagi, Hayate-kun can't accept your feelings yet.

117
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,580
Hayate, don't let what he said bother you.

118
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,580
It's his entertainment in life to harass others.

119
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,250
I see.

120
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,150
On another note, it's not snowing this winter.

121
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,530
It's been a whole year since that day, right?

122
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,430
Yup. Time flies.

123
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,050
Go out with me.

124
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,060
I want you!

125
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,550
It's about time we took the next step, right?

126
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,340
I went all the way and wore this coat.

127
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,850
I'll casually make the motion.

128
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,150
The stars are really beautiful, Hayate!

129
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,400
Yes, they really are.

130
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,800
It's a very romantic Christmas Eve.

131
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:39,060
I bet right now, all the couples are out there gazing up at the evening sky and talking.

132
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,590
After all, the stars are twinkling so much.

133
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,680
You have interest in astronomy, Milady?

134
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,630
Then let me talk about the constellations you see in the winter sky.

135
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,070
First, take a look at the northern sky.

136
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:56,610
You can see the North Star, one of the very basics of astronomy.

137
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,050
Hayate must be embarrassed.

138
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,400
Using the big dipper is famous for finding the North Star,

139
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,320
What a shy guy!

140
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,730
but that's actually the standard during spring and summer.

141
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,890
In winter, you use Cassiopeia.

142
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:11,740
Oh, by the way, I'm used to giving this explanation because I used to work at Nikkou on its 60th-

143
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,160
Wh-What is this noise?

144
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,700
Way to ruin the mood!

145
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,920
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

146
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,040
Maybe it's construction?

147
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,410
I'm a cyborg butler!

148
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,480
A butler newly born to fight against you!

149
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,980
Hayate. Tell me what I'm seeing right now.

150
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,950
Explain to me so that I understand.

151
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,660
Well...

152
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,800
Don't call me Oji-san.

153
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,200
I'm only twenty years old!

154
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,930
I didn't say anything yet!

155
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,890
These strange battle turnarounds... I didn't think they were still going.

156
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,630
Drill Knee!

157
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,570
Hayate.

158
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,000
What do you think you're doing?

159
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,120
Broken Heavy Knuckle!

160
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,200
Fine. I will play with you.

161
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,700
Hey, Hayate.

162
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,750
It'll be dangerous, so please stay back.

163
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,510
Ready, mysterious person?

164
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,010
Look over here.

165
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,730
Hayate?!

166
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,080
My body...

167
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,940
Merry Christmas, Ayasaki Hayate.

168
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,220
Superintendent.

169
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,400
So you were behind this.

170
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:48,000
Um, I don't know what you want,
but can you at least leave us alone during Christmas?

171
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,510
Let go of me, midget!

172
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,130
You stay still, too, midget-midget.

173
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,530
White Snake Forbidden Spell 7.

174
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,770
Butler Killing!

175
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,440
Hayate! Hayate!

176
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,750
Are you all right, Hayate?

177
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,360
Yes, Milady.

178
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:20,390
Get him.

179
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,210
Are you really all right?

180
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,230
Yes. Nothing's wrong with me.

181
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,600
Here I go!

182
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,630
Drill Knee!

183
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,670
A move I've seen once is-

184
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,140
Broken Heavy Knuckle!

185
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,410
H-Hayate...

186
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,220
Milady...

187
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,560
Hell and Heaven!

188
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,600
Hayate!

189
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,910
Hayate...

190
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:15,380
Shion!

191
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,480
Yes.

192
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:19,670
Yay.

193
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,730
Yay!

194
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,830
Ayasaki Hayate. If you don't want this picture-

195
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,030
Sweet crepe. Yummy crepe.

196
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:32,800
It's Crepe Oji-san's, Japan's number one moving house of crepes.

197
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,800
Kuzuha-sama!

198
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,440
Hayate!

199
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,130
Finish him off just in case.

200
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,480
Usage of Final Hammer approved!

201
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,610
Drive!

202
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,610
Hayate! Get a hold of yourself!

203
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,540
Milady. Please don't worry about me and get out of here.

204
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,150
Don't be foolish.

205
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,710
I can't possibly get out of here, leaving you behind.

206
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,320
Gordian Giant Hammer!

207
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,000
Keep your hands off of Hayate!

208
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,290
Milady.

209
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,760
Turn into light!

210
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,440
Who are you?

211
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,010
Are you with them?

212
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,530
Whatever, it doesn't matter.

213
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:28,650
I'll take the chance to show you my last weapon.

214
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,820
And that is-

215
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,640
Courage!

216
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,730
You're...

217
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,520
Hayate!

218
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,300
Hayate!

219
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,040
Himegami. You...

220
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,990
Himegami? Who would that be?

221
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,320
I'm an unknown hero.

222
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,150
Princess God.

223
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,890
Note: Hime = Princess; Gami = God

224
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,890
That is  your name.

225
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,930
Dai! Baku! Hatsu!

226
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,930
Dai! Baku! Hatsu! = Big Explosion!

227
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,930
Tsumaigoimura

228
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,930
Tsumaigoimura = Tsumagoi Village

229
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,700
What? Where am I?

230
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,270
Hey, Hayate-kun, it's been a while.

231
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,840
Hey.

232
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,590
Dad? Mom?

233
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:28,220
You two went missing a year ago after leaving all the debts you made to me.

234
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,750
Well, what happened to you? Your outfit?

235
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:35,340
Me? I'm a butler for Lady Sanzenin Nagi right now.

236
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,380
So, what business do you have?

237
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,490
It's very rude of you two to come back now.

238
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,020
Well, "butler"?

239
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,030
Hayate-kun, you can't possibly manage such a position.

240
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,720
After all, you are our son.

241
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,640
Wh-What?

242
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,990
A-Are you all right, Hayate?

243
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,680
You're finally awake.

244
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,640
S-So it was a dream.

245
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,520
Are you really all right?

246
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,460
Yes.

247
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:13,360
I'm sorry, after all I'm the one who protects you.

248
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,970
It's all right. Everyone has bad days.

249
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:22,630
Besides, climbing back up after a loss is a standard plot in any hero manga.

250
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,720
Y-Yes...

251
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,740
Where have you been all this time?

252
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,640
What do you think you're doing, coming back now?

253
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,480
Besides, Himegami! You were fired from the Sanzenin family long ago!

254
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,480
And what is that mask?

255
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,480
So he's Himegami-san.

256
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,620
Is it from that?

257
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,540
And what is the meaning behind the mask?

258
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,750
That strange white crucified thing?

259
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,290
Then hold a spear, too!

260
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,760
Hey, wake up!

261
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,190
My head hurts.

262
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,030
Why?

263
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,310
Because I just hit you.

264
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,600
Do you want another one?

265
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,900
Himegami! What do you think you're doing to Milady?!

266
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,700
An eye for an eye.

267
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,080
That's my beauty.

268
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,210
You...

269
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,850
Besides, I'm not Himegami.

270
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,280
I'm Princess God.

271
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,290
An unknown hero just passing by.

272
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,360
Quit it already, Himegami!

273
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,050
I am not Himegami.

274
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,360
I have said you cannot punch her many times, haven't I, Himegami-kun?

275
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,610
Like I've been saying, I'm Princess-

276
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,970
No, no, you are Himegami Akane.

277
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:33,270
Um, why was Himegami-san fired from this mansion?

278
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,680
Because he's a moron.

279
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,680
I fired him because he's an absolute moron.

280
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,610
Hmm! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

281
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:42,250
You think that mask is cool?

282
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:44,260
Despite what Milady says, he's definitely a butler.

283
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:46,820
I already have Hayate, so it's too late to come back now.

284
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,820
He has the air of a perfect example.

285
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,560
Nagi and Himegami-kun were always like that.

286
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,740
Oh, I see.

287
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,530
Well, let's have some tea for now.

288
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:04,060
Milady and Himegami-san,
both of you please drink this and relax.

289
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,570
Yeah, thank you.

290
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,620
It's hot!

291
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,640
Hayate, what's wrong with this tea?

292
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,730
It's so hot that it burns my tongue.

293
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,160
What? It can't be.

294
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:22,980
Hayate?

295
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,460
Hey, Ayasaki! What do you think you're doing?!

296
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,390
You fail as a butler if you're like that!

297
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:32,230
I'm sorry. Pardon my rudeness.

298
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,200
Hey, that's odd, something's wrong.

299
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,210
I'm sure I did it properly.

300
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:41,270
This wasn't the last of Hayate's mistakes.

301
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,620
Eh?

302
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,440
Ayasaki!

303
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,970
Eh?

304
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,480
Ayasaki!

305
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,510
Eh?

306
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,750
Ayasaki!

307
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,320
He got lost on the way back from shopping.

308
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,460
Eh?

309
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,490
Ayasaki...

310
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,760
Ayasaki! What do you think you're doing?!

311
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,600
I'm sorry!

312
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,930
Would you like a Christmas cake?

313
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,950
What is this? I get the feeling that something bad is happening to Hayate-kun.

314
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,650
To me, too?!

315
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:22,110
Let's set this aside and pan back to the mansion.

316
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,720
Hayate, what's gotten into you?

317
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,520
It's completely unlike you.

318
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,790
Yes...

319
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,760
How about you take a little time off?

320
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,560
No, I can't.

321
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:35,110
Yes, it might be a good idea.

322
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:39,700
I'm fine. I can't possibly take time off at the end of the year when it's busy.

323
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:44,500
Don't worry. We have Maria, so go ahead and have a good rest.

324
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,890
As you say.

325
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,670
I wonder what happened to Hayate-kun.

326
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,820
He's become incapable of doing any task a butler does.

327
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,660
Hey, Maria. Do you think I'm incapable as a master?

328
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,490
I want to cheer up Hayate, but the right words won't come out.

329
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:17,670
Even if he makes some mistakes or loses in a fight or two, Hayate is still Hayate.

330
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,710
But I always had this image of Hayate being an invincible hero somewhere in my mind.

331
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,670
Milady...

332
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,380
What is going on with me?

333
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:38,160
It's because your powers as a butler
have been sucked away by that woman.

334
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,590
Himegami-san.

335
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,920
Banana?

336
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,530
I'm not sharing with you.

337
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,950
I don't understand him.

338
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,860
Forget the banana. What was it that you mentioned?

339
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,330
Right now, you've lost your powers as a butler...

340
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:01,240
...because of a curse by the superintendent of the Hakuou Academy.

341
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,500
Why do you know that?

342
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,450
This is back from the School Festival.

343
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,490
You were watching over Milady all this time?

344
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,290
Answer me!

345
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,430
Nagi is sad.

346
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,800
Because you, who she trusted so much, lost.

347
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,610
And there is no chance of you being capable of protecting Nagi.

348
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,640
What-

349
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,180
See? Just as I said.

350
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,170
Take my advice.

351
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,720
Leave this place.

352
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,360
No stamp or anything.

353
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,350
Someone brought it here directly?

354
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,380
Hayate-kun?

355
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,470
Would you like to join us for a tea?

356
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,610
This is...

357
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,980
This was for the best.

358
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,950
This is the only thing I can do to protect Milady.

359
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,110
Hayate disappears into the dark alone.

360
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,960
What's the truth behind his words?

361
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,930
Next week, we'll fight against the final episode.

362
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,130
Wataru and,

363
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:31,830
Saki and,

364
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,390
Nagi's...

365
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,790
Butler Network!

366
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,400
I am back. I'm Sanzenin Nagi.

367
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,600
I'm Tachibana Wataru.

368
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,780
I'm Kijima Saki.

369
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:44,500
Hey Nagi. I thought this section was supposed to be
Rental Video Tachibana's advertisement until this week.

370
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,320
I got feedback saying watching you two flirt with each other is annoying, so I'm here to inspect.

371
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,590
"Flirt"? That's such a filthy word, Lady.

372
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,180
That's right. Don't be foolish.

373
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,600
In the end, do you like Isumi or Saki-san more?

374
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,680
Hey, it's time.

375
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,880
Next week will be a special.

376
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:04,860
If I become your butler, you will give up on the Sanzenin estate?

377
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,380
But why are you saying that after taking my powers as a butler away?

378
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,560
You will be gaining more butler powers than before.

379
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:14,970
And you will be reborn as a perfect butler that swears his body and soul to me.

380
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,670
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

381
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,000
Preview of the final episode, part two.

382
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,170
Friends of the Well-Behaved. Praise the Debt-Ridden Butler!

383
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:23,250
Hayate! As long as you're with me...

384
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,150
Milady!

385
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:24,980
Did you know?

386
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:29,210
In American shows, ending a show at a place that makes you eager to see the next episode is a "cliffhanger".
