1
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,350
When watching TV,

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,820
make sure the room is well lit,

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,060
and watch from a distance.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,020
Got it?

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,860
Last episode!

6
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:18,280
Due to the whimsical superintendent's whimsical whim,
the Butler Battle Tournament starts at Hakuou Academy.

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:24,740
Nonohara-san, your move takes
a little too much time to get going.

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,610
Great fights one after another.

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:32,100
And after a tremendous battle, the Sanzenin butler, Ayasaki Hayate wins the first round, as well!

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,480
It's an incredible battle aura.

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,250
What kind of ultimate move is he getting ready?

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,520
It's coming, Hayate!

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,520
That's right; I don't have the time to wimp out.

14
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,750
I have to look good in front of Milady.

15
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,050
Winner, Sanzenin butler, Ayasaki Hayate!

16
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,830
Um, I didn't do anything...

17
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:06,930
I see, you used your chi to rip his clothes up.

18
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,280
Good job, Hayate!

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,010
End of summary.

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,550
One who masters being a butler becomes the master of the world.

21
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:19,160
The Butler War that shakes the planet starts!

22
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,690
Oh, Klaus-san. What are you doing with that strange mask on?

23
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,230
You're the only person who noticed, Maria.

24
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,900
I hear a true master can win without laying a finger on the opponent.

25
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,270
Hayate, I never thought you had reached that level.

26
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,140
You flatter me.

27
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,180
The opponent self-destructed in that last match.

28
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,260
Here you go, Milady.

29
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,510
Thank you.

30
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,050
Hayate, doing this reminds us of some old memories, doesn't it?

31
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,120
Reminds us of what?

32
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,870
Hey, you haven't forgotten, have you?

33
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,630
That day.

34
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,030
So many months have passed since then.

35
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:46,310
Hayate, thank you for your hard work.

36
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,800
Here, you drink this.

37
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,740
Milady.

38
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:54,650
Since I do need you to win the tournament.

39
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,680
Yes.

40
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,390
That's Himuro-san.

41
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,950
Don't make a big fuss because he fits the handsome mold.

42
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,280
Hayate's a lot cooler.

43
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,340
Please...

44
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,640
Sir, this is far enough.

45
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,830
So Himuro-san's in this tournament, as well.

46
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,320
Okay, I will observe your ultimate attack.

47
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,250
Let's get this going.

48
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:41,430
The three men in black from Saginomiya versus Oukouchi's Saeki Himuro!

49
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,780
Three against one?

50
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,870
How dirty!

51
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,390
Don't be rude! Us men in black of Saginomiya are...

52
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,270
...united three as one!

53
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,900
Body and soul.

54
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,170
Shou*** Tai!

55
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,140
Very interesting.

56
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,550
Fight!

57
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,030
Then, here I go.

58
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,480
Bonjour?

59
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:26,980
U-Um, where's the Butler Battle Tournament's hall?

60
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:38,810
I am starting to feel I was yet again unable to see the moment of truth.

61
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,120
W-Winner, Saeki Himuro!

62
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,820
Sh-She's always lost...

63
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:54,030
...so we wanted the 100 credits...

64
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,470
...since she can't make it to school often enough.

65
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,130
Himuro!

66
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,380
Good work.

67
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,610
Hurry and win the battle for me!

68
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,230
I'm counting on you for the bonus, Sir Taiga.

69
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:15,030
W-We didn't get to see the ultimate move at all.

70
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:15,750
Yeah...

71
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,710
I can't afford to lose.

72
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,830
However, despite his high spirits...

73
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:25,830
Fight!

74
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,440
Kame**me...

75
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,710
I give up.

76
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,960
Winner, Ayasaki-kun!

77
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,610
Eh?!

78
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,100
Wh-Why?

79
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:51,090
Yes, the extra butlers all feared him so much from his victory in the first round that they all forfeited one after another.

80
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,860
The tournament kept progressing,

81
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:56,830
And the tournament's best four has been chosen.

82
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,300
Semi-final, first match!

83
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:05,340
The Hanabishi family! Part-time butler, Hinagiku Katsura!

84
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:13,140
The Asakaze family! Part-time butler, Kashiwagi!

85
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,880
My butler...

86
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,360
...ran away!

87
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,170
R-Risa-chin...

88
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,370
Why?

89
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,060
I bet she can't pay any more cash.

90
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,610
W-Winner, my sister!

91
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,000
First one to the final!

92
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,600
Hina, fight for me, too.

93
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,370
Risa.

94
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,340
Here's a little something from me.

95
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:51,910
What? This is a bill from the butler you hired!

96
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:57,050
I bought the Ikki***sen DVD wanting to see the main character that never comes out,

97
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,150
and I went over my credit limit.

98
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,890
You have to pay it yourself!

99
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:07,430
Is it really all right that I'm left in the best four?

100
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,840
It is God's will.

101
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,210
What? Can you even hear others speaking in their head?

102
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:19,950
The Sanzenin family butler! Hayate Ayasaki!

103
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,050
They're calling for you.

104
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,650
Yes!

105
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:37,880
The Oukouchi family butler! Himuro Saeki!

106
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,840
Himuro-san, why did you enter this tournament?

107
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,490
Why?

108
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,170
Because I...

109
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,570
...love money!

110
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,070
Hayate!

111
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,650
That guy...

112
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,130
He's pretty good.

113
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,040
Seems so.

114
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,580
As expected from Himuro-san.

115
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,630
I got dragged into his pace.

116
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,310
B-But...

117
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,650
...it finally feels like a battle!

118
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,430
Sir Taiga?

119
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,440
I see.

120
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,330
Attacked by a fearful beast?

121
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:56,540
I-I'm sorry. I went to buy stuff for you for your hard work but...

122
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,510
Yes, I'll be right there.

123
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,130
Hayate-kun, we'll save this for another time.

124
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,900
What?

125
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,300
Oh what the heck!

126
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,990
Winner, Ayasaki Hayate!

127
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,600
A-Again?

128
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,270
He got scared off by Hayate.

129
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,750
R-Right, since I won this match...

130
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,830
...I-I'm up against Hinagiku-san next.

131
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,110
This is going to be difficult.

132
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,780
Is he supposed to rejoice at the victory?

133
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,850
Moving on to the final.

134
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:41,870
Nurarihyon! = Goblin!

135
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,870
Nurarihyon!

136
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,890
Eee?

137
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,890
Eee? = Ehh?

138
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,890
Era kokyuu shite mo ii desuka?

139
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,890
Era kokyuu shite mo ii desuka? = May I breathe through my gills?

140
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,070
Hanabishi family, part time butler! Katsura Hinagiku!

141
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,100
Here!

142
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,840
Sanzenin family butler! Ayasaki Hayate!

143
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,640
H-Here!

144
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,940
Welcome to the final, both of you.

145
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,760
Those were very brave battles you fought.

146
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,290
I don't remember much of a fight.

147
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,930
Now, get ready for your last battle.

148
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:28,170
The winner of the match receives the right to fight Shion as the representative of the students.

149
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,170
Any objections?

150
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,400
No.

151
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,920
No, not really.

152
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,710
To honor you two, I will now announce the new school anthem.

153
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,350
It's a masterpiece I made myself, staying up all night.

154
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,820
A new school anthem?

155
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,260
This is a good chance, Hayate-kun.

156
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,690
You should learn how fearful that superintendent is.

157
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,560
I'm in this tournament to beat her.

158
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,490
Hinagiku-san.

159
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,230
Suginami no chi wo shihai suru

160
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,230
It rules the city of Suginami

161
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,670
Shiroki manabiya

162
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,670
The white academic building

163
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,690
Waga bokou

164
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,690
My school

165
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,310
Muneno enjin hi wo tsukete

166
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,310
Get the engine in your heart to work.

167
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,090
Hakuou!

168
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,090
Hakuou!

169
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,470
Hakuou!

170
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,460
Hakuou!

171
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:23,430
Rokumega shock. Shuushokuritsu 120%

172
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,430
6MB shock, 120% employment rate!

173
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,960
Hakuou Gakuin.

174
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,960
Hakuou Academy!

175
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,980
Ochitsuke! Ochitsuite benkyou surunda!

176
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,980
Calm down! You must calm down and study!

177
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:32,430
Looks like everyone's fascinated by its majesty.

178
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,430
Hakuou!

179
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,430
Hakuou!

180
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,670
Hakuou!

181
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,670
Hakuou!

182
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,040
Kuzuha-sama.

183
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,550
Cornelia wana.

184
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,550
Cornelia's trap.

185
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,160
See?

186
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,750
Yes, I agree we must defeat her.

187
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,470
Hakuou!

188
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,470
Hakuou!

189
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,020
Haukou!

190
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,020
Hakuou!

191
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,910
If we keep letting her act as she wants, then our school's doomed.

192
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,680
Rokumega mainichi koushin.

193
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,680
6MB marching down every day.

194
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,650
Hakuou Gakuin!

195
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,650
Hakuou Academy!

196
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,890
Superintendent!

197
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,620
I will definitely win against her!

198
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,720
But I will reject the prize, of course!

199
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,110
Is that fine with you, Miki-chan?

200
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,660
I-It's fine.

201
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,050
We are student council members.

202
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,830
We can't possibly actively skip classes.

203
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,580
You always are though.

204
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,280
A hundred credits?

205
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,570
I feel bad for the students who are diligently taking classes.

206
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,540
This school isn't your toy.

207
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,810
Students! I will defeat the superintendent!

208
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,020
And I will bring revolution to this school!

209
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,690
Please give me the power to make revolution in this school!

210
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,900
It's as you hear, Hayate-kun.

211
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,180
But a fight is a fight.

212
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,160
What should I do? She's serious.

213
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,710
I'm on the hot seat.

214
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,440
Absolutely trapped by fate.

215
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,410
Okay, ready?

216
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,390
Final round match!

217
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:58,640
Hinagiku Katsura versus Hayate Ayasaki!

218
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,610
Super Battle Time!

219
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,320
Here I come!

220
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,240
P-Please stop, Hinagiku-san!

221
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,110
There is no reason for us to fight!

222
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:19,170
You're not holding back because I'm a girl, are you?

223
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,650
Completely like an away game.

224
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,950
Hayate-kun, it's cowardly of you to keep running away.

225
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,580
Fight fair and square!

226
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,240
Hayate! Straighten yourself out!

227
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,790
Why are you so earnest?

228
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,550
Hurting others through physical means isn't all there is to being a butler.

229
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,000
Hayate, you of all people should know that.

230
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,890
Milady...

231
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,710
Yes.

232
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,390
Hayate-kun! Fight!

233
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,480
I'm sorry, Hinagiku-san.

234
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,370
I understand that you're serious about protecting the school from the Superintendent.

235
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,960
But I have something I must protect, too.

236
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,830
W-Winner, Ayasaki Hayate!

237
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,490
Um, Hinagiku-san.

238
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:39,870
Pervert.

239
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,150
But I guess a defeat is a defeat.

240
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,440
I was getting carried away, too.

241
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,700
I have more to learn.

242
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:53,570
Ayasaki Hayate-kun. As regretful as it is,
I entrust Hakuou Academy's future to you.

243
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,410
Is that all right with you all?

244
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,580
Um, please don't leave something that big in my hands.

245
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,950
He is our, as students, representative.

246
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,800
Now, accept our challenge!

247
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,230
Superintendent's butler, Kuresato Shion!

248
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,320
Wait!

249
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,970
Show them what you have.

250
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,890
Yes, Ma'am.

251
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,550
Let's get this started, shall we?

252
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,470
Don't worry, Hayate-kun. You can win.

253
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:38,140
Hinagiku-san, stop advancing the story on your own.

254
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,220
Hayate.

255
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,840
Well... you know...

256
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,420
I'm very happy with your fights so far, but...

257
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:53,260
I would love to see you knock out the opponent!

258
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,820
Looks like I can't back out now.

259
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,070
I will do this!

260
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,940
Yes, that's the spirit, Hayate!

261
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,270
For the school's future!

262
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:16,780
Fight!

263
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:21,090
I must be careful not to get caught up in that strange move.

264
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,260
It's useless, Ayasaki-kun.

265
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,860
Crap!

266
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,860
My Poetic World sends its melody directly to the brain.

267
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,070
You can't leave this zone anymore.

268
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,380
Wh-What's wrong, Ayasaki-kun?

269
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,540
That's...

270
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,580
Hayate-kun, go after her legs!

271
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,880
Get her off her footing!

272
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,550
The effect should wear off if she's distracted!

273
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,920
Hinagiku-san?

274
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,690
I won't let you!

275
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,980
O-Oh no! My secret...

276
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,710
Um, you're...

277
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,780
D-Don't say it!

278
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,600
Allow me to explain.

279
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,820
Superintendent's butler, Kuresato Shion is a female student in the junior high.

280
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:34,710
When her secret boots come off, she can't maintain her figure and reverts to child form.

281
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,290
She's become a completely different character!

282
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,720
I'm already an adult!

283
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,470
I'm not a little kid!

284
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,440
I-I'm a cool adult who matches Kuzuha-sama!

285
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,750
Shion, stop it now.

286
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,120
You lose.

287
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,150
Kuzuha-sama.

288
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,040
You're not so bad being small.

289
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,790
We'll step away for today and confirm our love.

290
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,720
Yes.

291
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,000
Um...

292
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:16,000
You seem like a toy I can play with a lot.

293
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:21,350
Y-You better remember this! I will come back for you!

294
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,220
SFX: Silence~

295
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,450
Um...

296
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,310
How do I deal with this?

297
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,400
Um...

298
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,490
That's how the Butler Battle Tournament ended.

299
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,430
There!

300
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,450
I said it ended.

301
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,660
Hey, it's a jellyfish.

302
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,470
I wonder if the jellyfish is edible.

303
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,960
So, what happened to the prize, the hundred credits?

304
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,690
She did give it to me.

305
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:18,010
That superintendent doesn't lie, after all.

306
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,200
Then...

307
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,470
No, we returned it.

308
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:27,810
He wasted my generosity,
since I often make him skip school with me.

309
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:32,750
Was she worried about Hayate-kun's attendance?

310
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,540
Thank you for your thoughts.

311
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:39,350
But I will make sure to manage school between work.

312
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,330
Go!

313
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,860
Even the battle tournament winner can't stand in a game.

314
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,670
I will win the next match!

315
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,830
Sure, bring it on.

316
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,980
Ready?

317
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,330
Shion, what do you think?

318
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,980
About that boy, Ayasaki.

319
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,420
"What"? Well...

320
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:13,820
That boy... He unexpectedly...

321
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,520
...turns me on.

322
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:16,830
Eh?

323
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,300
I've made up my mind.

324
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,560
I don't care about battle tournaments.

325
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,070
Come! League of Mysterious Dark Butlers!

326
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:35,140
We will bring Ayasaki Hayate to us no matter what it takes!

327
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,890
What is this League of Mysterious Dark Butlers?

328
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,830
And what will happen to Hayate?

329
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,860
Next time, we'll fight against the Gun**m freak's trivia.

330
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,190
Nagi and...

331
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:31,890
Hayate's...

332
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,530
Butler Network!

333
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,250
Good night through good morning.

334
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,530
I'm Sanzenin Nagi.

335
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,870
I'm Ayasaki Hayate.

336
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:42,490
It's starting to turn out like a shounen manga.

337
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,510
Will you be fighting against freaks every week from now on?

338
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,180
No, next week will be a normal story.

339
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,850
Looks like the anime staff is going through lots of brainstorming.

340
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,120
It's hard to go original.

341
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,750
You're right, Milady.

342
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,050
Don't miss the staff's futile resistance.

343
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,360
Basara!

344
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:06,420
Sir, my mother suggested I have a marriage meeting.

345
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,990
That's nice.

346
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:11,730
Oh, Mom? Get the arrangements moving at once.

347
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:12,740
Yes, by any means.

348
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,200
What? Saki!

349
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,140
Therefore, next Sunday, I will be having my meeting.

350
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,810
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

351
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:21,620
Marriage Meeting.

352
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,540
Did you know?

353
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,040
The hottest spice in the world is Red Savina Habanero.
