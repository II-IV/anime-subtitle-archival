1
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,210
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,060
Got it?

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,520
A butler is one who serves.

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,000
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,020
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,320
Yes.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:32,940
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,610
My name is Hayate.

9
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,110
The Earth is under attack.

10
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,180
And so is your life.

11
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,470
Hey, it's Isumi.

12
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,690
You were surprisingly fast.

13
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,460
I was worried that you might have been lost again.

14
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,920
I am sorry I made you worry.

15
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,920
But I did get lost, so no concerns there.

16
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,530
Ah, I see.

17
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:40,460
The person, who I presume
is your new butler, brought me here.

18
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,360
You met Hayate?

19
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,980
He was wearing a brand new cashmere jacket.

20
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,110
Yes, that does sound like Hayate-kun.

21
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:51,520
But if you do not hurry, he might die.

22
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,880
Did Hayate get caught up in another mess?

23
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,920
It's highly possible.

24
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,010
Oh no, Hayate is in a pinch. We need to go save him, Maria.

25
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,090
Maybe I shouldn't have made him wear something he wasn't used to wearing.

26
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,130
U-Umm...

27
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,900
Because he's sick...

28
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,910
Cashmere jacket, eh? Let's go, Maria!

29
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,760
Yes, indeed.

30
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,380
It's the biggest crisis he's faced yet since becoming a butler.

31
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,650
Man, I have to do something about this jacket,

32
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,490
or else I won't be able to go back to the mansion, ever.

33
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,540
Maybe I'll borrow some money and get a new jacket.

34
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,960
No, that won't solve anything.

35
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,670
Hey, Ayasaki!

36
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,360
It's been a while.

37
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,710
Y-You're...

38
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,570
The very kind people who tried to take me to the southern paradise.

39
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:48,670
Don't say such embarrassing stuff out loud in the middle of the city.

40
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,410
So you were still alive, eh?

41
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,380
Y-Yes.

42
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:58,170
But you know, business aside, I like people like you.

43
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,390
Well, this must be some fate, so how about I treat you to lunch-

44
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,780
There he is!

45
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,080
Hey Ayasaki, what are they?

46
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,230
Don't even have to ask. They're mafia.

47
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,630
I see. Same bunch as us.

48
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,450
I knew you were suspicious from the beginning; so you were associated with them.

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,850
No!

50
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,010
Hey four-eyes. You got something to do with our son here?

51
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,780
When did I become part of you?

52
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,260
I see. So you're eager to see some blood, are you?

53
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,700
I don't know what group you're from, but you've got some nerve.

54
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,690
Hey, I just noticed, but aren't I in big trouble here?

55
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:43,030
At this rate, I'll be scolded not by Maria-san but by the government.

56
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,500
Above all, I might cause trouble to Milady.

57
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,330
I must get out of this somehow.

58
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,590
Hey, where do you think you're going, Ayasaki?

59
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,480
You're not planning to abandon
your group to get away, are you?

60
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,410
So when did I become a part of your group?

61
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,560
What? Abandoning your group to get out of the mess unscathed alone?

62
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,270
You call yourself human?

63
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,940
What a cold-hearted guy.

64
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,420
I'm going to get criticized from that side, too?

65
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,760
Looks like we have...

66
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,360
...No choice but to do him in.

67
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,790
Ah, I see.

68
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,530
I'm going to die today.

69
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,530
Today is a great day.

70
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:29,400
If I knew this was going to happen, I should have apologized to Maria-san when I'd made it back to the mansion.

71
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,620
Yeah, if I can make it out of this alive, I'll apologize to her.

72
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,150
Get him!

73
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,030
Here I come!

74
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,460
What are you stalling for! Let's go!

75
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:02,820
We're talking about Hayate here. If we don't go fast,
he might get stabbed by many swords!

76
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,830
That can't possibly happen.

77
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,080
But the new jacket must be torn to pieces.

78
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,910
It can't be. Don't underestimate Hayate.

79
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,180
No, the jacket already is torn apart.

80
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,520
I see. That's indeed our Hayate.

81
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,440
The jacket got ruined because of me,
yet he looked quite troubled.

82
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,230
He must take his job as your butler that seriously.

83
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,800
After hearing that, we can't scold him
too much for ruining the jacket, can we?

84
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,220
I wasn't planning to from the start.

85
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,540
Speak of the devil. He must be back.

86
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,010
Oh well.

87
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,550
Thank goodness. I made it back alive.

88
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,030
You can't yell at Hayate, okay, Maria?

89
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,860
We need to welcome him back warmly.

90
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,430
If you say so.

91
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,240
Come to think of, did Hayate say anything about me?

92
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,700
Like, "cute" or "adorable" or...

93
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,680
Let's see... Um...

94
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:12,980
If I remember correctly,
"Little, stubborn, selfish, and sometimes goes wild..."

95
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,950
I've just returned.

96
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,300
Milady-

97
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,720
Wh-Why?!

98
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,540
Why are you shutting me out, Milady?

99
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,520
Shut up! Idiot! Idiot!

100
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,810
Seriously. What's wrong with him.

101
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,490
"...But kind and cute."

102
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,100
I think it's better to say that earlier.

103
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:42,180
And so the debt-filled butler's life ends.

104
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,810
P-Please, don't joke like that.

105
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,190
It's hot.

106
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:00,760
I'm sorry for causing trouble.

107
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,040
38.9°C.

108
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,900
He definitely has a fever.

109
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,320
Even though the cold front came in all of a sudden, to catch a cold...

110
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,190
You can't possibly be that weak.

111
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,240
I am not sure if he is weak or not,

112
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,630
but after getting shut out under the cold sky with the drenched clothes for hours,

113
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,010
I'm sure anyone would catch a cold.

114
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,250
~stare~

115
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,490
*stare*

116
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:36,560
Wh-What? You talk as if I'm the bad person!

117
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:39,500
Are you in pain, Hayate-kun?

118
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,470
Very.

119
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,800
*stare*

120
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,210
~stare~

121
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,300
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

122
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,950
Don't stare at me like Kenshi*** that awakened from the Dream Reincarnation style.

123
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:02,800
You can't do anything about catching a fever. Get a good rest.

124
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,320
Ah... Yes.

125
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,020
It's a milk shake.

126
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,790
It'll warm you up.

127
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,800
Thank you very much.

128
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,990
Oh no. Although Nagi shutting you out was the final blow,

129
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,000
I was the original cause.

130
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,600
In Isumi's mind, she's supporting Nagi.

131
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,140
Yes, Milady did give me the deathblow, but...

132
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,980
So you go to the same school as Milady.

133
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,780
I'm sorry about the great misunderstanding I had.

134
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,150
Please don't worry.

135
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,020
Thank you for this.

136
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,620
Yes, I hope you like it.

137
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,750
Wow, this is really good.

138
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,120
I'm glad you like it.

139
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,950
You made this, right?

140
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,190
You must be a good cook.

141
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,760
I'm not sure if I am good or not,

142
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,480
but I am a girl, after all, so...

143
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,200
It's wrong to think that you have
to cook because you're a girl, Isumi!

144
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,600
With such an old concept,
you can't live in this world of information.

145
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:15,680
Whenever you use complicated words, you're trying to mislead someone.

146
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,200
You know her well.

147
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,280
Anyways, 21st century has all sexes treated equally and no borders for all.

148
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,800
With that said, you haven't had lunch yet, have you, Hayate?

149
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,570
Ah, no.

150
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:33,620
Then I shall put all my effort to specially cook you porridge.

151
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,540
Eh?

152
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,610
You have a problem?

153
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:40,020
Are you saying you don't want to eat my cooking?

154
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,120
No, I meant my heart is filled with gratitude.

155
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,550
Good. Then prepare yourself as you wait.

156
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:51,310
I've read all of Mr.**** and Go****,
so there is no dish that I can't cook!

157
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,150
Come, Tama!

158
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,190
What's with that worrisome noise you're making?

159
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,900
Then I'll go get you a digestive medicine.

160
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,540
Good luck, Hayate-sama.

161
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,610
Y-Yes.

162
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,950
And this is how Lady Nagi's nursing started.

163
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:17,070
Since Milady is so full of confidence,
nothing that bad will come out, will it?

164
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,930
Hayate didn't feel like he would get better anytime soon.

165
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,140
Hey Saku, you were still here?

166
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,580
I was absorbed watching Down Town's DVD box, so I became hungry.

167
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,930
Then I'm about to start cooking, so I'll let you have a taste of it.

168
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,010
Oh yeah, I had other DVDs I had to watch.

169
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,200
Where are you going?

170
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,280
But since I'm going through the trouble of cooking, I'd like to make it a unique taste; one you can't find anywhere else.

171
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,020
This is the first mistake that people who suck at cooking fall into.

172
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,280
Something with a distinct taste...

173
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,630
Vinegar's good for the health, right?

174
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:01,370
Crap. No matter how many lives I may carry, Nagi's cooking would take them all away.

175
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,500
Hayate might just die.

176
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,540
What do you think, Sakuya?

177
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,070
What?

178
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,770
I'm sorry, Isumi-san.

179
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:14,480
What?

180
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,120
I mean, for Hayate-kun causing trouble in many ways.

181
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,190
Oh please, trouble?

182
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:25,760
But he indeed is the person Nagi chose.

183
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,600
He was so kind to me.

184
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:37,390
Did Hayate-kun give her a virus more complicating than fever?

185
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,500
Irasshaimase Goshujin-sama!

186
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,500
Irasshaimase Goshujin-sama! = Welcome, Master!

187
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,880
Mah, mah, mah. = Now, now, now.

188
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,880
Mah, mah, mah.

189
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,880
It's ready, Hayate.

190
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,180
I'm confident about the result, so enjoy it.

191
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,500
Hey, it actually looks good.

192
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,020
This might just be...

193
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,560
Ah, thank you.

194
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:09,630
Th-This isn't anything like the level of too salty or too much vinegar or not cooked completely.

195
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,540
I detect a faint odor of dish detergent.

196
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,310
What's wrong, Hayate?

197
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,380
You can't call this food...

198
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,890
Um, could it be that it's not good?

199
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,340
At times, men have to tough things out.

200
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,640
It's delicious.

201
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,890
Audience in front of the TV, you must not copy him.

202
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:35,460
Because dish detergent is neither food nor drink.

203
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,060
R-Really? That's great!

204
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,390
I didn't taste it myself, so I was worried,

205
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,530
but it's good, eh?

206
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,210
Yes, it's perfect, Milady.

207
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:47,870
The tiny bit of oil that I added must have done the job.

208
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,550
Oh, I see.

209
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,560
There's plenty more, so dig in.

210
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,620
It's great!

211
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,470
Oh my ********!

212
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,470
You're such a glutton.

213
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,710
To meet the master's expectations.

214
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,680
That's a butler's job.

215
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,700
Did she add this thinking it was oil?

216
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,750
To meet the master's expectations.

217
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,100
That's a pet's job.

218
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,500
Th-Thank you for the food.

219
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,820
Wow, you ate it clean.

220
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,670
You must have been really hungry.

221
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,270
I'll go clean this out, so you go back to resting.

222
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,490
Y-Yes, Sir.

223
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:32,280
I've gone through a lot of misery in my life,
but today, it's worse than ever.

224
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,950
If you push yourself too much, you'll really die.

225
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,420
Maria-san.

226
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:44,200
Really, I'm amazed that you ate all of that.

227
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,760
She added dish soap instead of oil, didn't she?

228
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,500
Well, yes.

229
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:56,200
But it was a dish that Milady made for me,

230
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,380
and I was happy to be nursed.

231
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:04,820
Your mother wouldn't nurse you when you got sick?

232
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:14,100
Whether I was sick or injured,
my mother would ignore me and invest in her dreams.

233
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,930
Envelope: Lunch Money

234
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,400
Wow...

235
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,400
How can he tell such a story so casually?

236
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:26,140
In any case, have a good night's sleep.

237
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,350
Yes, my eyelids are closing.

238
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,410
Then goodnight.

239
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,550
Hayate.

240
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,370
Thank you.

241
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,320
Um, what are you doing, Milady?

242
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:07,820
Um, if you're so up close to me, it's hard to fall asleep.

243
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,000
Shut up! Idiot Hayate! Idiot!

244
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,500
What? Milady?

245
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,250
Shut up, idiot!

246
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:21,920
You often hear kind people die sooner, but I think I see it now.

247
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:27,960
That concluded the poverty stricken butler's worst day ever.

248
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,160
However...

249
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,710
After a good night's sleep, I'm all better.

250
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:39,600
I couldn't do anything yesterday, so I've got a lot to do today.

251
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,550
Good morning.

252
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,430
Eh?

253
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,350
Ah... Yes, good morning.

254
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,490
It's a nice day outside, so it's a perfect day to do laundry.

255
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:53,910
Eh? Ah, yes, it is.

256
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:59,460
Look at this. You're the Sanzenin butler, and you have a crooked tie?

257
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:04,460
You must be mindful of your attire
so you don't embarrass your master.

258
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,300
Well then...

259
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,140
Good da-

260
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,870
U-Um!

261
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,490
Who was she?

262
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,760
Suspicious person inside the mansion?

263
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,790
Yes, she was wearing a maid outfit different from yours and had glasses on.

264
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,230
Any other traits?

265
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,790
Let's see...

266
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:40,470
She looks really capable at glance,
but she's definitely an all-natural character.

267
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,450
Ah, I see.

268
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:46,940
You don't need to worry about her, so please get started with your morning cleaning duties.

269
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:55,350
Oh, and I think there's another guest around,
so if you see him, please take him to the guest room.

270
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,060
Y-Yes, I will.

271
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,330
Tachibana is here?

272
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:06,830
Yes. Saki-san seems to be here,
so security must have let them through.

273
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,300
Klaus, it's me.

274
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,060
We have unwanted guests in the mansion.

275
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,730
Send them out.

276
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,470
Yes, by all means!

277
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,810
If it means no fatalities, then I allow you to use guns, as well.

278
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:18,600
Um...

279
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,510
Anyways, eliminate them right away! That's all.

280
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,120
You don't have to kick them out...

281
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,980
But I don't want Hayate to know.

282
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,040
She said there's another guest, but...

283
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,460
I wish the Earth would come to an end.

284
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,570
Wh-Who is this boy that's mumbling something really dangerous?

285
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:44,570
U-Um...

286
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,960
Uh? Who are you?

287
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,980
Don't talk to me with that poor-man's face, idiot!

288
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,700
Um... Um...

289
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:58,920
Oh, I get it. This snobbish brat must be
the guest Maria-san was talking about.

290
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,660
This sucks.

291
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,920
I'm so bored, so could you dive into this lake?

292
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,030
Sure.

293
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,160
Ehhh?!

294
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,400
Gotcha.

295
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,620
If you're a butler, be able to dodge that.

296
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,540
If you're that weak, you can't protect your master.

297
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,080
H-Hold on a moment please.

298
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,680
What, you have a problem with me?

299
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,250
No, I was told to see the guest to
the guest room when I found him.

300
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,300
Wow, you've not going to get mad after I did this to you?

301
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,590
I'm used to it.

302
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,670
Sir, this is where you were?

303
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,560
Why do you care where I am?

304
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,330
Sir?

305
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,300
By the way, Sir, a question.

306
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,170
If you want to ask about this guy, I don't know anything.

307
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:52,750
No, I wanted to ask what that machine behind you is.

308
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:56,470
Robot: Security 8801

309
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,570
What? It's floating in the air.

310
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,080
M**** Drive?

311
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,130
Target confirmed.

312
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,600
Eliminating at once.

313
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,320
Elimination.

314
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,190
Elimination! Elimination!

315
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,980
What is that thing?

316
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,350
I asked you because I don't know!

317
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,230
I don't know about the Sanzenin's stupid robots!

318
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:18,160
Target confirmed!

319
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,030
Crap, from the front, too.

320
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:26,340
I don't know what's going on, but as the Sanzenin's butler, I must see the guests to the guest room safely.

321
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,070
Hold on tight!

322
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,140
You-

323
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:33,450
Please don't worry. As the Sanzenin's butler,
I will assure your safety.

324
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:37,020
I mean, don't hold us with your soaking clothes!

325
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,530
Y-Yes.

326
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,570
T-To touch a girl's body so nonchalantly...

327
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,190
You're so lecherous!

328
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,880
Oh, I'm sorry.

329
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,960
Please, don't move around so much in mid-air.

330
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:01,000
I did ask you to bring them to the guest room, but...

331
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,100
You didn't have to bring them though the roof.

332
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,730
I-I'm sorry.

333
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,910
I said it's cold.

334
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,840
Please let go of me already.

335
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,280
What are you going to do if I can't get married?

336
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,750
So, who are these two?

337
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,660
He's Tachibana Wataru-kun.

338
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,020
He's Nagi's...

339
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,300
...fiancé.

340
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,580
Heh?

341
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,990
The boy who visited Nagi.

342
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,440
Wataru, and his maid, Saki.

343
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,260
And Isumi.

344
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,840
Is Wataru really Nagi's fiancé?

345
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,000
The plot is starting to move.

346
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,200
Next time, we'll be fighting against the Tokyo Underground!

347
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,140
Oh, hold on, forgot one person.

348
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,430
You got to be kidding me.

349
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,190
Why the heck!

350
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,260
To be continued.

351
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:30,620
Nagi and...

352
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,360
Hayate's...

353
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,990
Butler Network!

354
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,460
Hello, I'm Ayasaki Hayate.

355
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,390
I'm Sanzenin Nagi.

356
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,960
This corner that started today. What exactly happens here?

357
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,570
This corner is meant to follow Hayate's endeavors in fighting against evil as he becomes a great butler.

358
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,540
Great evil?

359
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,010
By the way, what's the song in the background?

360
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:52,090
Yes, this is my image song made by a famous composer.

361
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,980
It's filled with my resolution to protect you.

362
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,220
Is it? Well I'm counting on you, Hayate.

363
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,180
Yes, Milady.

364
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,320
Bye bye.

365
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,550
You're Nagi's new butler, right?

366
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,920
Yes, my name is Ayasaki Hayate.

367
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,890
How about a little duel before we have breakfast?

368
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:13,430
Um, is dueling a standard pre-breakfast activity for celebrities?

369
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,710
I'm not sure, but he probably just wants to show off.

370
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,240
Just deck him good.

371
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,740
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

372
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,350
Man's Fight.

373
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,440
You ready, stupid butler?

374
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,620
Take this!

375
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,970
Lots of fan service next time, too!
