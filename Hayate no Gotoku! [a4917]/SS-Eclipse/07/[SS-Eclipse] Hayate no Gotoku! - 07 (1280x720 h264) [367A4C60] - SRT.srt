1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:09,480
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,090
Got it?

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,960
Let's go easy with the fan service shots and start with last episode's summary.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,170
A mysterious boy and his maid appeared in the mansion to visit Nagi.

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,480
Who could they be?

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,480
His name is Tachibana Wataru-kun.

7
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,010
He's Nagi's...

8
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,460
...fiancé.

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,490
End of summary.

10
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,820
No way, old man. You've got to quit being so shy.

11
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,820
Otherwise, you won't have any screen time.

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,290
Y-Yes...

13
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,030
Listen. You're lacking any impact in your character.

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,810
You need to exert spirit towards comedy,
even if it means pushing others aside.

15
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,200
Take a look.

16
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,710
Where's my glasses? Where's my glasses?

17
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,080
Where's my glasses? Where's my glasses?

18
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,540
A butler is one who serves.

19
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,040
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

20
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:15,040
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

21
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,090
Yes.

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:24,980
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

23
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,560
I hope my screen time will increase now.

24
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,730
That was it for you today.

25
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,870
Fiancé?

26
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,730
As in the person your parents have decided you're going to marry?

27
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,600
Yes, that fiancé.

28
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,660
I see.

29
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,190
So you do have a boyfriend.

30
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,670
No! Don't get me wrong!

31
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,670
He's a fiancé, not a boyfriend!

32
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,350
In other words, it's something that our families decided, so...

33
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,760
Still, I'm surprised that you were engaged.

34
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,190
Girls of the upper class are different.

35
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,540
To Nagi, his smile appears...

36
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,430
I never heard you were engaged!

37
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,370
Was the relationship with me a game to you?

38
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,670
...as such.

39
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,070
Hayate is furious.

40
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,640
I must resolve this misunderstanding.

41
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,390
But is it all right?

42
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,850
If Milady marries,
wouldn't the Sanzenin's name come to an end?

43
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,650
There is no need to worry about that,
since Nagi isn't the one marrying in.

44
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:04,620
Ah, then Wataru-kun is going to get taken in by Milady as an in-law.

45
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,360
I'm never going to give myself to Nagi!

46
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:13,100
But you can't find a chance like this;
someone as cute as Lady Nagi becoming your bride.

47
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,100
Hayate...

48
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:22,230
A selfish, whimsical manga nerd who thinks she's the most important person in the world will never get married.

49
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,740
What? I never want to hear that from a brat like you!

50
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,880
Idiot, idiot, idiot!

51
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,950
Right back at you, you ugly face, ugly face, ugly face!

52
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,170
So the fiancés do get along.

53
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,390
If this looks like they're getting along,
you should go to an ophthalmologist or a neurologist.

54
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,860
Can't you act like a girl a little?

55
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,080
Wataru-kun?

56
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,970
Th-That voice... could it be...

57
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,320
Good morning, Wataru-kun.

58
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,370
What are you doing so early in the morning?

59
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,840
Ya... Ah... Isumi...

60
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,820
Did you come here after hearing
the rumors about Nagi's new butler?

61
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,680
Something like that for me, too.

62
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,390
Boku?

63
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,830
But I just heard a loud noise.

64
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,620
You weren't fighting with Nagi, were you?

65
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,970
O-Of course not. We'd never fight.

66
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,500
Nagi and I are always very good friends.

67
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,080
What's with that big change in attitude?

68
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,500
Basically...

69
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,340
Wataru-kun likes Isumi-san.

70
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,710
He's engaged and yet likes someone else?

71
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,510
It's not a marriage either one wished for.

72
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,220
Then does Milady want to cancel the marriage with Wataru-kun?

73
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,180
Absolutely!

74
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,190
We don't love each other, so why get married?

75
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,160
If Isumi takes a liking to Wataru, everything will be solved, but...

76
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,980
Isumi doesn't see Wataru that way at all.

77
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,960
But in any case, if Wataru-kun and Isumi-san start dating, everything is solved, correct?

78
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,630
Yes. So you finally understood me.

79
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:01,040
Since we all haven't had breakfast yet,
why don't we all eat together?

80
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,800
Would you prefer a Japanese-style breakfast?

81
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,510
L-Let's see...

82
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,980
Then whichever you like.

83
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,420
I-Isumi, don't tell me you...

84
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,090
Then everyone, please head to the dining hall.

85
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,550
Hold it.

86
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:30,400
SFX: RUMBLE RUMBLE RUMBLE

87
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,480
You're Nagi's new butler, right?

88
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,360
Yes, my name is Ayasaki Hayate.

89
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,400
How about a little duel before we have breakfast?

90
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,210
Um, is dueling a standard pre-breakfast activity for celebrities?

91
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,040
I'm not sure, but he probably just wants to show off to Isumi.

92
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,370
It's such a waste of effort.

93
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:54,690
Losing might give him more attention, so just deck him good.

94
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,890
Y-Yes.

95
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,250
Ready, stupid butler?

96
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,970
Just to let you know, Hayate is strong.

97
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,610
After all, he can catch up to a car on a bicycle.

98
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,710
Don't be ridiculous!

99
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,140
A poor man like him can't possibly be strong.

100
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,600
Ever used a sword before?

101
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,170
Let's see.

102
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,520
That's about all I can do.

103
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,680
So what are you going to do?

104
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,560
Sh-Shut up!

105
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,060
Wh-When a man says he's doing something...

106
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,030
...he can't back out of it!

107
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,040
What should I do? Even if it's Milady's request...

108
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,240
Wait a minute, if I manage to get
the two of them to work things out...

109
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,530
Ka** no Kizu!

110
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,580
Isumi, will you...

111
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,670
Yes, I will marry you.

112
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,020
All right! My marriage is cancelled!

113
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,970
Well done, Hayate.

114
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,630
All right, now that's decided!

115
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,490
Here I come!

116
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:07,820
Watch me good, Milady. Ayasaki Hayate's great acting skill!

117
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,540
Take this!

118
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,000
But,

119
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,170
blades are dangerous, so I have to get that out of the way...

120
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,070
You got me.

121
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:21,610
Collapse.

122
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,730
What? That's strange.

123
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,160
The path to the happy ending should have opened with this.

124
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,950
My, Hayate-sama.

125
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:41,510
To lose on purpose in order not to hurt weak, yet violent, Wataru-kun's pride.

126
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,130
How kind of you.

127
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,180
What?

128
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,980
Really, Wataru-kun is so strong I didn't have any chance of beating him.

129
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,280
Wait.

130
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,210
I'll... never... forgive... you.

131
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,750
I will get you one day!

132
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,540
You'd better remember this!

133
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,100
You idiot!

134
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,990
I-It wasn't supposed to end like this.

135
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,550
To deck him mentally...

136
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,060
Hayate-kun is good.

137
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,040
That horrible acting... is he still mad that I didn't tell him that I have a fiancé?

138
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,740
Wataru leaves the mansion alone.

139
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,510
By the way, Saki-san's bath time was...

140
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,830
It was a nice bath.

141
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,940
...long enough to conclude part A.

142
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,010
Aishiteiru to itte kure = Tell me you love me

143
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,010
Aishiteiru to itte kure

144
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,990
Renai Beam! = Love Beam!

145
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,990
Renai Beam!

146
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,400
I think I should go apologize.

147
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,330
I've done a horrible thing to Wataru-kun.

148
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,570
Yes, I do feel bad to leave him alone.

149
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,490
Forget about him.

150
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:01,230
Besides, for a man to cry in front of others... There's a limit to how weak one can be.

151
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,510
What? "Weak"?

152
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,770
As much as it's true, an apology should come after making one cry.

153
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,490
You're the one that made him cry.

154
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,730
S-So let's say we're going to apologize to him, and so where is his mansion?

155
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,600
I'd call that a building rather than a mansion.

156
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,820
Yes. Wataru-kun lives at the top of the
Tachibana Group Shinjuku HQ building.

157
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,140
Oh, in the middle of the city.

158
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,540
Then the road is packed during this time.

159
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,970
Do you think the train is faster than a car?

160
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,660
Did I say something strange?

161
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,610
Have you ever ridden a train, Isumi?

162
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:49,270
I've been on the Orient Express and
the Siberia Super Express, but never on one in Japan.

163
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,130
Yeah.

164
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,700
Besides trains don't run that often, do they?

165
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,430
Then what about that?

166
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,180
It's only a game.

167
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,940
Milady, you've never gotten on a train before?

168
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,450
No, but were there that many stops for bullet trains within Tokyo?

169
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,910
Bullet trains?

170
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,720
You weren't talking about bullet trains when you said trains?

171
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:18,190
I'm sorry to ask this question,
but do any of you know what a subway is?

172
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,150
Subway?

173
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,730
Yes, like the Ooedo Line or the Marunouchi Line.

174
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,810
They're trains that run underground.

00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,470
Do bullet trains run under Tokyo, as well?

177
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,600
No, there are trains other than bullet trains.

178
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,080
What do you see out the window when you're underground?

179
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,570
Nothing really.

180
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,130
Doesn't it only carry **** and prohibit commoners to ride in it?

181
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,910
That's back in the Taishou Era.

182
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,480
This sounds interesting.

183
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,390
I had no intention of going to Wataru's house, but I'd like to ride this so-called subway.

184
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,900
Okay, let's go ride one of these subways!

185
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:57,270
But will it be all right for only children to ride such an unknown vehicle?

186
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:03,430
Even if you look only at Shinjuku Station,
approximately 570,000 people ride that unknown vehicle.

187
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,730
By the way, if you break it down,

188
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,630
the Toei Shinjuku Line takes 230,000 people,

189
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,340
the Ooedo Line takes 100,000 people,

190
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,470
and the Marunouchi Line takes 240,000 people.

191
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,980
That concludes my explanation.

192
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,690
You're very knowledgeable, Hayate.

193
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,470
It's as you see, so don't worry.

194
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,950
And I might be able to see some underground inhabitants or dinosaurs.

195
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,230
Th-That's exactly why I'm saying it's dangerous.

196
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,970
W-Well, Isumi-san's here, too, so I'll make sure neither gets lost.

197
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,230
And speaking of Isumi,

198
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,280
Where did she go?

199
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,030
Did she get lost already?

200
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,690
And we only took our eyes off of her for a moment.

201
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,050
We underestimated Isumi's ability.

202
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,750
Maria, contact security.

203
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,120
Hayate and I will search the neighborhood.

204
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,030
Yes!

205
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,180
Wait, Nagi!

206
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:55,150
I think Isumi must have headed to the subway, but...

207
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,820
What? Do you know how many subway stations there are within Tokyo?

208
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,300
The "subway" I'm talking about now is the image of subways Isumi has.

209
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,530
So she most likely hasn't made it to the real subway.

210
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,130
A triple decker on a cone please.

211
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,180
R-Really?

212
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:14,740
Yeah. It's impossible for Isumi to make it to her destination on her own.

213
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,770
So follow me, and you'll find her.

214
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:22,250
Isumi is at the closest subway-like place.

215
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,890
No wait, where is this place?

216
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:32,490
I-I don't know. But I found a construction worker who sounded like he'd seen Isumi, so...

217
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,060
Um, is this the entrance to the subway?

218
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:40,850
I had heard you're carrying a subway dinosaur in a bullet train.

219
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,030
Yeah, it is underground for sure.

220
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:50,270
But under Tokyo is a space that even the government doesn't have a full understanding of, so there just might be...

221
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,540
What? Missy?

222
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:58,280
And it was a good move of her to buy that construction site and go down underground with her bodyguards, but...

223
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,420
That's Gri****!

224
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,270
Guess I was seeing things.

225
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,110
Lucky or unlucky?

226
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,600
Milady! Where are you?

227
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,340
We need to head back once.

228
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,070
Or else we'll get lost, too.

229
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,640
Milady?

230
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,930
Y-You idiot. Don't move all of a sudden.

231
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,940
I thought you were going to leave me behind.

232
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,120
I'm not good with dark places like this,

233
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,680
so please don't move so suddenly.

234
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:39,190
But Milady, what do you do at night?

235
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,640
You can't go to bed alone?

236
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,700
Well, no, um... ah...

237
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,950
I can go to sleep alone.

238
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,120
I-I'm not a child, so...

239
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,930
I only have a little trouble sleeping.

240
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:55,380
And if a black out happens, it's dangerous.

241
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,910
It's fine.

242
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,380
That makes you cute.

243
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,650
But it looks like it was a mistake.

244
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:11,890
You shouldn't make loud noises underground.

245
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,560
When you do, they get surprised and come out.

246
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,290
I-Isumi-san!

247
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,160
Glad I found you. Let's run from here together.

248
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,810
Hurry, or else they'll catch up.

249
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,150
Oh my.

250
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,860
You're being a little too noisy.

251
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,790
SFX: STOP

252
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,230
Ofuda: EVIL SPIRITS BEGONE

253
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,630
How smart of them.

254
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,370
What?

255
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,170
Wh-What was that about?

256
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,110
That's how our dream about the subway ended.

257
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,890
You're such a fool!

258
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:05,760
Dinosaurs?

259
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,690
Underground inhabitants?

260
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,380
Of course they don't exist.

261
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,220
Listen, the subways are actually connected to Brazil.

262
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:15,950
Brazil?

263
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,320
Yeah. That country's on the other side of the world from Japan, right?

264
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,540
So it's connected to there.

265
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,650
But what you have to watch out for is that Brazil is another country.

266
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,700
So you have to show your passport.

267
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:34,520
Next time you get on the subway, show your passport and ask for one ticket to Rio de Janeiro for a child.

268
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,170
Got it?

269
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,140
Yes, I do, Sakuya. Thank you.

270
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:44,120
Hayate, if you still insist on going to apologize to Wataru, give this to him.

271
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,410
What is this?

272
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,680
You mustn't open it on the way,

273
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,060
since you never know who's watching from where.

274
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,750
It's the city.

275
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,330
But what is this?

276
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:05,750
It can't be a bomb to do away with the fiancé, can it?

277
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,370
Hey, it's the Sanzenin's butler.

278
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,100
Saki-san.

279
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,380
To see you here...

280
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,080
Do you have a business with Sir?

281
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,050
Yes, a little.

282
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,050
And I brought a package from Milady.

283
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,790
Then I will escort you up.

284
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,870
Really?

285
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:25,890
Thank you very much.

286
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,710
The HQ is this way, so please follow me without getting lost.

287
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,770
Ah... Yes.

288
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,220
I don't really get it, but is Saki-san avoiding me?

289
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,510
Um, Saki-san?

290
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,820
I'm sorry!

291
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,560
I'm not trying to avoid you or anything.

292
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,650
How do I say...

293
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:56,950
You see, it was my first time getting carried by
a male like that, so I'm avoiding you instinctively.

294
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,060
No, I don't mean you. Males in general!

295
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,960
I'm not bothered by it.

296
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,720
I'm used to being hated.

297
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,080
Um...

298
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,780
I'm sorry.

299
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,360
Here we are.

300
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,300
This is it.

301
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:18,040
Store Sign: Rental Video Tachibana

302
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,910
Um, isn't this a video rental shop?

303
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,790
That's right.

304
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,860
I've returned, Sir.

305
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,240
Ah, Saki. Good work.

306
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,160
What the heck are you doing here?

307
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,260
I-I brought this in place of Milady!

308
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,790
What? Videos I lent Nagi?

309
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,970
Videos?

310
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:49,470
Yeah. This is Tachibana Group's entertainment section, Rental Video Tachibana. Shinjuku HQ.

311
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:54,110
Tachibana Group, itself, is on the verge of bankruptcy due to the recession.

312
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,550
This rental chain store is its last stronghold.

313
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,650
Saki. Don't spill too much information.

314
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,990
Then the fiancé deal is...

315
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,760
My parents want Nagi's estate.

316
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,500
They are scared to lose money since the feeling of wealth is soaked all the way to their bones.

317
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,460
But what good can come with such a pessimistic mindset?

318
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,100
Just you watch.

319
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,770
I will make this store huge and make an estate incomparably huger than Sanzenin's.

320
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,170
I'll never become an in-law.

321
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,180
Then, I'm sure Isumi will...

322
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,620
He's badmouthed, but he's a very good boy.

323
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,930
That's why I can't leave him alone.

324
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,660
Saki! Stop standing around and get back to work!

325
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,700
Y-Yes!

326
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,090
Rental video... So the bag I brought in, too?

327
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,830
Yeah, it's our merchandise.

328
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,930
But someone with as much money as Milady could buy rather than rent.

329
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,600
You're naive.

330
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,310
There are super rare pieces of software that don't make it out into the market.

331
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,380
Th-Then the DVD over there, as well?

332
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,610
Yeah, this one is Tengen T-

333
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:06,000
Bamboo... Bamboo...

334
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,600
Just like that, we have treasures that can't be said out loud lined up in our store.

335
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,230
Genres we cover are anime and special effect movies.

336
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,470
B-But isn't it against the law to rent those out?

337
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:19,930
Doesn't matter, since I'm only boasting to Nagi personally.

338
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,400
But one day, I will surpass her in money.

339
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,870
Um, I'm really sorry for what I did to you the other day.

340
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,710
To make up for it, please let me be a member of this place.

341
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,680
Well, I guess you are a customer, too.

342
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,480
Ayasaki, was it?

343
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,740
I won't charge you the registration fee.

344
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,600
Hey!

345
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,770
You're already registered.

346
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,710
No way!

347
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:53,140
I've never registered with any rental shop.

348
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,290
But this is you.

349
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:56,500
Ayasaki Shun.

350
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,740
What? A different name?

351
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,970
It's my dad!

352
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,270
You have 158 videos that haven't been returned.

353
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,750
¥200 per late night...

354
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,880
...and you owe us ¥1,580,000.

355
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,920
I'm home.

356
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,600
Good work.

357
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,660
What's with the blue face?

358
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:27,030
We settled by agreeing to replace the tapes.

359
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,970
Monthly payment.

360
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:28,400
Huh?

361
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,870
Right when Hayate's debt increased,
here's another person having a rough time.

362
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,110
One child to Rio de Janeiro please.

363
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,050
To Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.

364
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,830
Um...

365
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:49,890
It's hard for people who can't tell lies
to be lied to and live in the current world.

366
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:54,460
But let's just say it's best for humans
to be honest, and we'll see you next week.

367
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,250
Nagi and...

368
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:31,940
Hayate's...

369
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,460
Butler Network!

370
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,390
Hayate, you're starting to understand the butler's job well.

371
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,190
Thank you very much, Milady.

372
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,320
But then, you still have much to learn. You don't have time to sing.

373
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,000
Huh...

374
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,170
To begin, you must train because evil can come to attack at any moment.

375
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,770
What? Anime original evil?

376
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:57,010
That's right, since we don't know when anime original evil
will show up in the anime, Hayate no Gotoku!

377
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,700
They will?

378
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,920
Bye bye.

379
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,260
Hayate, I have a favor to ask.

380
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,910
Yes, what is it Milady?

381
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,920
Could you put these clothes on?

382
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,930
Um, that's a sailor uniform, right?

383
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:13,250
Oh Nagi, what are you doing?

384
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,150
Maria-san!

385
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,840
Hayate-kun would look better in this frill.

386
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,110
Noooooo!

387
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,760
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku!

388
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,700
Cat Ear Mode Sends You to Hell.

389
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,880
I'll serve the Earth's future ~nyan.
