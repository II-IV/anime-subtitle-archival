1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,330
When watching TV,

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,810
make sure the room is well lit,

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,050
and watch from a distance.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,020
Got it?

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,020
Kuzuha-sama, please give me another chance!

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,050
I, the butler of modern tops, will go.

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,300
No, I, the butler of mecha beetles with wheels, will go.

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,030
No, I, the butler of mountain bike fighters, will go.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,540
No, to be honest, I'm a little tired of this.

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,860
What?

11
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,970
Shion. If I am correct,
our school's culture festival is coming up, right?

12
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,240
Yes. Preparations for stands have begun at many places.

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,740
Such as sweet shops.

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,810
Then it's time to go steal them.

15
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,190
Please hold on.

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:59,100
Allow me, the second of the Unrelated to Kids Hobby Faction, to defeat Ayasaki Hayate.

17
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,670
Don't make me repeat myself. I'm tired of this.

18
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,510
There's something I'd like to give you.

19
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,070
Hey, those are the cakes sold at a store from that town in the last episode.

20
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,610
Not bad.

21
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,790
Do as you like.

22
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,390
Yes Ma'am.

23
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,530
One who masters being a butler becomes the master of the world.

24
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:29,300
The Butler War that shakes the planet has started!

25
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,930
It's KOTOKO whether you read it forward or backwards.

26
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,410
Just so you know, she's now starting a band.

27
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,280
It's done.

28
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,530
I barely made it in time.

29
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,630
All right, today, I will  go back
to the mansion and see Milady's face.

30
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,220
Hey, Hayata-kun, where are you going?

31
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,760
The school building's that way.

32
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,280
I love festivals!

33
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,590
Student Council Chairman Red!

34
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,160
Vice-Chairman Blue!

35
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,430
Disciplinary Committee Member Black!

36
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,590
The three of us make up...

37
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,230
The Student Council!

38
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,770
You get to shake hands with us at the event hall!

39
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,800
SFX: Oh~~~

40
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,010
Good morning.

41
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,480
I didn't expect you to really get the archway done overnight.

42
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,710
Yes, it was well worth our efforts of crying to you after not doing anything for days.

43
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:03,360
If it didn't get done, we would have been yelled at by Hina-chan.

44
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,370
I'm glad this was finished without any trouble.

45
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,130
Well, excuse me now.

46
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,050
Hey, where do you think you're going?

47
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,680
We need you to work more in the classroom, too.

48
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,850
U-Um...

49
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,890
Sorry we made you work like a slave alone.

50
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,610
So as atonement, let us perspire with you.

51
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,770
Here. This is for finishing the archway.

52
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,040
We're really, really relying on you.

53
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,980
Then let's hurry.

54
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,170
We need to prepare for the opening.

55
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,190
He's so understanding.

56
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,830
Okay, off we go.

57
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,670
Oh, Nagi. What are you doing here?

58
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,500
Can't you tell just by looking?

59
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,760
It's a solo culture festival.

60
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,450
I-I think you have the wrong interpretation of "culture".

61
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,510
You're right, Hakuou Academy's
culture festival starts today, doesn't it?

62
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,670
I wonder if Hayate-kun stayed there last night, too.

63
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,460
It seems so.

64
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:20,120
I bet he couldn't refuse anyone and got a mountain of work.

65
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,960
Seriously, there's a limit to being nice.

66
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,380
Hayate is my butler.

67
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,360
He doesn't have to work for everyone like he does.

68
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,770
I see.

69
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,950
If it's bothering you like that, how about
you go take a look at the culture festival?

70
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,610
It's not bothering me.

71
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,120
I don't like crowded places, either.

72
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,060
I heard Hayate-kun will be running a cosplay cafe.

73
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,950
I'm sure he's becoming a popular figure by now.

74
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,540
C-Cosplay cafe, eh?

75
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,600
Sign: Customer

76
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,740
What? An order?

77
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,950
I'm in despair!

78
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,640
Sensei!

79
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,150
No, I mean Master!

80
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,600
No, no. I've still got a ways to go.

81
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,710
Well fine. If you're so worried about Hayate's well-being...

82
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,520
...then I guess I'll go check on him myself.

83
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,840
Yes, thank you very much.

84
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,270
Call the SPs. We'll leave as soon as I get changed.

85
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,800
Nagi still has many childish sides to her.

86
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,170
Or, maybe not?

87
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,020
Th-This is...

88
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,760
Hakuou Academy's culture festival happens once a year.

89
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,940
It's a huge event and attraction within the S-ward in Tokyo.

90
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:44,950
After all, it's a prestigious school, so famous politicians and celebrities come one after another.

91
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:50,390
It goes beyond the league of regular culture festivals and invites excellent guests.

92
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:59,660
And, due to the high level of research presentations, corporate spies and intelligence from around the world pay attention.

93
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,240
SFX: BO~OM

94
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,890
In any case, it's a very cultured three-day culture festival.

95
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,710
May I have another cup of royal milk tea?

96
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,220
Certainly. Please wait just a moment, Milady.

97
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,610
Yes. How may I help you?

98
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,360
Ah, yeah, you. Bring me more tea here, too.

99
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,930
In a pot.

100
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,550
Yes, right away.

101
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,430
Wait, you three! Why are you playing cards?

102
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,770
Your maneuvers are too fast for us to keep up.

103
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,170
Revolution!

104
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,590
I thought we'd stay out of the professional's way.

105
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,100
Revolution counter!

106
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,590
D-Don't say that and please work!

107
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,320
Besides, this is more like a butler cafe than a cosplay cafe.

108
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,220
We are cosplaying.

109
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:59,030
Um, did you purposely make it into a butler cafe so you can dump everything onto me?

110
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,660
It's not good to fall into paranoia, Hayata-kun.

111
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,630
Okay, since we've regained our energy, let's get back to business.

112
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,470
Sh-She's right. Good work, Hayata-kun.

113
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,190
You can get some rest.

114
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,770
Then I'll make a run back to the mansion.

115
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,510
Ayasaki-kun!

116
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,990
Are you here? You're here, right?

117
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,450
Hi, Katsura-sensei.

118
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,840
There he is!

119
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,980
If you're here, then come with me!

120
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,760
Right now!

121
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,610
Wait-

122
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,290
Hey, Nagi-chan.

123
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:39,550
Hey, Hayate. So you know, I didn't come because I wanted to see you or anything like that.

124
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,130
I came since Maria asked me to check on you.

125
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,960
Hayata-kun isn't here.

126
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,280
He just got kidnapped by Yukiji.

127
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,420
What? Hayate's not here?

128
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,440
And I came all the way to see him.

129
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,700
We haven't seen anything from the superintendent so far.

130
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,000
That's good. But maintain the alert.

131
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,720
Yes.

132
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,900
It's a festival we're talking about.

133
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,430
There's no way she'll stay quiet.

134
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,660
Ayasaki-kun, what about this?

135
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,500
You do this and that, then this and that, and this goes like that.

136
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,830
How about this?

137
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,850
Get a stamp at the HQ. ASAP.

138
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,990
Hey Ayasaki-kun. You know, I only have five hundred yen on me right now.

139
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,510
Between octopus puffs and okonomiyaki, which should I buy?

140
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,480
I don't know.

141
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,580
Onee-chan!

142
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,560
What is this about?

143
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,260
Why is Hayate-kun trying to organize this mess?

144
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,140
Isn't it your job as a teacher?

145
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,800
W-Well, I didn't know the answers even if they asked me.

146
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,990
And it's a pain in the butt.

147
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,240
Onee-chan!

148
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,660
I'm sorry!

149
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,420
Haruko, can I leave this to you?

150
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,700
I don't mind.

151
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,780
Thank you.

152
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,120
Come with me for a bit, Hayate-kun.

153
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,100
But I haven't given all the directions.

154
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,380
Um, Harukaze-san, about this...

155
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,000
Make your own judgment.

156
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,670
How about this?

157
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,190
I will not take it out of budget.

158
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:21,790
Here.

159
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,740
My thanks for taking care of them.

160
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,410
Um, why?

161
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,300
Because I can see it on your face.

162
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,140
It says "I'm starving."

163
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,770
It's great to be kind to everyone,
but you'll collapse if you push yourself too much.

164
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,050
Hinagiku-san.

165
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,790
H-Hayate-kun?

166
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,100
H-Hayate-kun!

167
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:56,860
What's this, Jor-kun? Don't eat things off the floor too much.

168
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,950
Superintendent!

169
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,720
Hayate is in a crisis.

170
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,810
Meanwhile, Mademoiselle Nagi was...

171
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,350
Seriously, where is Hayate and what is he doing?

172
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,810
SPs. Go and find Hayate.

173
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,260
Welcome.

174
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,530
I'm tired, so I'll be here-

175
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,720
What? Hey, everyone!

176
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,490
Where are you all?

177
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,250
Stupid Hayate.

178
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,360
And I made a resolution to come out of the mansion.

179
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,120
I... I wanted to walk through the festival with you.

180
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,380
You there with the twin tail.

181
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,340
Would you like to stop by for a second?

182
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,420
I don't need a fake reading.

183
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,120
Don't say that.

184
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,130
My accuracy is 100%.

185
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,000
What?

186
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,770
Okay, I guess I'll waste some time here as a break.

187
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:13,280
It's not a bad idea to reconfirm the strength of the bond between Hayate and me.

188
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,790
Very well. Then first, please look into my eyes.

189
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,580
Like this?

190
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,710
Ah, yes, I can see.

191
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,070
I can see your lonely heart.

192
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:39,160
Allow me to take advantage of that.

193
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,860
Just listen to what...

194
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,880
Sanzenin Nagi! You are now my puppet!

195
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,930
Ishiyaki Imo~ Oimo.

196
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,930
Ishiyaki Imo~ Oimo. = Roasted sweet potatoes. Potatoes.

197
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,930
Mou. Chotto dakeyo.

198
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,930
Mou. Chotto dakeyo. = Gosh. Just a little, okay?

199
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,400
Hayate-kun, are you all right?

200
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,200
Y-Yes, I somehow managed.

201
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,180
Here's a souvenir from inside.

202
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,910
To be fine even after being dunked in Jor-kun's digestive juices.

203
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,290
Jor-kun?

204
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,670
Jormungandr.

205
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,370
It's his name.

206
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:31,220
His favorite foods are the five main lands, three great oceans, and anything alive.

207
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,170
And butlers are his choice out of everything.

208
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,160
I'm only joking.

209
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,650
Besides, this is airing in a time slot
where we should be considerate of young audiences.

210
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:45,000
I really couldn't take that as a joke.

211
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,370
Besides, what is with her strange getup?

212
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,200
Superintendent, what are you planning to do now?

213
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,210
Nothing. I'm off-duty right now.

214
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,190
Ehem. She's off-duty right now.

215
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:01,660
But, it's a different story if someone else entertains me.

216
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:08,810
Hey, kid. I heard you returned the 100 credits you received as your prize from the Butler Tournament.

217
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,890
What's your reason?

218
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,080
Well, I don't need them.

219
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,880
And it's not good for Milady's educational purposes.

220
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,870
Milady.

221
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,220
Milady!

222
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,380
Milady!!!

223
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,460
Is "Milady" all you have in your life?

224
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,610
You're much more boring that I'd thought you were.

225
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,700
Who cares? Let's forget about him now.

226
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,830
Excuse me for a moment.

227
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,590
Hello?

228
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,560
Hayate-kun. Are you with Nagi right now?

229
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,700
What? You mean Milady's at school right now?

230
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,230
Yes. She should have arrived there quite a bit ago by now.

231
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,640
But she left her cell phone behind,
so I tried to get in touch with the SPs, but...

232
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,090
Erina-chan is the best.

233
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,900
The best. The best.

234
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,250
Erina-chan is the best. The best.

235
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,670
Is something wrong, Hayate-kun?

236
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,260
Yes. It looks like Milady has gone missing.

237
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,620
What are you talking about? She's been there for a while now.

238
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,780
There she is!

239
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,760
M-Milady?

240
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,630
Hayate. There's a place I want you to come with me to.

241
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:32,580
Hayate. There's a place I want you to come with me to.

242
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,430
Hayate. There's a place I want you to come with me to.

243
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,890
Obviously something looks wrong.

244
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,230
Y-Yes.

245
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,940
Anyway, I have urgent business, so excuse me.

246
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,750
Wait, I'll go, too.

247
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,380
Um, Kuzuha-sama. Was that...

248
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,110
It's his doing.

249
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,760
He's better than I'd thought.

250
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,190
This is getting interesting.

251
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,540
We'll follow, Shion!

252
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,050
Oh no, my blood sugar level...

253
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,950
K-Kuzuha-sama!

254
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,190
Hayate. There's a place I want you to come with me to.

255
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:13,180
She's in one of those hypnotic states we see often in manga, right?

256
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,350
Yes.

257
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:18,550
I don't know who it is, but how dare they do this to Milady.

258
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,300
Hey, she stopped.

259
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:25,660
Hayate, that's that, but I want to eat this with you.

260
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,030
M-May I have one, please.

261
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,090
Yeah. It tastes really good.

262
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,680
Is this really hypnosis?

263
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,750
Lady Nagi takes the perplexed two,

264
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,410
walks around the entire campus, and...

265
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,930
Not here.

266
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,750
Not here either.

267
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,230
Not here.

268
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,640
Not here.

269
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,170
Not here.

270
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,740
Not here.

271
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,420
Not here either.

272
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,240
Yes, it's here.

273
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,490
This is where I wanted to bring you.

274
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,120
Th-This is the old building.

275
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,670
Then why didn't you bring us straight here?

276
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,730
Hey! I let you control me just once.

277
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,510
Good job, Sanzenin Nagi.

278
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,200
Well done luring Ayasaki Hayate to me.

279
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,800
You call this luring out?

280
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,590
That outfit! You must be one of-

281
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,390
Indeed!

282
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:29,530
People call me the Mysterious Butler, Puppeteer Limited to Once!

283
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,290
That's so literal.

284
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,250
What is going on?

285
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,910
Milady, please wake up.

286
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,580
It's me, Hayate.

287
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:42,800
Hayate. I wanted to go around the festival with you.

288
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,040
Being alone is boring.

289
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,780
Milady.

290
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,370
That's right. I must capture him and undo the hypnosis.

291
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,480
Eh?!

292
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,100
A robot?

293
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:10,560
Ayasaki Hayate. I will defeat you and regain her trust in us.

294
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,500
Milady!

295
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,350
What is this about?!

296
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,260
What the hell?!

297
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,010
Onee-chan?

298
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,710
Hayate-kun. I'll take care of him.

299
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,830
Take care of Nagi.

300
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,710
Um, where did that shinai come from?

301
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,200
I won't forgive those who disrupt the school's peace!

302
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,070
She's going to fight against a robot with a shinai?

303
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,500
Stop running around so much.

304
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,210
Men!

305
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,390
Th-This girl took out a camera.

306
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,780
Shoot out! Anchor!

307
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,090
Hinagiku-san!

308
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,400
You're mine now.

309
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,070
W-What?

310
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,750
Ow...

311
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,150
Hinagiku-san, don't be so rash.

312
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,950
But I can't forgive him.

313
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,190
Come out of there, now!

314
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,880
I need you to undo Milady's hypnosis.

315
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,030
What are you talking about?

316
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,400
The fight's only just begun.

317
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,290
I will destroy Hakuou Academy!

318
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,110
Oh no, the Spark and the jet engine made the super glue come off!

319
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,350
Um... Ah...

320
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,700
What?

321
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,270
What will I do with Milady?

322
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,290
Nagi!

323
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:29,270
Seriously, Hayate. It's boring to be alone.

324
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,780
Culture festivals can...

325
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,500
Culture festivals like this...

326
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,150
I hate it!

327
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,340
I knew it.

328
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,350
She's still under hypnosis.

329
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,690
I'm the queen of the true Japanese culture.

330
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,310
I will...

331
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:52,480
I will teach you guys Japan's true culture.

332
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,530
T-True...

333
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,130
...culture?

334
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,540
This!

335
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,670
Not limited to summer and winter.

336
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,550
Autumn is the season of festivals!

337
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:04,280
Let there be another festival of Japanese culture!

338
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,750
Very interesting.

339
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,840
Superintendent!

340
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,330
Sanzenin Nagi, right?

341
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:16,020
I see much more potential in you than that butler boy.

342
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,660
Eh?

343
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,370
Show me this true festival you talk of.

344
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,060
Sure.

345
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,120
Milady!

346
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,900
Um-

347
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,380
Don't follow me.

348
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,400
I don't need dinner tonight.

349
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,530
And make sure that midnight show is recorded.

350
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:33,230
What is going on?

351
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,750
Is she really under hypnosis?

352
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,530
Next week, the true culture festival will take place.

353
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,460
Of all people, we'll fight against Lady Nagi.

354
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,840
And for your information...

355
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,190
There goes my boiled egg.

356
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:54,600
They were having their sports day.

357
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,020
Nagi and,

358
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,010
Hayate and,

359
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,250
Nishizawa Ayumu's

360
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,170
Butler Network!

361
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,660
Always the lively one! I'm Sanzenin Nagi.

362
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,890
I'm Ayasaki Hayate.

363
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,200
I'm Nishizawa Ayumu.

364
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,300
So here comes the long awaited Hamster service shot!

365
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,680
I can't wait to see it.

366
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,590
No!

367
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,360
This is a shot taken from a certain ramen shop in the Suginami Ward.

368
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,440
It's a snapshot that reveals the line between finishing and not finishing.

369
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,850
What, you can do this to me...

370
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,140
It's very like you, so I think it's good in its own way.

371
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,180
Hayate-kun~

372
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,420
See you.

373
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,490
Um, this is Hakuou Academy, right?

374
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,990
You agree that it's a strange building, right?

375
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:10,750
We will now sell Sanzenin Nagi's doujinshi at the special school booth.

376
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:15,090
Ayasaki Hayate. If your doujinshi beats us in overall sales, then we will-

377
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,940
So this is a doujinshi sales showdown.

378
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,540
My manga can't possibly lose to you!

379
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,150
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

380
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,410
Why Did It Die?! School Festival Part 2.

381
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:29,320
Did you know? At the site of the world's greatest doujinshi event, it's difficult for cell phones to get a signal.
