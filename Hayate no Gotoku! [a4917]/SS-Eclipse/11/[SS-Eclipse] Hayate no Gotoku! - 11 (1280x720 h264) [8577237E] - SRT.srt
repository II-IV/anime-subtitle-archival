1
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:09,370
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,050
Got it?

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,530
Unlike Hayate's morning, the day started peacefully.

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:20,500
But he had no clue that this was the start of
the day that would change the rest of his life.

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,210
Nagi, how about you visit the main house
where your grandfather is once in a while?

6
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,880
It'd be good to introduce Hayate-kun, too.

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,280
And please don't make that spiteful face.

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,520
Who's this grandfather?

9
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,000
The head of the Sanzenin family, Grandfather Mikado.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,190
Head?

11
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,980
In other words, he's the current president of the Sanzenin family.

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,200
Then any mistake I make might lead to me being fired.

13
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:58,440
No, to him, it's easy enough to erase your existence from this world.

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,540
A butler is one who serves.

15
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,010
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,010
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,330
Yes.

18
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:23,910
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

19
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,030
The human body contains a mysterious power.

20
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,670
The more you train...

21
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:13,140
I don't think it's necessary to go say hi to that old man just cause we hired a new butler.

22
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,830
Don't say that.

23
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,110
He's your only blood relative.

24
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:23,520
Man, it's been a while since I last met Old Mikado.

25
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,180
Wait a minute. Why are you even here?

26
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,940
Come on. I'm a relative, you know.

27
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,190
But, what exactly is your grandfather like?

28
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,160
In terms of Dragon **est, he'd be Zo**.

29
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,710
In terms of comedy show, he'd be the ***.

30
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,720
A-Am I going to survive meeting someone that scary?

31
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,540
I'm sure it won't be safe.

32
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,490
If you displease him, he can easily erase the life of a debt-ridden butler.

33
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,380
After all, he forced Com**** to bankruptcy because he founded Pu** Pu**.

34
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,880
And for your information,
********** going down was done by him, as well.

35
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,380
Seriously?

36
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,260
She's lying, of course.

37
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,230
Anyways, he's like a half-ghost, so don't get possessed by some strange thing he may say.

38
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,120
Yes...

39
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,700
What's that?

40
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:21,410
Just to let you know, it's not
Toxic-Apple-Eating-Princess Castle at Mouseland.

41
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,160
Sanzenin Mikado-sama.

42
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,880
It's the Grandfather's house.

43
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,540
What country are we in?

44
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,420
What does he do for a living?

45
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,060
Oil baron?

46
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,190
That's not an occupation.

47
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,060
Hayate was coming to an understanding now.

48
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,820
Nagi wasn't an ordinary rich girl on the street.

49
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,840
Welcome home, Lady Nagi.

50
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,350
Yeah, I'm home.

51
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,340
She's a super rich girl.

52
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,780
But they're so uptight.

53
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,540
Sakuya-sama, Maria-dono.
You must both be tired from the long travel.

54
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,690
We're fine, thank you.

55
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,560
Please head on.

56
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,290
By the way, I'm sorry to interrupt you when you've just returned, but...

57
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,210
...what should we do about this unauthorized individual?

58
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,220
He had snuck onto the helicopter.

59
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,030
What a really suspicious-looking guy.

60
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,720
I understand what you mean, but he's fine.

61
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,720
He's my new butler who replaced Himegami.

62
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,700
This guy who looks like he has no luck with money?

63
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,490
Leave me alone.

64
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,880
But... um...

65
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,460
Hayate resisted.

66
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:47,600
Because it's absolutely true
that he has no money and a poor-man's face.

67
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
You don't have to highlight it like that.

68
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,230
But that was hilarious.

69
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,000
Saku, don't laugh too much.

70
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,740
It's fine; I was aware that I'd come to the wrong place.

71
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,780
Don't take it so personally. They only said what they saw and meant no harm.

72
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,220
Exactly. It's only a waste of time to worry over it.

73
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:16,060
Yes, I do have a 150 million yen debt,

74
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,890
but do I appear to be that detached from money?

75
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,900
A thoughtful mind is more important in this world.

76
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,700
Every individual has to think about the Earth's future.

77
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,830
They're avoiding eye contact.

78
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:35,570
Oh yeah, Nagi. You can't possibly be in those clothes to meet your grandfather.

79
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,520
You're right.

80
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,460
I'll get changed, so you go get some fresh air outside.

81
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,750
Yes...

82
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,090
I got kicked out.

83
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,250
I don't see the point in saying this now,

84
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:59,510
but isn't it dangerous to let
a debt-ridden guy like me walk around loose here?

85
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,510
Is this an expensive thing?

86
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,610
What a nice sound.

87
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:12,780
Maybe I can repay the entire 150 million yen with this.

88
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:19,720
That vase is only about 5 million yen over Yah** ***tion, so it won't be enough to pay the debt off.

89
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,160
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

90
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,760
It was only a thought.

91
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:36,670
Don't worry. I can tell by looking at you
that you're not the kind of person who would do such a thing.

92
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,680
Hey, stop looking at me with those
"hey, what's this old fart saying?" eyes.

93
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,910
I'm sorry.

94
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,140
And, you are?

95
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,940
I live here.

96
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,920
And right now, I'm taking care of the garden.

97
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,650
I see, so you're the landscaper of the house.

98
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:59,410
You don't believe in my eye, do you?

99
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,800
Just so you know-

100
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,230
Oops, I'm sorry.

101
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:11,940
All right, I'll show you how accurate my eyes are, so follow me.

102
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:16,730
His face is sparkling like that of a child.

103
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,020
Look!

104
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,830
Maria, these clothes are a little big.

105
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,160
That's what I thought.

106
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,050
That's called peeping!

107
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,360
You need daily training to improve your eyes.

108
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,200
What kind of criminal do you intend to become after all the training?

109
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:52,850
But I don't understand how you ended up
with a debt of 150 million yen.

110
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,680
It was originally a debt my parents made from gambling.

111
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:04,920
My parents are total losers
and gave me as a present to very kind people.

112
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,490
Then Lady Nagi paid the debt off for me.

113
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,160
So right now, I'm in the process of paying her back over the course of forty years.

114
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,130
I see.

115
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,770
I'm really grateful to Lady Nagi,

116
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:22,250
so you shouldn't be doing things like peeping.

117
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,360
I'll be off now.

118
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:35,150
So in other words, your life is infinitely worthless, I take it.

119
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,600
You're rather boring for a man Nagi has laid her eyes on.

120
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,820
Mister, who are you?

121
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,110
My eyes are the real thing.

122
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:59,780
I've foreseen the economy breaking down,
changes in government, and ****-chan balding, too.

123
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:05,050
I had even foreseen the younger sister boom coming from before the start of World War Two.

124
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,890
And my eyes are telling me.

125
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,150
Your life is even more worthless than those of your trashed parents.

126
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,740
I, Sanzenin Mikado, will give you my words.

127
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,970
My life is worthless?

128
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,560
Yes, it's worthless.

129
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,710
A life spent to repay a debt is infinitely worthless.

130
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:36,580
But if you still wish to make your life worthwhile...

131
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,820
Wh-What's this?

132
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,060
A levistone?

133
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,280
NO! That's a guide!

134
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,800
If you think your life is not worthless,

135
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,850
then keep that on until
the necessary day comes and do not lose it.

136
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:03,020
And if you can attain what lies beyond its guidance,

137
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,710
then forget 150 million yen.

138
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,190
You can gain a trillion or ten trillion yen.

139
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:22,420
After having his life completely rejected,
can Hayate walk to the wards the pendant guides him to?

140
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,760
To be continued in the second half.

141
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,360
Wait.

142
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,600
Hey Maria! Are we sure we don't need a gag?

143
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,690
Oh please, did I ever do any gags before?

144
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,860
No! I can't handle this!

145
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,810
There has to be at least one gag per minute, or else my Kansai blood won't let me be still.

146
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,950
Don't run away! I can't settle down!

147
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,600
That form of gag is already old.

148
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,800
Let me say this clearly.

149
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,150
It's cheap.

150
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,920
Zip it!

151
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,850
Land flat on your face!

152
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,190
Sorry, nothing happened.

153
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,480
Lambada

154
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,810
Dankai no sedai = Baby-Boomer Generation

155
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,810
Dankai no sedai

156
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:13,040
My granddaughter. Do you seek the Sanzenin estate?

157
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:19,050
I don't really need it, but I'd be glad to see you leave this world soon.

158
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,300
Maria! Maria! My granddaughter is bullying me.

159
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,920
Oh, what trouble we have.

160
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,410
I'm not bullying him.

161
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,730
Gramps, I don't need the estate, so can you give me some cash?

162
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,350
Besides, even without it,

163
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:37,690
as long as I have World Business Satellite
and the stock market, I won't have trouble with money.

164
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,170
Damn her. She's gaining unnecessary knowledge every year.

165
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,510
You're the one who taught me to gain this knowledge.

166
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,060
But...

167
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:54,220
I don't remember teaching you to draw a worthless manga like this!

168
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,010
Where did you get my manga from?!

169
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:04,110
See, my granddaughter bullies me.

170
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,130
Yes, yes.

171
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,730
Oh, but Grandfather, why are you bringing this up all of a sudden?

172
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,770
Oh, that's because, at this rate,

173
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,710
Nagi will die.

174
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,620
D-Do I have a winning popsicle?

175
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,550
All right, this one's real!

176
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,570
Score!

177
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,000
So ominous.

178
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,050
Because of what my parents were like, I'm always thinking about money.

179
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,470
I never spared a single thought for my life.

180
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,950
But, is that really all right with my life?

181
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,160
A life spent only to pay off debt...

182
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,470
Hayate!

183
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,370
Milady.

184
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,880
I looked all over for you.

185
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,570
Let's go home now.

186
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,730
What? We're returning already?

187
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,700
Yeah. I can't possibly spend any more time with that old man.

188
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,030
Did something happen?

189
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,170
Not yet, but rather will happen, I guess.

190
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,350
What's going to happen?

191
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,760
W-What is this person?

192
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,230
So he really came.

193
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:52,380
You're pretty good to dodge my sword.

194
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,250
Wh-Who is this fake foreigner?

195
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,710
It'd be a long story to tell,

196
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:03,950
but he's someone who might inherit the entire Sanzenin estate.

197
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,050
Inherit it all?

198
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,920
So basically...

199
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,100
The story won't go anywhere if we leave Nagi to do the explanation, so-

200
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,000
What?!

201
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,530
So let's just have you watch what happened after we left off.

202
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,150
Oh, but Grandfather, why are you bringing this up all of a sudden?

203
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,160
Oh, that's because, at this rate,

204
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,080
Nagi will die.

205
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,870
Huh? Why will I die?

206
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,350
Have you finally developed dementia, old foggy?

207
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,500
I have not developed dementia, and I'm not a "foggy" either.

208
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,830
Think about it for a second, my granddaughter.

209
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,190
I don't have much time ahead of me.

210
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,310
And when I die, the entire estate will go to you,

211
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,930
but there are many within the family that do not like that.

212
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,910
Yes, there are parents out there that would sell their son for 150 million yen,

213
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,670
so there could be those who may come after Nagi's life.

214
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,170
Exactly.

215
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,030
That's why I've come to a conclusion.

216
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:09,410
When a certain condition is met,
the estate will be given to this certain person.

217
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,880
Oh. And that condition is?

218
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,370
And that condition is...

219
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,800
I'm sorry.

220
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:27,330
I lose. I'll give you all the estate,

221
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,950
so please forgive me.

222
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,070
Make Nagi cry and apologize.

223
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,620
I'd rather die than utter such embarrassing words!

224
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,670
It's hard for me to understand what rich people think.

225
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,940
Don't worry, I don't understand, either.

226
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,260
Therefore...

227
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,360
Cry and apologize to me!

228
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,700
Who'd apologize to you, idiot!

229
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,730
Please cry and apologize to me!

230
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,480
Does he not have any pride at all?

231
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,950
It's useless to do that. Go home now.

232
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:18,920
I see. Then you leave me with no choice.

233
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,690
What are you doing to Hayate!

234
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,560
From what old Mikado tells me,

235
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,540
if I beat down that wimpy looking butler,
there's a chance our Lady will cry and apologize.

236
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,490
So I'll smack him down and make the estate mine!

237
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:52,750
If Milady can't inherit the Sanzein estate,

238
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,970
she won't be as rich as she is anymore, right?

239
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,450
Then that'll make her alone.

240
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,680
She'll end up on the street like me.

241
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,850
The porridge is ready.

242
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,520
I'm sorry for all the trouble, Maria.

243
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,750
We promised not to say that, right?

244
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,750
If only Hayate-kun would pay the money back...

245
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:26,140
I shouldn't have lent him 150 million yen.

246
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,190
Such a thing could happen.

247
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,060
Watch out, Hayate!

248
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,090
Prepare yourself!

249
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,100
Money...

250
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,060
Money...

251
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,870
Damn it. Take this.

252
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,840
Money...

253
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:51,280
A life spent to repay the debt is infinitely worthless.

254
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,490
Worthless.

255
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,540
Worthless.

256
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,350
Milady, who came to save me wearing such a hilarious mask.

257
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,230
Milady, who took care of me so earnestly.

258
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:10,500
I can't let Milady have an unpleasant life because of me.

259
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,500
I'll come up with a way to repay the debt soon.

260
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,470
And right now, I need to save her.

261
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,480
I don't know the meaning behind my life yet,

262
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,210
but right now, it's about her!

263
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,180
Why you!

264
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,600
Universe!

265
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,950
Ha... Hayate.

266
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,020
I'll protect you.

267
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:10,900
I'll protect you from anyone who tries to make you cry.

268
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,420
Is that all right with you?

269
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,320
Ah...

270
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,510
Um...

271
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,540
That's...

272
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,750
Well...

273
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,990
Th-Thank you very much.

274
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:50,220
What? This is going to become
a battle anime starting next episode?

275
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,600
No, it won't.

276
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:04,010
The boy lets go of his hesitation
and finds meaning in protecting his master.

277
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,500
Where is butler Hayate's future?

278
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:11,220
Next time, we'll fight against many issues.

279
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,700
Don't lose that pendant, boy.

280
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,970
Anyway...

281
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,980
Maria's gone...

282
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:23,930
That hurt.

283
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,360
What, you're still here?

284
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,710
I didn't get any cash off of you, yet.

285
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,720
Rather than that, how do you plan on going back?

286
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,540
Everyone's up there already.

287
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:41,050
They left me behind?

288
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,680
SFX: Swooooosh....

289
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:49,210
What a cold, cruel world!

290
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,900
Nagi and...

291
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,750
Hayate's...

292
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,290
Butler Network!

293
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,870
Unfortunately, today's the last day for Maria's song.

294
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,530
Eh? Really?

295
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,730
Next week, that character's finally showing up!

296
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,570
Would that happen to be the person
who ranked 1st in the popularity ranking, Hina-

297
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,970
No!

298
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,700
Hayate-kun, it'll be Nagi from next week.

299
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,060
But considering this is my last chance,
aren't I being rather badly mistreated?

300
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,980
Look forward to next week!

301
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,480
Bye bye

302
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,240
Um, you're Hayate-kun, right?

303
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,260
Nishizawa-san.

304
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,920
It's been since Christmas we last met. What were you doing until now?

305
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,110
Well, a lot has happened, and I'm working as a butler at a certain mansion.

306
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,800
What? Is that supposed to be a joke?

307
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,660
But I'm glad I got to see your face.

308
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,470
I'm really happy.

309
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,430
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

310
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:21,520
We Were Once Taught by the Space Police That Youth is to Not Look Back.

311
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,310
But Hayate-kun, I... I...

312
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,380
You'll get to see a new type of conflict!
