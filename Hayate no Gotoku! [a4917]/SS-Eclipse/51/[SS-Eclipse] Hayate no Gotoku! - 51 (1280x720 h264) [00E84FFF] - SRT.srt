1
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,920
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,390
Mister Ayasaki.

3
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,570
I will give these ¥150,000,000 as a gift to you.

4
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,360
Who could this mysterious man be?

5
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,920
Continues on to next week's final episode!

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,990
Hey, this week's just starting!

7
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,860
The story flashes back to several hours ago.

8
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,890
Everyone, rise!

9
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,800
Listen! Make sure to fill this S-Ward in Tokyo with astonishment.

10
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,050
Ready to sing the school anthem?

11
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,440
Yeah!

12
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,250
Suginami no chi wo shihai suru

13
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,250
It rules the city of Suginami

14
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,660
It was a long, yet short, year.

15
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,780
Shiroki manabiya

16
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,780
The white academic building

17
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,090
But I'm really glad I was able to move on to the next grade.

18
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:55,250
Yes. With all the studying he did,
Hayate managed to pass his final exams.

19
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,710
Waga bokou

20
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,710
My school

21
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,260
Muneno enjin hi wo tsukete

22
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,260
Get the engine in your heart working.

23
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,020
What a shame.

24
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,890
Tama, step back.

25
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,960
Chief Butler, please don't play nasty jokes.

26
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,060
Let me repeat myself, Ayasaki.

27
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:13,940
The amount of debt you paid back to
the young miss in this past year is still trivial.

28
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:21,210
If you fail at any point, you will be out on
the street with a debt of ¥150,000,000 again.

29
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,950
Never forget that fact.

30
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,420
Yes, Chief Butler!

31
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,610
Hakuou!

32
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,610
Hakuou!

33
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,180
All right, I'll keep up what I'm doing next year, too.

34
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,090
Hakuou!

35
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,090
Hakuou!

36
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,660
Rokumega mainichi koushin.

37
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,660
6MB marching down every day.

38
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,560
Let's go home, Hayate.

39
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,860
Hakuou Gakuin!

40
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,860
Hakuou Academy!

41
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,860
Wh- Please wait. Milady!

42
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,590
Marvelous.

43
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,730
Honestly, it's just more work for me, but let's all meet again in April.

44
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,800
End of closing ceremony!

45
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,370
Come on, Hayate! Get moving!

46
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,100
If you dilly-dally, I'll leave you behind!

47
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,860
Um, why are you in such a hurry?

48
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,080
Why not enjoy the sense of freedom a little more?

49
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,090
I just want to get home fast and continue playing Mon*** Portable Second G!

50
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,130
Huh?

51
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,450
That's really the only reason why I'm hurrying.

52
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,330
Please wait, Milady.

53
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,420
Looks like Hayate's puzzled.

54
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,980
But this is just the start.

55
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,350
It's my turn again.

56
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,440
What? Milady's important online shopping merchandise?

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,590
Yes. Can you go pick it up from that shop?

58
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,750
You must not look at what's inside.

59
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,840
Yes, ma'am. Right away.

60
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,350
Don't rush so much!

61
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,070
Go stroll out and about and waste some time.

62
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,350
To be specific, until around the evening.

63
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,330
Why?

64
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,480
Wh-Why...

65
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,330
I... I all of a sudden don't want to see your face.

66
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,480
Don't make me repeat myself!

67
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,840
Okay...

68
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,810
Then I will take my time and slowly come back around evening.

69
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,430
N-Nagi.

70
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,110
L-Looks like I was able to trick him well.

71
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,270
I bet Hayate wouldn't guess what he is off to pick up.

72
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,870
Nagi, wasn't that too harsh on him?

73
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,720
Yeah. That debt-ridden butler looked seriously depressed.

74
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,140
D-Don't look at me like that!

75
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,930
Come on everyone! Let's get the preparations started.

76
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,230
Nagi's traps are being set behind the scene.

77
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,070
Meanwhile, at Hakuou Academy...

78
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,690
Yukiji's snoring as usual.

79
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,920
What? Seriously? You'll trade me with Ma***i for ¥50,000,000,000?

80
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:48,630
Kaoru-sensei, who has appeared after eighteen episodes of absence, is making Gun*** models as always.

81
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,190
And, ten thousand meters above the ground...

82
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,410
Kuzuha-sama, we'll be arriving at our destination by tomorrow noon as scheduled.

83
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:03,170
Good. We must get our hands on this rumored item no matter what.

84
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,610
What exactly is the legendary item?

85
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,840
A mask made in ancient times by a sorcerer.

86
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,450
If you put it on, a strange power takes effect and one grows taller.

87
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,500
You're nice short,

88
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,600
but I would like to see your handsome version again.

89
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,230
Kuzuha-sama~

90
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,100
Shion.

91
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,690
Africa, eh?

92
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,930
I hope they come home safely before the new school year starts.

93
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,240
Chiharu-san, are you saying that for real?

94
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,820
Don't say things like that.

95
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,530
Even if she is like that, she is
an indispensable person at the school.

96
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,820
How exactly?

97
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,620
In what way?

98
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,720
Right, let's go have some tea.

99
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,610
I'll treat you to cake if you want.

100
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,690
With pleasure.

101
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:56,380
Then let us have a little party with just the three of us.

102
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,600
Come to think of it, I didn't see Hayate-kun today.

103
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,240
Looks like he was able to move on to the next grade,
so I wanted to congratulate him.

104
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,380
What could this be?

105
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:21,750
Judging from Milady's attitude... Did I mess something up again?

106
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,830
H-Hey! What? What is this?

107
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,930
Let me go!

108
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,000
Welcome, Mister Ayasaki.

109
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,370
I'm sorry for the rough handling.

110
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,910
Who are these people?

111
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,620
Could they be after what Milady ordered?

112
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,340
Victoria Elizabeth Steward Dispatch Company?

113
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:11,670
Yes. We are the largest international butler dispatch company.

114
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,280
I've never heard of such a company!

115
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,000
We have been observing you through a certain source.

116
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,320
When were these filmed?

117
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,980
The ones who filmed these were...

118
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,010
Ready?

119
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,820
Us!

120
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,150
Did you enjoy them?

121
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:37,480
The Hakuou Academy Motion Picture Research Club lives forever!

122
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,830
I see...

123
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,450
Mister Ayasaki.

124
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,770
I will give you these ¥150,000,000 as a gift to you.

125
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,750
The story finally returns to where we started the episode.

126
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,330
I am here to headhunt you into our company.

127
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,960
This is your hiring bonus.

128
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,050
Take it so you can pay off your debt to the Sanzenin family.

129
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,790
You even went as far as researching that?

130
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,120
No, thank you!

131
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,380
I already promised Milady
I would pay the debt back by working.

132
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:18,650
Are you sure? You may never get a chance like this again.

133
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:27,450
If you truly care about your Lady, shouldn't you use this money to pay the debt off as soon as possible?

134
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,150
Well...

135
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,650
Contact me anytime.

136
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,580
I'll be waiting to hear a favorable answer from you.

137
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:55,480
Keep it coming! Keep it coming!

138
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,330
What, Tama? More to the right?

139
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:04,190
God... Why do we have to help out?

140
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,290
A-Are you all right, Isumi?

141
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,660
Oops, my hands slipped.

142
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,560
Hey! You!

143
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,930
Man, accidents are scary.

144
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,660
What a merry day.

145
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,930
Continuing to part B.

146
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,970
Nagi da zo!

147
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,970
Nagi da zo~! = I'm Nagi!

148
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,910
Ojyou-sama, honto ha ato ikura desuka, bokuno shakkin?

149
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,910
Ojyou-sama, honto ha ato ikura desuka, bokuno shakkin? = Milady, how much more do I owe you, exactly?

150
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,140
May never have another chance like this, eh?

151
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,110
He's right. For me to continue to stay with the Sanzenin family...

152
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,470
It might just be my selfishness.

153
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,480
Heck, it's no time for me to brood!

154
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,280
Right now, I must take this to Milady.

155
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,070
Eh?!

156
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,880
Okay! It's perfect this time!

157
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,880
Oh my.

158
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,120
This is...

159
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,780
It's good, isn't it?

160
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,670
Iffy.

161
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,630
Yes. It's not good per se, but it's not inedible.

162
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:33,310
Gosh! What's that reaction!
I put everything I had into making it!

163
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,860
But Nagi, why are you holding this large event?

164
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:41,260
Because now might be the only chance to do it.

165
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,060
Maria! Get me that maximum tomato!

166
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,520
That thing fully recovers one's health,

167
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,020
so I want to let Hayate have it.

168
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,690
Yes, yes.

169
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,750
I worked hard on my finals, too.

170
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:05,390
Stop complaining. Just celebrate
a fellow member who studied with you.

171
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,050
Hey, Sakuya.

172
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,410
Thanks for giving me the spot in Hakuou.

173
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,710
I always wanted to say it.

174
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:19,150
I-I will pay this favor back when I become a bigshot!

175
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,170
Stop acting like a different character!

176
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,220
You're just a brat!

177
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,260
I don't need anything! Just keep it!

178
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,420
Damn, the debt-ridden butler's slow.

179
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,630
What's taking him so long?

180
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,100
Itadakimasu!

181
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,630
There's nothing inside!

182
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,830
Is this a form of a lucky choice?

183
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,850
If so, I might be able to meet Hayate-kun.

184
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,620
Hayate-kun!

185
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,450
Nishizawa-san.

186
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,990
May I borrow that bicycle?

187
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,540
I promise to return it later.

188
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,580
Y-Yes!

189
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,070
All right, I caught up.

190
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,810
Ready, Eight?

191
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:14,410
There!

192
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,980
The dream has spoken to me! I'll become a major leaguer!

193
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,850
Go!

194
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,070
Sir, this is how you hold it.

195
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,860
Okay, I get it, Nonohara.

196
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,990
Cha! Shuu! Men!

197
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,790
Sir's not around today, so I guess I'll make something simple for dinner.

198
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,940
Hello, it's been a while since we met.

199
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,830
Yes...

200
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:47,630
Ah, this is... It's the 100th Master Gr*de series.

201
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:53,590
I totally thought they were Gun*** V or V2, so I could never get myself to buy these.

202
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,680
Saki-san!

203
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,900
Hello, Hayate-san.

204
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,740
Did you see a small box around here?

205
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,500
What?

206
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,190
Saki-san?

207
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,930
What's this?

208
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,720
Hayata-kun.

209
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,190
Hello all.

210
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,060
Can I have that box back?!

211
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,050
It belongs to him?

212
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,870
Then I can't imagine anything good's inside.

213
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,010
All right.

214
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:20,940
Catch!

215
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,320
Right here.

216
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,770
Ah, sorry.

217
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,390
I met Hayate-kun, but couldn't talk very much.

218
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,030
Perfect. Nishizawa-san, let me return you the bike now.

219
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,930
Thank you very much. It was very helpful.

220
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:42,710
Excuse me!

221
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,200
Hayate-kun... I'll be able to meet you again, won't I?

222
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,590
I look forward to working with you all next school year, too.

223
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,770
Yes. Good job to all.

224
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:58,240
Chiharu-san, if you're happy, you should show it on your face.

225
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,100
H-Hayate-kun?

226
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,250
What's happening?

227
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,730
Why did you come falling from the sky?

228
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:10,290
Ah, Hinagiku-san. I tried to jump onto
the next building, but my foot slipped.

229
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:10,760
The cake... My cake... My cake's squashed...

230
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
Huh?

231
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,530
Oh well. Um, Hayate-kun.

232
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,450
Congratulations on being able to move up a grade.

233
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,930
I'm sorry. I'm in a little hurry.

234
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,250
I'll see you when the new semester starts!

235
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,490
The cake...

236
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,090
I guess that's a penalty for him.

237
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,270
We'll have to bill him later.

238
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,240
Gosh! What's wrong with him?!

239
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,410
Wh-What is this series of misfortunes that hasn't happened in a while?

240
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,990
It's as if I'm being tested by something.

241
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,620
This is bad. That was a flock of geese.

242
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,090
Geese are large water birds categorized as anatidae, anseriformes.

243
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:50,730
They usually come down south from Siberia in autumn to spend the winter and head back north in spring.

244
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,480
At this rate, Milady's important item will get taken to Siberia.

245
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,870
All right, I guess I'll have to try it.

246
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:27,740
H-Himuro! I'm looking forward to learning Samba over the break!

247
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,070
You're already very good at it, Sir Taiga.

248
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,020
Himuro-san... That box...

249
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,380
Please give that box back to me...

250
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,550
I will depending on the situation, but are you sure about this?

251
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,460
This ship's heading for Brazil.

252
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,180
I was about to get taken away to the other side of the Earth.

253
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,540
But I can finally give this to Milady.

254
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,020
Wait, Tama!

255
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,990
Come, follow me!

256
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,680
Wait!

257
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,390
Now! Do it, Tama!

258
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,800
Banners: Ayasaki Hayate-kun!!  Congratulations on moving up a grade!!

259
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,340
Th-This is...

260
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,510
Go up already, Ayasaki. Everyone's waiting.

261
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,750
Um, what is this?

262
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,780
You're pretty dense, eh?

263
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:54,290
The effort was worth it if he's that surprised.

264
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,810
But, why the triumphal arch?

265
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,200
Where did it come from?

266
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,090
Nagi.

267
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,160
Looks like it worked.

268
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,280
Milady.

269
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,630
Maria, bring the item.

270
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,950
Here.

271
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,320
Th-That's!

272
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,310
Hayate, you've done well on your final exams.

273
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,170
This is a present from me.

274
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:19,690
So, this was all a surprise event set up by Nagi.

275
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,390
Open it already.

276
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:25,100
Nagi asked us about it, and we chose it together.

277
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,830
I did my best for the final exam, too, but I didn't get anything.

278
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,950
You'd better feel grateful about this!

279
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,390
Everyone...

280
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,140
I can't accept something this expensive!

281
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,230
What?!

282
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:41,040
I have a debt of ¥150,000,000 to you.

283
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,930
Not only that, but you're even letting me stay at the mansion.

284
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,270
Don't be such a stranger, Hayate!

285
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,220
Milady?

286
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,600
You're right. It'll take approximately another forty years to pay off your debt.

287
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,320
I know that!

288
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,680
That's why I chose that as the present!

289
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,030
It's famous for not breaking even after a hundred years.

290
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,130
Milady...

291
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,380
Hayate! I want to be with you all the time.

292
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,260
Not just forty years, but a hundred or two hundred years!

293
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,730
After all, money isn't the only thing that's keeping us together, is it?

294
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,780
Milady!

295
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,970
H-Hey, everyone's watching!

296
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:31,030
You spat out much more embarrassing lines.

297
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,020
I can't take this.

298
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,110
I see. That is a shame.

299
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:47,280
Well then, I wish you the best luck.

300
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,470
It's as you heard.

301
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:54,480
He turned down our offer. What will you do?

302
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,080
I guess he passes.

303
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:03,050
I was planning on kicking him out of that place if he took the offer.

304
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,520
Looks like he's still qualified to hold on to that.

305
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,560
But, of course, who knows how long it'll last.

306
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,740
How's the stew, Hayate?

307
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,790
Well, I guess it's good.

308
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,360
But you could say it's average.

309
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,430
Hey, I can feel my health getting charged.

310
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,870
HP max!

311
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:29,150
I didn't use that much effort to make your HP max!

312
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,330
Who cares!

313
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,040
Banners: Ayasaki Hayate-kun!!  Congratulations on moving up a grade!!

314
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,780
Please wake up, Milady.

315
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,560
Last night was fun, wasn't it, Hayate?

316
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,090
Yes, thank you very much, Milady.

317
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,430
But hmm, today's the first day of spring break.

318
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:50,700
Okay. Let's all go sakura gazing today.

319
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:54,220
H-How does this place look?

320
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,670
I've wanted to ride a boat every now and then.

321
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,690
Spring is when people's hearts start to frolic.

322
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:04,140
Today, I shall step on to a new stage with Hayate.

323
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,610
I'm really good with boats.

324
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:10,780
I used to work at a marina.

325
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:15,590
Oh boy. These two don't change at all even after a whole year.

326
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,040
Okay, let's go, Hayate!

327
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,410
We need to get a bicycle ready!

328
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,560
Yes, Milady.

329
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,530
Enjoy your trip.

330
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,020
Ready, Milady?

331
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,450
I'm counting on you, Hayate.

332
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,160
The story of the two will continue.

333
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,390
Next week, we'll fight against the Aegean Sea.

334
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,160
Nagi and,

335
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,290
Hayate's

336
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,500
Butler Network! Final Network!

337
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,220
How do you do? I'm Sanzenin Nagi.

338
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,060
I'm Ayasaki Hayate.

339
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,060
So with all that's going to happen, this is the last Butler Network.

340
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,570
So many things have happened up to this day.

341
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,970
And Hayate has grown to become a great butler.

342
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,670
Thank you very much. I think you've grown, too, Milady.

343
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:50,130
D-Don't be ridiculous, you pervert!

344
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,010
What's the matter?

345
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,800
Someone who says stuff like that deserves this!

346
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,740
It's maid Hayate to commemorate the last.

347
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:58,490
The next extra series will be Hayate's Maid Network.

348
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,880
So until we meet again!

349
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,500
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

350
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,470
The final episode.

351
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,990
Radical Dreamers.

352
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,060
Hayate, please stay with me always.

353
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,010
Yes! I hope you take good care of me, too.
