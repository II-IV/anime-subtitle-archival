1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,220
When watching TV,

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,730
make sure the room is well lit,

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,930
and watch from a distance.

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:09,770
Got it?

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,530
Hayate left the mansion?

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,530
Looks like I'll have to find a replacement quickly, then.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,150
Hey!

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,290
Klaus-san.

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,050
He said he's quitting.

10
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,150
It'd be a different story if he had asked for advice.

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,830
Maria, what should I do?

12
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,420
It's because...

13
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,250
...I acted so awkwardly towards him...

14
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,120
Nagi...

15
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,130
Hayate-kun, where did you disappear to?

16
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,560
One who masters being a butler becomes the master of the world.

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:55,100
The Butler War that shakes the planet has started!

18
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,320
The second part of the preview to the final episode is starting.

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,510
Um, is this the only place we get to speak?

20
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,370
Merry Christmas!

21
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,670
Say, Onee-chan, don't tell me you've been drinking since Christmas Eve?

22
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,290
Yes!

23
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,680
Screw a white Christmas!

24
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,970
I'll have it all red instead.

25
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,680
Hina~

26
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,330
Believe it or not, people have given thousands of obl*te to me before!

27
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,000
Assy, Messy, and Nessy!

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,360
All the things college girls do!

29
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,230
But I'm not a college girl anymore.

30
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,400
I'm a teacher!

31
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,010
What age did you live in?

32
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,680
If you're lonely, you should have come home.

33
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,360
Me? Lonely?

34
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,220
Onee-chan!

35
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,790
A white Christmas, eh?

36
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:40,770
Hayate-kun?

37
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,630
What are you doing here?

38
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,260
Nothing. Just came to get things I left in the classroom.

39
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,210
But you look empty-handed to me.

40
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,000
You're a sore loser, Ayasaki-kun.

41
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:02,980
You were bidding farewell to Sanzenin-kun by visiting the classroom.

42
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,190
Am I right?

43
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,640
Farewell?

44
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,180
Have you made up your mind?

45
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,120
I will answer the superintendent personally.

46
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,910
What is this about? What is the superintendent planning?

47
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,490
Well, um...

48
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,790
There was a rumor going through the butler association this fall.

49
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,040
Shion-san!

50
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,710
The rumor says, anyone who defeats the butler
Ayasaki Hayate gains the Sanzenin's huge estate.

51
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,420
I thought it was bogus,

52
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,320
but I might have to think twice on that.

53
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,020
Give me that, Hayate-kun!

54
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,890
Show it to me!

55
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,590
Hey, that's-

56
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,530
Looks like you had a horrible Christmas.

57
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,340
Yes, you could say that.

58
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,690
Could this be...

59
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,980
This is blackmail!

60
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,600
Um, Hinagiku-san.

61
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,100
You make it sound as though we're the villains.

62
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,690
Give me the data.

63
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,810
It's cheating to pick at others' weak points.

64
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,380
Really?

65
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,280
Please stop. Hinagiku-san has nothing to do with this.

66
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,200
What are you saying, Hayate-kun?

67
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,700
Take me away now, will you?

68
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,570
Wait, Hayate-kun!

69
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,490
Please do not mention this to Milady.

70
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,660
Hayate-kun!

71
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,130
This can't be happening.

72
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,340
Welcome, Ayasaki.

73
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,880
Have you decided to become my vassal?

74
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:38,580
If I become your butler, you will give up on the Sanzenin estate?

75
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,110
I will promise you.

76
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,150
But why are you saying that after taking my powers as a butler away?

77
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:48,090
You will be gaining more butler powers than before.

78
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:53,930
And you will be reborn as a perfect butler that swears his body and soul to me.

79
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,970
Hayate...

80
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,570
Yes, this is the Sanzenin estate.

81
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,020
Oh, Hinagiku-san?

82
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,950
What? Hayate-kun is?

83
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,000
Hey, it's me!

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,860
What?

85
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,720
He asked me not to tell you, but I couldn't pretend I didn't see anything.

86
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:21,560
Plus, he looked like he was getting blackmailed over the Sanzenin estate.

87
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,560
Hayate left in order to protect me and the Sanzenin family.

88
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,330
Nagi...

89
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,670
Hayate took everything upon himself!

90
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,530
Butler and master are whole only when they're together.

91
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,610
They must face all hardships and crises together!

92
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:43,130
Then there's only one thing for you to do as Hayate-kun's master.

93
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,120
Yes.

94
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,060
I leave the house in your care, Maria.

95
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:46,560
Yes.

96
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,990
Shion, bring the item.

97
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,570
Yes, Kuzuha-sama.

98
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,860
Th-That's!

99
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:03,570
The treasure among the butlers,
passed down since ancient times.

100
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,980
What could the butler treasure be?

101
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,940
Continues to part B.

102
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,880
Ramipasu Ramipasu Rerererere!

103
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,890
Rerere no re. Genki desuka?

104
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,890
Rerere no re. Genki desuka? = Rerere no re. Are you doing well?

105
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,860
This treasure is something I found when I went to the Amazon.

106
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,660
Amazon?

107
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:34,610
The reason I went there was to get
a hold of the legendary vanilla beans.

108
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:42,540
The cave we found by luck was a ruin of the ancient butler civilization.

109
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,630
Um, what is an ancient butler civilization?

110
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:50,030
But, we did not fear it and marched deeper.

111
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,780
She ignored me.

112
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:59,690
At the deepest part of the cave, the giant snake, Jormungandr, our Jor-kun, was protecting the ancient treasure.

113
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,160
We were enchanted by him
and became guardians of the treasure.

114
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,070
As a result, I gained the power to control white snake magic!

115
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,400
And I gained the power to turn into a man from Jor-kun,

116
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,350
so that we can protect the treasure together.

117
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,640
S-So you're being used by the snake?

118
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,520
They really are  being manipulated.

119
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,520
You should be honored, Ayasaki Hayate.

120
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,580
I will let you see the ancient butler civilization's treasure, too!

121
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,370
This ancient butler robe is still in its slumber.

122
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,970
Shion and I have used countless butlers to test the robe,

123
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:47,130
but no matter how talented the butler we bring, for some reason the robe rejects them,

124
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,340
and they can't even put their arms through the sleeves.

125
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,250
Hey, that's not a butler uniform.

126
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,740
But I'm sure you can wear this robe.

127
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,160
Come. Become a butler who serves us with your body and soul.

128
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,130
I said that's not a butler-

129
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:11,410
So you know, you can't take this robe off once you wear it.

130
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:16,490
And, if you get rejected by the robe,
you'll turn into a white snake as part of the curse.

131
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,170
We'll now start the ceremony.

132
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,810
Elohim Essaim, Elohim Essaim.

133
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,140
I desire and here I moe.

134
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,820
O ancient robe! Awaken!

135
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,760
The ultimate butler uniform is awakening!

136
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,870
Milady!

137
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,560
Look!

138
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,160
Hayate must be there!

139
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,790
Yes ma'am.

140
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,350
She's here.

141
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,600
Hey, over here!

142
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,100
So it's begun?

143
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,360
Hayate, are you all right?

144
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,210
We're here to save-

145
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,750
Is it sweet, my Master?

146
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,660
Yes, it's exquisite.

147
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,470
I'm so happy ~nyan.

148
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,810
Hayate! What's with the outfit?

149
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,320
Oh, we have guests.

150
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,810
I'll prepare some tea right away.

151
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,690
Hayate, do you not recognize...

152
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,850
He's now completely my butler.

153
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,650
Look at the design.

154
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,950
Can't expect better from an ancient civilization's artifact.

155
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,140
Those clothes still count as butler attire?

156
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,830
Anyways, I'm taking Hayate back.

157
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,110
Hey, Hayate!

158
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,040
We'll get him out of those clothes, first of all.

159
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,320
Y-Yeah.

160
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,490
Stay out of the way.

161
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,170
I haff been waifing for 30000 yearf for this snack time.

162
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,770
I see. Your speech totally gives it away.

163
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,220
Exactly.

164
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,610
This snake is manipulating eferyone.

165
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,250
Hey, out of my way!

166
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,580
If you get in my way-!

167
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:17,930
We don't need two mafters for Ayafaki Fayate!

168
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,690
Protect our Lady!

169
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,340
Fho are you?

170
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,410
Himegami!

171
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,290
My name is Princess God.

172
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,990
I was born in darkness, and in darkness I live.

173
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,050
I don't really care.

174
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,650
Take care of him!

175
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:11,480
Hey, Hayate! Take this chance and get yourself out of those ridiculous clothes.

176
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,010
What?

177
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,700
Fine, I'll resort to force.

178
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,690
What are you doing to me?

179
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,720
Just strip him, Nagi.

180
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,320
Yup, I will.

181
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:25,190
Please stop.

182
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,180
She seems to be enjoying it.

183
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,600
But it's still too early for this.

184
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,820
That robe has yet to fully awaken.

185
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,860
What are you planning?

186
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,670
Hinagiku! Himegami!

187
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,070
Nagi!

188
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,480
Hayate is my butler!

189
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,150
I will not give him to anyone!

190
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,850
I don't need my mansion!

191
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,940
I don't need my estate!

192
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,240
Hayate...

193
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:58,510
I'm happy as long as you're with me!

194
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,960
Even if you've lost your powers as a butler...

195
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,060
So...

196
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,370
So please! Wake up!

197
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,150
Hayate!

198
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,770
Hayate, you...

199
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:21,110
I'm sorry, Milady. I'm...

200
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,990
I'm!

201
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,710
Hayate...

202
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,820
I'll have to punish you later.

203
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,940
Yes, Milady!

204
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,560
Hayate!

205
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:38,960
It has begun.

206
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,310
That smart aleck!

207
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,230
Your opponent is me!

208
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,950
S-She's so manfy.

209
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,320
Hayate! Get out of there! Hey!

210
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,680
Don't worry, Milady.

211
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,780
But you've lost your powers as a butler.

212
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,770
It'll be fine. Even if I didn't have anything of the sort,

213
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:20,270
as long as Milady trusts me, I'm...

214
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,280
I'll be a butler!

215
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,330
Hayate!

216
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,450
What is going on?

217
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:35,440
"To awaken the holy butler uniform, he must..."

218
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,660
Eh... how do I read this character?

219
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,120
Give it to me!

220
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,200
Let's see... "he must lose once the powers of a butler."

221
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:53,140
"The treasure sleeps in the form of girls' clothes to test if the individual truly holds the soul of a butler."

222
00:14:53,670 --> 00:15:00,780
"But, when it accepts him truly,
the treasure shall awaken and show its true form."

223
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,350
S-So that's how it worked.

224
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,830
I'd lofe to own this wafkthrough.

225
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:13,150
Besides, there are too many myfteries that you can nefer solve wifout reading wafkthrough these days.

226
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,460
So where did you buy this book?

227
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,530
From Ya*** ***tion.

228
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,640
Oh, it's here, it's really here.
The ultimate butler uniform is finally awakening!

229
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,160
Um... I'm Ayasaki Hayate.

230
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,510
I'm the butler who protects Lady Sanzenin Nagi.

231
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,130
So that's the legendary butler uniform...

232
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,390
What horrible taste.

233
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,110
I've been protecting this for 30000 years?

234
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,890
It's shining brilliantly!

235
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:42,890
It's cool!

236
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,980
You're super cool, Hayate!

237
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,060
Thank you very much, Milady.

238
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,690
Hey! Are you guys blind or something?!

239
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,780
How abominable.

240
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,190
I'll go afean and deftroy that ifem.

241
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,800
I will gain freedom!

242
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,560
Hayate!

243
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,640
Come to me, my original butler ultimate attack!

244
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,780
Here I go!

245
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,890
Hayate.

246
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,830
Milady.

247
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,960
It's dangerous here. Let's go outside!

248
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,310
There goes one of the school's facilities...

249
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,690
Himegami-san!

250
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,520
Thanks to you, I got a hold of this fully awakened item.

251
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,840
Himegami-san...

252
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,040
Take care of Nagi.

253
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,550
Did you use Hayate to get a hold of that?

254
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:20,530
I didn't want to wear it even if it meant dispelling my curse.

255
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:24,760
Besides, what exactly are those golden clothes, Himegami?

256
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,290
I'm not Himegami.

257
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,110
I'm Princess God.

258
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,620
I will save this world one day.

259
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,680
Enough of that!

260
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,370
I only need three more to get the legendary God Butler Dragon.

261
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,570
Gosh. What's wrong with him?

262
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:42,950
But, if it hadn't been for Himegami-san,
I might not have been able to come back.

263
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,840
Yeah, maybe, but...

264
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,140
Wh-Where am I?

265
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,420
What have I been doing all this time?

266
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,600
K-Kuzuha-sama!

267
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,920
Thank goodness!

268
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,840
Looks like the curse wore off of both of them.

269
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,960
So that means...

270
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,830
Hakuou Academy will now become peaceful.

271
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:12,000
Shion, you're not bad at all when you're small.

272
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,870
Kuzuha-sama.

273
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,670
I don't see much of a change in them.

274
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,250
Oh yeah, what happened to that picture?

275
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,090
It's inside here!

276
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,590
The memory card must be broken to pieces by now!

277
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,760
I see. Then be careful on your way back.

278
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,220
I'll be waiting, Nagi.

279
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,970
They must be coming back soon.

280
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,530
Have a wonderful Christmas, both of you.

281
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,560
Hina, you were still here?

282
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:02,450
Huh?

283
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,120
Wow! What the hell is this?

284
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,790
A lot happened.

285
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,770
What are you doing out here at this hour, Onee-chan?

286
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,230
I was out to go buy some chasers.

287
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,330
I thought I'd start drinking again.

288
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,650
Do you want me to come with you?

289
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,790
Oh, but of course, I'll be drinking juice.

290
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,760
Yeah!

291
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,310
Thank you very much, Milady.

292
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,210
It was nothing, really.

293
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,320
Hey, Hayate.

294
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,620
Don't let it bother you so much. Thank you, too.

295
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:46,380
Oh no. I feel too embarrassed all of a sudden to face him.

296
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,120
But this is Christmas, so...

297
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,400
Let's make a stop before we go home!

298
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,250
Merry Christmas.

299
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,810
Everyone, please buy a cake.

300
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:05,680
Hold on, if these don't sell, do I get to keep them?

301
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,720
Um, Milady, why are we here?

302
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,640
You do remember this, right?

303
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,150
Yes, of course.

304
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,400
I've learned a lot in this one year, too.

305
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,530
Look, I can now buy the warm, too.

306
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,260
Hayate, this is for you.

307
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,910
Just take it.

308
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:37,130
See? The warm that we couldn't buy that day is now within our grasp.

309
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:42,350
This is the year that we spent together.

310
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,420
Thank you for the warm every day.

311
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,950
Milady...

312
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,600
Merry Christmas, Hayate.

313
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,660
Merry Christmas to you, too, Milady.

314
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,330
Milady?

315
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,650
What's the matter?

316
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,820
Could it be that you're sleepy?

317
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,490
Ow!

318
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,680
What was that for, Milady?

319
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,610
Damn you, Hayate!

320
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,740
P-Please wait! Milady!

321
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,620
Nagi and Hayate-sama are late.

322
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:28,520
Yeah, really. So much for setting aside time for them.

323
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,500
Let's just start eating.

324
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,720
You can't, Sir.

325
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,580
Welcome home!

326
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,410
All those watching Hayate no Gotoku.

327
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:48,050
Thank you for your long support.

328
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:54,140
Next week starts the fourth season.

329
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,020
Nagi and,

330
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,090
Hayate's

331
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,580
Butler Network!

332
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,740
I'm the creation's dream, Sanzenin Nagi.

333
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,560
I'm Ayasaki Hayate.

334
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,000
Hayate no Gotoku the animation has finally faced its final episode.

335
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,420
Thank you everyone for your support.

336
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,300
Please look forward to the succeeding show.

337
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,220
It's not over yet, Milady.

338
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,130
Just like the famous Hermit said, "It will continue a little longer."

339
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,360
Oh, it will?

340
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,490
What a pain!

341
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:53,010
The fourth season starts from next week on.

342
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:55,750
I will continue to give my all so I can be your best butler.

343
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,410
Y-Yeah, I'm counting on you, Hayate.

344
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,750
Bye-yaya.

345
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:02,750
Hayate!

346
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,560
What's the matter, Milady?

347
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,630
Let's go see the first sunrise of the year at a beautiful beach.

348
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,990
Just the two of us!

349
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,500
What's the point of going to watch a sunrise?

350
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,260
It's really cold out.

351
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,490
Shut up, you idiot!

352
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,660
Stop talking and get ready!

353
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,220
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

354
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,100
Osechi is Also Good, but Enjoy Hayate, Too.

355
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,100
Osechi = Traditional New Year's food.

356
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,550
Did you know? In Vietnam, they eat
watermelon on New Year's for good luck,

357
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:27,450
and in Hong Kong, they give
New Year's allowances even to adults.
