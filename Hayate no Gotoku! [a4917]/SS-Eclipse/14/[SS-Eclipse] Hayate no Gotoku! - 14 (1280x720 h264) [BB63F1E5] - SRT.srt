1
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:09,280
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,020
Got it?

3
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,670
What? A party to celebrate my acceptance to Hakuou?

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,740
Yeah, isn't it a good idea?

5
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,200
But we haven't received official notice yet.
Isn't it a little hasty to have one?

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,980
Don't worry about it! You definitely passed the exam!

7
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,360
To be honest,

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,260
I have confidence, too.

9
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:47,990
One hindrance...

10
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,000
...after another.

11
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,820
I was toyed with by the proctor,

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,270
and I even had to fight monkeys.

13
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,180
I can't go to school!

14
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,750
Even after all that, I did my best.

15
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,990
Yeah, you're right.

16
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,320
All right, go!

17
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,550
Yes!

18
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,830
Also, I was lucky that all the questions were three-choice multiple choice questions.

19
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,650
I'm really good when it comes to multiple choice.

20
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,620
This one!

21
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:35,740
You idiot!

22
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,050
Why did you have to open that box out of all of them?!

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,420
I'm sorry Milady!

24
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,420
Hey, come back here!

25
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:53,110
I cannot believe you are good at multiple choice questions.

26
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:58,390
If Hayate had realized how unlucky he was,

27
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:04,000
then the coming comedy, I mean tragedy,
might have been avoidable, or not; who knows?

28
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,540
A butler is one who serves.

29
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,300
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

30
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,850
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

31
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,150
Yes.

32
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:26,790
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

33
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,130
In a -40° C environment, you can hit a nail in with a banana.

34
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,380
What are you saying, Onee-chan?

35
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,670
I want pickled cucumber.

36
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,240
HIIIIINAAAAAAA!!!

37
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,730
Hina, I'm in trouble!

38
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,540
I'm in deeeeep trouble!

39
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,090
Haven't I always told you to knock before entering other people's rooms?

40
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,250
I'm sorry... I'm really sorry...

41
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,820
Listen, Onee-chan.

42
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,240
Knocking is the best invention mankind has ever invented.

43
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,620
Next time you forget, I'll seriously hit you.

44
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,640
Seriously?

45
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,090
Ah, Yuki-chan.

46
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,110
You came home?

47
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,560
Yup, I'm home, Mom.

48
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,620
You should have given us a call.

49
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,290
Are you managing, living alone?

50
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,180
Don't worry. Have faith in your daughter.

51
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,350
I haven't spent money at host clubs,

52
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,180
and I haven't been tricked by "It's me" frauds or phishing mails!

53
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,700
But I want to see your room once.

54
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,210
I'm in the middle of an important conversation with Hina!

55
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,200
Anyway, can you bring milk tea and some snacks.

56
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,930
Dash! Now!

57
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:11,690
Okay.

58
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,320
Onee-chan!

59
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,430
Make sure the milk tea is sweet, okay!

60
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,440
Three teaspoons of sugar, got it?!

61
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,370
She always does whatever she wants.

62
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,060
Ah, it's so sweet!

63
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,190
I love dorayaki!

64
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,380
Maybe you'll get along with the cat robot from the future.

65
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,600
Life's great!

66
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,840
So? Didn't you come because you had something you wanted to talk to me about?

67
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,920
That's right!

68
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,220
I'm in trouble, Hina!

69
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,480
Eat or talk. Make a choice.

70
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,530
You see, the Sanzenin butler boy came to take the transfer exam.

71
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,230
Oh, did he really?

72
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,630
Good for Hayate-kun. Hakuou's exam's pretty hard.

73
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:00,020
But with his position of Nagi's butler,
he probably has no other choice but to pass.

74
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,530
He probably put a lot of effort into it.

75
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,660
Maybe.

76
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,430
You can't get in his way, do you hear me?

77
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:05,880
Yikes!

78
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,250
"Yikes"?

79
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,710
Don't tell me you...

80
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,740
N-No! I meant it as a prank!

81
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,590
I meant it as a simple joke!

82
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:18,600
I never thought he'd fail by just one point!

83
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,490
Stop breathing like that!

84
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,230
Your dark side is coming out all over!

85
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,020
What do you think you're doing ruining other people's lives?!

86
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,860
So, your prank is responsible for him failing,

87
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,120
the Superintendent ordered you to report the result, and you've come to me.

88
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,100
Is that right?

89
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,450
Yes, it's exactly as you say.

90
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,750
You're hopeless.

91
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,470
Let's see, the only person I can turn to for things like this is...

92
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,360
Huh? Failed?

93
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,630
Yes. And we're headed your way as we speak to give the report and the apology.

94
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,700
Yes, thank you very much.

95
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,600
I-I'm sorry.

96
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,910
Just so you know, I'm not coming along for you.

97
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,670
It's my duty as Hakuou Academy's Student Council President.

98
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,670
What an amazing sister I have.

99
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,760
When you see Hayate-kun,
make sure you apologize sincerely, do you hear?

100
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,520
Y-Yeah, I'll do my best.

101
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,980
I had an inkling that something like this would happen.

102
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,540
But, what do I do now?

103
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,310
Hey, Hayate!

104
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,390
Listen to me and wear the clothes I picked!

105
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,480
You're the party's guest of honor!

106
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,950
I'll be fine the way I'm dressed now!

107
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,170
What are you talking about!

108
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,340
Get changed already!

109
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:43,180
But the clothes you pick out are things like sailor uniforms and animal ears!

110
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,880
You're wrong. Tonight's this!

111
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,530
Over my dead body!

112
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,580
Why? It's neither of the things you said.

113
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,120
It's no longer possible to tell the truth.

114
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,120
I'll never put it on!

115
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,620
What should I do... What should I do... What should I do...

116
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,850
What should I do... What should I do...

117
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,330
What should I do?! What should I do!?

118
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,570
Why don't you calm down?

119
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,160
Welcome, both of you.

120
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,270
G-Good evening!

121
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,450
Th-This is Oka**ya's An**yaki!

122
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,560
It's still early to give it!

123
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,640
It was hard to decide if I should get
****tasia's Green Turtle Bread instead or not.

124
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,110
I-In any case, please come in.

125
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,700
So, um, where's Hayate-kun?

126
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,370
Well...

127
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,870
M-Maria-san...

128
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,240
What is... going on...

129
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,170
Well...

130
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,410
Klaus-san.

131
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:54,940
Without an event like this, our Lady won't host a social affair.

132
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:00,020
Since we don't have many opportunities, we took the chance to host a big one.

133
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,840
There you have it.

134
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,220
It's all thanks to him getting admitted to Hakuou.

135
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:11,880
He sure is a troublemaker,
but he's finally done something good for our Lady.

136
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,570
Where do you think you're going, Onee-chan?

137
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,230
I have urgent business to take care of...

138
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,630
You're not going anywhere.

139
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,080
He loves me.

140
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,940
He loves me not.

141
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,780
He loves me.

142
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,700
He loves me not.

143
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,570
He loves me.

144
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,220
He loves me not.

145
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,670
He loves me.

146
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,760
He loves me not.

147
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,670
Argh, this is getting annoying!

148
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,290
The language of flowers for corn is trust!

149
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,380
Hayate-kun and I are...

150
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,930
They're dancing.

151
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,300
Yes...

152
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,240
It's almost embarrassing to see how merry they are.

153
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,250
He must be really happy he got accepted.

154
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,810
It must be because of the lecture
I gave him about what the exams are like.

155
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:10,070
Plus I even cornered him in that he'll be fired if he failed!

156
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,830
Oh, is something wrong?

157
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:18,200
N-No, my chronic peritonitis triggered a neuralgia, and it's hurting the sties in my head.

158
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,730
So please don't worry at all.

159
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,810
Damn that Klaus. I originally wanted to have a cosplay party with just the two of us.

160
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,240
Oh please.

161
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,590
If this wasn't your congratulation party, I would have been long gone.

162
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:37,750
But Milady, you look great in that dress.

163
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,890
You're more dazzling than anyone else in this room.

164
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,560
You idiot! You're the guest of honor today!

165
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,600
You flatter me.

166
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,820
But I'm happy. Thank you very much, Milady.

167
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,090
Well, if you're happy, then I guess all is well.

168
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:54,430
Yes.

169
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,980
This situation makes it harder to bring the issue up than I'd thought.

170
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:05,880
So, please continue to watch them be merry for a while more.

171
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,870
Kushiyaki da!

172
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,900
Kushiyaki da! = We'll have meat on a skewer!
Raja-! = Roger!

173
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,650
Raja-!

174
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,820
Japan! Go desu! = Japan! I'm go!
Note: Quote from "Go Hiromi"

175
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,820
Japan! Go desu!

176
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,920
So what do we do now, Onee-chan?

177
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,530
For now, do you want to wait until the party ends?

178
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,600
Yup, I will.

179
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,830
N-No, this is my responsibility.

180
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:40,680
If you can't take care of your own responsibilities, you can't claim to be an adult.

181
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,800
Onee-chan.

182
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,360
A-Ayasaki-kun.

183
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,500
Ah, hello, Katsura-sensei.

184
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,620
Welcome.

185
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,110
Is something wrong?

186
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,360
To... To tell you the truth...

187
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,960
To tell you the truth-

188
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,200
To tell you the truth-

189
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:08,880
The teacher herself has come all the way from Hakuou Academy to celebrate the Acceptance Party of our Lady's butler, Ayasaki Hayate!

190
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,360
Please, give us a speech.

191
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,420
U-Um...

192
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,720
Ah...

193
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,220
Congratulations, Ayasaki-kun.

194
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,310
Here, my congratulations gift.

195
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,160
Thank you very much.

196
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,640
You've worked very hard. I'm really happy for you.

197
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,870
Onee-chan...

198
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,290
Counter... That was a counter hit.

199
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,770
I thought adults had to take responsibility.

200
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,070
But! But!

201
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:54,180
Next, we'll have Lady Nagi's best friend, Saginimiya Isumi-sama, give us a word.

202
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,940
Ah...

203
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:10,900
Isumi-sama was headed this way but got lost and was found at a gift shop by Lake Mashuu, so we'll save this for another time.

204
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:10,900
Note: Lake Mashuu is in Hokkaido.

205
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,650
That's the Isumi I know.

206
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,440
How did she get out of Honshuu?

207
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,410
Next, we have a congratulatory gift from Lady Nagi's cousin, Aizawa Sakuya-sama.

208
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:23,550
Open!

209
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,300
The title is "Fly"!

210
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,780
How is it flying?

211
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,260
The size, perhaps?

212
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:43,530
But isn't it a shame that neither Isumi
nor Sakuya could make it to your party?

213
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,440
It's fine.

214
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,520
I'm happy enough that Katsura-sensei and Hinagiku-san came.

215
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,660
Come to think of it, why are you here, Hinagiku?

216
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,320
Th-Th-Th-That's because...

217
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,250
Can I have a moment?

218
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,660
What?

219
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,540
Just come.

220
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,110
WHAT?!?! He failed?!

221
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,420
You're too loud!

222
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,290
That's impossible coming from Hayate.

223
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,990
It's the truth, so you can't do anything about it.

224
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,830
I want to somehow let him know, but...

225
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,750
That's impossible. I can't tell him now that he didn't pass.

226
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,940
Why are you guys even saying that he passed before he even received notice?

227
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,540
Can't you do something with your authority as the Student Council President?

228
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,390
Then how about Sanzenin family's authority?

229
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,210
The night is starting to come to a close.

230
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,970
So now let's have our last event.

231
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,870
Tonight could not have happened without all of you.

232
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:40,260
Therefore, let's have a word of gratitude from Ayasaki Hayate.

233
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,380
U-Um...

234
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:50,340
Thank you all for your time and coming today to celebrate for the likes of me.

235
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,200
I never imagined I'd be able to go to school again.

236
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,940
It's really like a dream.

237
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,100
I had completely given up on it...

238
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,150
...that I would ever be able to go to high school.

239
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:06,220
The days where you chat
and fool around with your friends in class.

240
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:11,160
A really mundane life, yet a life that seems so far away and a life I miss.

241
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:17,000
I thought I would never gain it no matter how much I wished for it.

242
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,640
However, Lady Nagi made my dream come true.

243
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,850
I'm really a blessed guy.

244
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:29,680
I'm the luckiest butler in the world
to be able to serve such a kind Lady.

245
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,700
Hayate...

246
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,150
Th-Thank you very much.

247
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,080
Ayasaki-kun.

248
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,670
Listen to me, Ayasaki-kun.

249
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,820
Yes, what is it?

250
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:44,890
Onee-chan.

251
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,070
Truth is... I have very disappointing news for you.

252
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,600
Disappointing news?

253
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,230
Yes.

254
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,200
Is... Is she finally going to say it?

255
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,840
The truth is...

256
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,910
I know.

257
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,940
Ehh?!

258
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,540
Hayate-kun?

259
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,510
My homeroom teacher is you, right, Katsura-sensei?

260
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,730
Heh?

261
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:14,250
You're right. With you as my teacher,
I can imagine a really rough school life waiting for me.

262
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:18,930
I have some concerns that I might get physically and mentally worn out,

263
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,260
but please don't worry.

264
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,090
That'll probably be a fun life in its own way.

265
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,870
You're right; it sounds fun.

266
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,500
How much more do you intend to fool around?

267
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,410
Whose fault do you think it is that this happened?

268
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,240
B-But...

269
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,310
With that innocent look on his face, I can't make myself say it.

270
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,070
And it's like, "Why haven't you figured it out yourself by now, asshole."

271
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,230
That's right!

272
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,580
I'm troubled by it so much,
yet he's just smiling with an idiot look.

273
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,990
Suddenly rage is starting to take over!

274
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:50,990
Onee-chan?

275
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,430
I've decided! I'll take the secret that he failed all the way to my grave!

276
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,840
What?

277
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,790
It's a huge school. No one's going to notice one fake student.

278
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,600
I, Katsura Yukiji, fear nothing!

279
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,670
What kind of nonsense are you speaking?

280
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,980
I'm not speaking nonsense!

281
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,450
He's the nonsense!

282
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:13,610
Um, what are you all talking about so exuberantly?

283
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,140
No, it's nothing.

284
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,940
It's nothing important.

285
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,720
We're sorry, Hayata-kun.

286
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,650
Y-You girls!

287
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,160
Why are you all here?

288
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,530
We visited Katsura-chan's room, and we found this.

289
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:36,470
Therefore we came to console Hayata-kun, who we were sure would be sulking.

290
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:39,350
I'm very sorry for you, Hayata-kun.

291
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:44,730
Right now, you might be feeling that your life's over.
There's nothing good from here on out.

292
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,110
But mistakes you make when you're young are valuable for your future!

293
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:52,790
No matter how many times you may tumble over, keep rising up like a weed and Princess **rah!

294
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,670
Cheer up, Hayata-kun.

295
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,820
Fight, ya!

296
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,480
Goodbye, Hayata-kun.

297
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,380
Um...

298
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:12,900
I still don't understand what exactly is going on, but...

299
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,910
Basically, I failed, right?

300
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,500
Yeah...

301
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,190
I...

302
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,270
I see...

303
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:26,820
I'm sorry!

304
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,610
I'm fully responsible!

305
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,490
So boil me or roast me or do whatever you please to me!

306
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:34,600
In fact, just kill me!

307
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,290
Eh?

308
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,460
He's gone.

309
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,470
Hayate-kun?

310
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,260
Hayate!

311
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,500
Where did he go?

312
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:03,390
You'll catch a cold if you stay out too long.

313
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,100
Nagi and Katsura-san are worried.

314
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,670
I've done something horrible to Milady.

315
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,610
To Katsura-sensei and Hinagiku-san, too...

316
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,940
To all the people who celebrated me today, too...

317
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,220
Hayate-kun?

318
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,620
It's because I was so merry and had high hopes.

319
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,010
I'm such an idiot.

320
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:44,470
Before coming here, I learned the lesson to not have hopes for the future so that I wouldn't be hurt.

321
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:53,500
But as I indulged myself in Maria-san's, Milady's, and everyone's kindness, I was forgetting that very basic mindset.

322
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,630
The emptier you are, the less you lose.

323
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,760
So... So...

324
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,610
Would the empty person you describe ever manage to be Nagi's butler?

325
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,420
W-Well...

326
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,780
Of course, I'm aware that I cause a lot of trouble.

327
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,750
But I'm ready to refocus my mind and work harder.

328
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,430
"Work harder"?

329
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,810
Oh, but your face says you can't do it alone.

330
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,130
Maria-san?

331
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,620
Therefore...

332
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,480
...go here and learn everything you can.

333
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,220
Th-This is a Hakuou Academy...

334
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,720
M-My student ID?

335
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,960
Yes. I sent my recommendation,
and with that factored in, they admitted you.

336
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:59,270
Someone who's empty and has nothing to lose can't possibly become her butler.

337
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,790
Maria-san...

338
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:12,220
Hayate-kun. I think one day, there'll be a time when your strength will truly be necessary to protect her.

339
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:17,160
So please become Nagi's best butler.

340
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:24,930
Yes. I will go to Hakuou and become the best butler!

341
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,650
Okay.

342
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,930
All right, I'm going to work hard!

343
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,700
I'm going to become the best butler for Maria-san's sake, too!

344
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,630
Not for me, you know.

345
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:43,780
And, I cannot believe how close I was to Hayate-kun just then.

346
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,920
So that was Maria's embarrassing moment.

347
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,590
You're better off not doing it
if you're going to blush over it later.

348
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:54,240
Next time, we'll fight against the girls' expectations.

349
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,720
Nagi and...

350
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,690
Hayate's...

351
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,430
Butler Network!

352
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,430
Good mor-eve-noon. I'm Sanzenin Nagi.

353
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,460
Hello. I'm Ayasaki Hayate.

354
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,530
I don't really get it, but you can go to school, after all?

355
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:46,440
Yes, thank you very much. I'll study hard so as to not shame you as your butler.

356
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,340
I-I see, so you're making serious considerations about our future.

357
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,750
What's wrong, Milady?

358
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:57,090
Nothing. I was only doing some meditation.

359
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,230
It's about aura power!

360
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,190
Bye bye.

361
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:05,920
I was happy out of my mind that I got accepted,
but will I be fine here with my borderline grades?

362
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,820
You'll do fine, Hayate.

363
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,310
Battles are meant to be fought while reading two, three moves ahead.

364
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:14,130
It's nice to wake up early once in a while.
I met an interesting person.

365
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,290
Do I lose if I comment that you're the most interesting one?

366
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,300
I think so.

367
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,670
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

368
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,930
Samurai, Chivalry, Mobile Vandam.

369
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,440
Himuro, are these enough flowers?

370
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,000
Thank you, Sir Taiga.

371
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,950
It's dangerous, so don't copy what Ayasaki-kun's doing.
