1
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,990
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,050
Milady.

3
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,000
Come on a date with me.

4
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,560
Golden Week makes the school really quiet.

5
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,240
It's great that I got my position as homeroom teacher back, but I've got to make sure to get that salary up.

6
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,810
God, I feel like crap.

7
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,220
I don't feel like correcting tests at all.

8
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,000
I guess a drink would perk me up.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,400
Cheers!

10
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,870
Yup. Hawaii's the best place to be during Golden Week break.

11
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,950
Hey! I'm trying to set the mood, taking one for the team!

12
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:07,740
Calm down.

13
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,260
Nagi's gone to the Aegean Sea.

14
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,350
Why didn't you go with her?

15
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,520
I didn't want to disturb the two of them.

16
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,790
I see.

17
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,650
Gather all the volumes of the work Bro said he wanted to see!

18
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:22,160
Sir!

19
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,100
Wh-What is this about?

20
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,110
Are they here for the Godfather series?

21
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,080
Or perhaps Battle Without Morals?

22
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,600
If it's V Cinema shows, it'll be hard to gather everything.

23
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,800
Do you have all the Brave ***aiser VCR volumes?

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,970
I'm not accepting half.

25
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,590
Oh.

26
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,080
Sure we do.

27
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,040
Then how about Super Human Robot *****der?

28
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,900
Sure we do.

29
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,190
Not bad.

30
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,350
If you want, we have the entire Fight! *****man, too.

31
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,600
I'll come again.

32
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,610
Today's episode takes place on Mykonos Island where Milady is for vacation.

33
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:11,000
Therefore, those of us who stayed to watch
the house won't get any screen time, I guess.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,220
I don't think it's so bad to have a week off.

35
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,880
Strange, did I just hear someone?

36
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,200
Must be my imagination.

37
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,270
"A week off", someone says, but this is the final episode.

38
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,650
WHAT?! SERIOUSLY?!

39
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,390
I think I heard something again.

40
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,580
Wow! So this is the Aegean Sea?!

41
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,040
Milady, come and see this!

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,570
Come to think of it, this is your first time to Mykonos Island, isn't it?

43
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:19,670
Yes. I've been offshore fishing to the cold ocean, so I have been to Iturup Island before.

44
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,640
I'm glad you didn't get arrested.

45
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,560
Milady! The ocean's very beautiful!

46
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,870
So is the Clear Black LCD, so I'm fine.

47
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,450
Since when has Milady been like that?

48
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,680
I'm not sure. She's always been like that.

49
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,530
You can't do anything about some things.

50
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,890
Isn't there anything we can do about it?

51
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,750
So this is Cappadocia!

52
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,330
This indeed is a great view!

53
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,940
So people used to live in those stone homes, huh?

54
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,750
Look, look, Hina-san. That one looks like a camel's hump.

55
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,310
You're right, it really is like a camel's hump.

56
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,520
That is  a camel!

57
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,460
Stop joking around and enjoy the view from a high place a little.

58
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,540
No! I'm fine!

59
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,520
Hina-san?

60
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,500
Besides, you know I don't like high places, Ayumu.

61
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,010
But, for a person who doesn't like heights,
you were able to get on the plane just fine.

62
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:31,010
That's why I forced myself to sleep
starting just before the plane took off!

63
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,280
I will not get up until we land, no matter what happens!

64
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,450
You're right. You didn't eat food at all, either.

65
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,710
Not a single bite in that thirteen-hour flight.

66
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,440
Anyway, I like to see views from lower places!

67
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,620
I guess it can't be helped.

68
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,370
You don't seem to be very energetic despite the fact that we're here for a vacation.

69
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,830
There isn't a reason for me to be energetic.

70
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,210
Then let's go outside.

71
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,780
If you're under the great blue sky, you're bound to get energetic.

72
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,180
It's hot out.

73
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,330
Then you're going to stay in the entire time?

74
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,150
Yeah.

75
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,400
I see...

76
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,460
Don't worry. Let's go shopping later, then.

77
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,100
But... But... Milady is...

78
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,900
There's nothing I can do about that.

79
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,460
It's fine. I'll spend my time inside, too.

80
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,350
What should we do now...

81
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,130
Fine! I got it!

82
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,190
I'll go out tomorrow!

83
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,640
Y-You will?!

84
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,500
Yeah. But just for a while, okay?

85
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,790
Just for a while.

86
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,220
Yes!

87
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,850
Sorry for all the trouble regarding her.

88
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,880
It's fine.

89
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,620
It's already been a month since the new school year started.

90
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,780
Please keep watching over Nagi.

91
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,710
Yes.

92
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,330
Milady is starting to adjust to the new classes well, too.

93
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,350
Is she?

94
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,810
I hope she will go to school properly this year.

95
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,660
Y-Yes, I do, too.

96
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,040
Yay! My patent for UFO engineering technology sold!

97
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,170
We're back.

98
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,520
We're back...

99
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,560
Welcome back!

100
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,160
How was Cappadocia?

101
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,040
The eyebrows were long, the nose was split in two, and I got spat on all over.

102
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,150
That was the real camel!

103
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,250
So tomorrow, we go to Greece, eh?

104
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,990
I'm looking forward to seeing the Parthenon.

105
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,010
It's a flat structure.

106
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,820
But it stands at the top of the hill on the Acropolis.

107
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,270
We go to the Mykonos Island after that.

108
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,590
Right. Hayata-kun's there, isn't he?

109
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:07,200
Yay! So this is Athens!

110
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,460
It's amazing!

111
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,220
You can see the entire city from the Parthenon!

112
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,880
This view! It certainly is a World Heritage site!

113
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,770
But...

114
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,060
Hina-san! Why are you only staring at the Parthenon?

115
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,740
The Parthenon is the World Heritage site! The view doesn't matter!

116
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,780
There you go saying things like that.

117
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,790
It's a waste if you don't see this.

118
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,480
No! I don't need to!

119
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,290
Hina-san...

120
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,740
I don't need to see views from high places.

121
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,450
Besides, where did those three go?

122
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,960
If you want to tour around, take those three with you.

123
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,000
They all said they'd seen this enough times when they were in kindergarten.

124
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,800
Those damn bourgeois girls...

125
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,810
Also, they played all night long, so they wanted to sleep until the time to catch the ship to Mykonos Island came.

126
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,800
But you were playing all night long, too.

127
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,460
So how are you so full of energy?

128
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,970
It's because this is my first trip with you.

129
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,690
This trip is meant for us to become closer friends, right?

130
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,580
I wonder why...

131
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,930
I end up at high places with you so often.

132
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,550
Hayate-kun? You mean you also...

133
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,190
What's the matter?

134
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,300
So? Where can I get the best view from?

135
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,580
Eh, ummm... The view from here.

136
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,900
D-Don't let go of my hands, okay?!

137
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,960
I won't.

138
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:48,270
Wow, this is like some magical land, isn't it, Milady?

139
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,740
Yeah, in a way, seeing how nothing has changed since long ago, it's like a city where time has stopped.

140
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,210
So you've been here before?

141
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,230
In fact, I used to live here.

142
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,140
Both Maria and I have lived in Japan
for less time than other places combined.

143
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,110
No matter where she went, she would always lock herself up.

144
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,800
Shut up.

145
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,280
But really, rather than always confining yourself indoors, you should start going outside and play.

146
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,430
Is something wrong?

147
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:24,000
Nothing. I just remembered that there was a guy who said the exact same thing in the past.

148
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,330
I don't remember his face, but he was a thief, a liar, and a guy who couldn't keep promises.

149
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,500
My hat...

150
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,180
Leave it to me, Milady.

151
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,270
Here, Milady.

152
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,190
I got your hat back.

153
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,350
Mi...lady?

154
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,840
Um...

155
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,160
Have you shrunk, Milady?

156
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,630
What are you saying to a person you've just met for the first time?!

157
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,690
I am growing steadily every day!

158
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:46,520
I-I'm sorry. I mistook you for someone else.

159
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,620
Gosh, you... Give this back to me.

160
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,090
This is my hat.

161
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,560
Y-You can't.

162
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,690
That's Lady Nagi's hat.

163
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,290
So it is mine.

164
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,570
Like I said, this is my, Sanzenin Nagi's, hat, right?

165
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,510
What?! This tiny girl is Lady Nagi?

166
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,010
Don't call me tiny!

167
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,660
What? This can't be. Even if this is an "anything goes" kind of anime...

168
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,480
It can't be!

169
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,490
I jumped into a time slip?!

170
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,820
No, I won't accept this happening.

171
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,660
It can't possibly happen!

172
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,720
E-Excuse me!

173
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,800
What day of the month of the year is today?

174
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,530
Peperoncino?

175
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,470
Naporitana spaghettina carbonara.

176
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,860
Gah! He's a foreigner, so I can't communicate.

177
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,060
See you, commoner. I'm in a hurry.

178
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,140
Don't cause trouble to others.

179
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,020
Wait! Please wait!

180
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,760
What are you doing?! Are you a kidnapper, too?

181
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,420
N-No! I'm not a kidnapper.

182
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,320
Honestly! Let go of me.

183
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,090
Seriously. Because there are people like you...

184
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,560
Anyway... Anyway, the question is why I came to the past.

185
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,010
If I can figure that out...

186
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,300
This is why I don't like going outside.

187
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,600
Milady!

188
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,740
P-Please wait! Please wait a moment, Milady.

189
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,770
Let's change the way of thinking.

190
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,350
If this is the past, and she is the Milady when she was little...

191
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,450
This is...

192
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,940
This is the chance to cure her super-indoor lifestyle.

193
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,390
Then she might be able to become a girl who can be touched by the blue ocean and sky.

194
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,050
Hey, commoner. Why are you smiling?

195
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,890
I'll do this! It will work!

196
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:40,500
I can do it. I will change Milady with my power!

197
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,740
So, like I was saying, Milady...

198
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,670
Come on a date with me.

199
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,950
Huh?

200
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:55,640
A first-class lady has to be someone who steps out under the sun.

201
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,430
So will you hang out with me for a while?

202
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,250
W-Well, I guess I can.

203
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:04,960
Will you be fine?

204
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,670
Fine about what?

205
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,430
How should I say...

206
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,550
Right now, I'm being targeted by the mafia, who're trying to kidnap me.

207
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,490
Why are you seriously being chased by the Sicilian Mafia?!

208
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,700
Don't ask me. I don't want them to, either.

209
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,390
Barbeque! Pancake! Soft serve ice cream!

210
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,630
Italiano taneuma.

211
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,830
Seriously...

212
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,240
This is why I don't like to go outside!

213
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,930
I see.

214
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,950
It's because she's gone through things like this as a child...

215
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,800
...that she confines herself in rooms.

216
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,730
I know! Milady, let's go stargazing on the beach!

217
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,700
Idiot.

218
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,940
I always get in trouble like this. I don't want to go outside.

219
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:29,410
Don't worry. Past or future, I will protect you.

220
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,380
So, let's go.

221
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,850
Come see the stars with me.

222
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,820
Okay! Then it's a promise!

223
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,520
It'll be all right.

224
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,990
How about we get rid of them before we go see the stars?

225
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,610
Get rid of them? But how?

226
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,940
Please don't worry.

227
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,710
Here, call the police.

228
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,280
You acted gallant and all, but you actually rely on others, eh?

229
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,280
Today, the pacific saury is cheap!

230
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,420
Milady!

231
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:33,980
Ish ribidish.

232
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,110
Komattarube.

233
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,790
It'll be fine!

234
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,750
I will protect you!

235
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,600
Erika-sama!

236
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,410
Ebi-chan!

237
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,610
Yunsona!

238
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,220
You're pretty good.

239
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:18,520
I trust you!

240
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,510
Milady...

241
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,160
Yes!

242
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:24,990
Kyaba-kura.

243
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,650
I'm borrowing this.

244
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,500
Nabeshin! Nabeshin!

245
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,420
Goddamn.

246
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,690
It's all over, Milady.

247
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,770
I'm sorry. I ended up making holes in your hat.

248
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,370
It's fine. It's proof that you protected me.

249
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,110
If you hadn't protected me, I could have died here.

250
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,550
Wait. Could the reason I was summoned to the past be...

251
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,360
Now, as we promised, let's watch the stars here, shall we?

252
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,930
My hat...

253
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,490
Liar...

254
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,390
Hayate!

255
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,250
Milady?

256
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,380
Where did you go off to?

257
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,820
Both Maria and I have been worrying all this time.

258
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,970
You, too. What are you doing here?

259
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,750
Well, um...

260
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,770
It doesn't concern you.

261
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,560
I was just writing a message to the idiot who lied to me.

262
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,670
The time difference between Japan and Mykonos Island is -7 hours.

263
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:26,900
They must be looking up at the beautiful starry sky above the Aegean Sea.

264
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,270
Yet, we're here stuck watching the house.

265
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,660
You'll comfort me, won't you, Tama?

266
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,100
It is true that because of this, we are capable of spending some alone time.

267
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,240
It's the first time we've looked up at the sky together, isn't it?

268
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,220
Not like I want to look up at the foggy Nerima sky.

269
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,080
I see, I see. So you're lonely, too.

270
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,690
There, good boy. There, good boy.

271
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,390
They are my life...

272
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,900
What, you're still awake?

273
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:05,620
Yes. I was wondering if Hayate-san is looking up at these stars over at Mykonos Island or not.

274
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,650
I'm sure, but I bet the sky over there is filled with many more stars than this.

275
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,640
Yes.

276
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,870
That's the Torus Shepherd.

277
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,010
Next to it is the Big Dipper.

278
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,440
Beyond that is...

279
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,830
Hey, there's a leak over there.

280
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:22,480
Keh. I'll show you the stars over the Aegean Sea one of these days.

281
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,720
Yes. I'll look forward to it.

282
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,320
What were you thinking, Hina-san?

283
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,190
I was wondering if Nagi and everyone else were looking at these stars too or not.

284
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,110
I was, too!

285
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:43,510
Nagi... She said she was going to look for Hayate-kun and...

286
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,980
The stars are very beautiful, aren't they, Milady?

287
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,860
It's not bad to see the stars outside once in a while.

288
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,300
Thank you for protecting me.

289
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,180
Um...

290
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,770
I'm counting on you in the future, too!

291
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,750
Yes! It'll be my pleasure!
