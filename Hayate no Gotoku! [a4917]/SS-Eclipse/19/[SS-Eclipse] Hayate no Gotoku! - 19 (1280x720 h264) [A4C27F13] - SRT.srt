1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:09,400
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:09,950
Got it?

3
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,870
Screen Text: "While walking outside, harm befalls the local residences"

4
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,880
Screen Text: Sada

5
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,890
What movie is this, Milady?

6
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,290
It is very avant-garde.

7
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,580
When I rented a video from Wataru,
this looked interesting, so I borrowed it, too.

8
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,730
Apparently I'll die if I don't show it to two other people within one week.

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,090
What? Isn't that the same curse as that circular movie?

10
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,870
Such an unscientific thing can't possibly exist.

11
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,920
You have a childish side to you, don't you?

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,200
Oh, right.

13
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,930
Allow me to explain just in case.

14
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,560
The circular movie is the famous Ri-

15
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,950
No! Don't say any more than that.

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,460
A butler is one who serves.

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,960
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

18
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:27,960
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

19
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,240
Yes.

20
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:38,030
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

21
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,600
Although it's the Obon festival now,
the season for ghost stories, did I react too much?

22
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,110
Because it's Obon, no one's watching.

23
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,550
From here on, we're working the cel artists into the ground.

24
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,170
Damn Nagi... She's past the return date again.

25
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,910
I understand that O****'s works
require more than one viewing to understand...

26
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,820
Hey, that circular movie's gone.

27
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,930
Someone actually rented that fake copy?

28
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,800
Saki, Nagi's overdue with the rental, so give her a call, will you?

29
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,110
What's with her?

30
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,080
It's been a week since, but nothing has happened.

31
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,230
It's as I told you.

32
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,350
Spirits do not exist in this world.

33
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,160
You're right.

34
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,060
Maria-san's amazing.

35
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,800
She looks so mature;
I bet she doesn't have anything she's bad at.

36
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,340
Oh, I just remembered we have watermelon.

37
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,330
Would you like to enjoy some?

38
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,460
Then let's give it to Milady, too.

39
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,770
Actually, I already took some to Nagi, but...

40
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,420
No, this won't cut it!

41
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,450
Isn't there a more striking name?

42
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,080
I'm going to find a new genre with horror imbedded.

43
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,520
I see. When it comes to manga,
she gets engrossed in it too much.

44
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,460
Although that's what's good about her.

45
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,080
Give one to me, too.

46
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,430
Wataru-kun, what are you doing here?

47
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:52,100
Well you know, Nagi's been overdue with her rental again, so I'm here to bug her.

48
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,390
Right, what was that strange movie?

49
00:04:55,390 --> 00:05:00,470
I noticed it was missing from the shelf, so it was Nagi who took it.

50
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:04,120
It's a fake version made when the authentic one was popular.

51
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,870
I didn't think someone who would want to watch that crap existed.

52
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,160
I mean, Sa**ko doesn't even come out.

53
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,550
If I remember correctly, something like this comes out when you watch that movie.

54
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,430
Yes, if something like that existed, it would be gross, but...

55
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,720
Don't you agree, Maria-san?

56
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,140
Huh? Is something wrong?

57
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,700
Saki's been acting strangely recently.

58
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,650
Looks like she's worried about something, but won't talk to me about it.

59
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,690
Seriously, just because she's twenty now, does she want to say a thirteen year old isn't reliable enough for her?

60
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,030
Saki-san is going to
her Coming-of-Age Ceremony next year, huh?

61
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,490
Coming-of-Age Ceremony?

62
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,700
Oh, so you'll be twenty when June comes?

63
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,580
Yes.

64
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,810
I should get you something to celebrate, then.

65
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:01,940
What do you want?

66
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,780
That kindness is enough for me.

67
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,670
You always wear that maid outfit so...

68
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,050
What me to buy you a furisode?

69
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,050
Furisode: An elegant kimono for unwed women.

70
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,590
Do you mean that, Sir?

71
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,320
When you become twenty, you'll need one for your Coming-of-Age Ceremony, too, right?

72
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,360
What? You don't need one?

73
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,520
No, I didn't mean that.

74
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,330
Then I'll look forward to it without too much expectation.

75
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:33,140
Could she be upset because I forgot about her birthday and didn't give her the furisode I promised her?

76
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,840
Hey, are birthdays and Coming-of-Age Ceremonies important?

77
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,730
Well, I think so.

78
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,750
By the way, what was your Coming-of-Age Ceremony like, Maria-san?

79
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,430
Huh?

80
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,360
Eh?

81
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:50,320
Right. Maira-san's only seventeen, so she hasn't had hers yet.

82
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,160
Yes, I am still a fresh seventeen year old.

83
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,590
And yet, Hayate-kun...

84
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,630
What made you think I have had my Coming-of-Age ceremony?

85
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,340
M-Maria-san, you're acting strangely.

86
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,500
I'm not acting strange.

87
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,810
Excuse me, I just remembered something I need to do.

88
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,960
Really, what's wrong with Maria-san?

89
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,730
Coming-of-Age Ceremony...

90
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,810
I guess I'll ask Saki personally.

91
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,930
Hey, Saki.

92
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:33,800
Could the reason why you've been sighing be because I forgot about your birthday present?

93
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,240
Come to think of it, nobody celebrated my birthday.

94
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,710
I don't mind though, really.

95
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:50,210
I can't do anything about the time that's passed, but I think the lost trust can be rebuilt!

96
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,660
So what do you need from me?

97
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,790
I want to give you a present!

98
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,350
Don't need one.

99
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,730
Who'd ever give you a present!

100
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:05,130
When you ask others for a favor,
"watch what you say," says Haman****.

101
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:05,860
Yes, Sir...

102
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:12,270
Really, it's better for her to play with
her friends than draw manga all day.

103
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,480
Let me go make some tea for the two.

104
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,010
So, what's this present thing about?

105
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:23,450
Well, you see, I want to give a furisode to a certain person,
but I don't have a clue what's good.

106
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,830
Hmm, a furisode as a gift, eh?

107
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,720
I see, so you've finally...

108
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,490
Go to this store.

109
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,190
It's pretty cheap, and you can find variety of furisode your girl would like.

110
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,940
R-Really?

111
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,390
Thanks a bunch, Nagi.

112
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,200
I'll go right away!

113
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,770
But don't buy something too cheap!

114
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,660
Let me ask just in case, but how much does an average furisode cost?

115
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,200
Don't worry, it's cheaper than buying two Fe***ris.

116
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,410
How could clothes be more expensive than a Fe***ri?

117
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,300
Don't make fun of a commoner's sense of money!

118
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,980
Stop shouting.

119
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,650
The chair I hit you with cost more.

120
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,990
What kind of furniture do you have?

121
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,520
Besides, if a man decides to give a present to a woman,

122
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,020
it's natural to pay that much!

123
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,110
You're worthless if you can't!

124
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,860
Y-You may have a point, but...

125
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,570
Where do I find such money?

126
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,240
Although it's not carved in stone, we are engaged.

127
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,820
So no interest and pay me back when you make the money.

128
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,650
Now, it's up to you.

129
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,570
So bright!

130
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,730
Holy Onmyouji!

131
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,490
What's going on here, Maria-san?

132
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,810
Something is  wrong with you.

133
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,630
H-How so?

134
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,440
N-Nothing is wrong.

135
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,450
Th-This is...

136
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,330
What's going on?

137
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,570
No!

138
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,160
Please! Nothing but that!

139
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,920
I cannot handle that black rustling creature!

140
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,150
I didn't know Maria-san had this side to her.

141
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,000
I am sorry; I lost control of myself.

142
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,160
But I just cannot stand them.

143
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,940
Don't worry.

144
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,070
Even if it does appear, I will protect you, Maria-san.

145
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,040
R-Really? You really will?

146
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,270
Yes.

147
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,250
Roach...

148
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,760
What?

149
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,330
N-No way!

150
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,040
H-Hayate-kun... What was that?

151
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,690
Please don't worry, Maria-san.

152
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,100
Roach!

153
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,180
Roach?

154
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,940
Cock Roach Roach Roach Roach.

155
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,640
Ima aini yukimasu.

156
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,640
Ima aini yukimasu. = We'll come see you soon.

157
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,950
Su... Suusuu surun desu.

158
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,950
Su... Suusuu surun desu. = I... I feel a chill down my spine.

159
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:22,050
I didn't know Sir was worried about my birthday.

160
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,600
Compared to that, Grandma won't even call me.

161
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,040
Allow me to explain for a moment.

162
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,160
Kijima Saki's grandmother is the legendary housemaid,

163
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,180
Kijima Rei.

164
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,760
In order to find her missing daughter and son-in-law,

165
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,820
Saki's parents,

166
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,350
at times, she wandered around the world with Saki.

167
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,550
At times, she protected the president from assassination.

168
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,190
At times, she closed cases that would have been filed away forever.

169
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:03,680
And at times, she liberated oppressed citizens by serving delicious cuisine to emperors.

170
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,170
However, the legendary maid is already sixty-two years old.

171
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,860
Her life was about to end in the middle of the Sahara Desert.

172
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,020
Grandma! Grandma!

173
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,300
Do you plan to die here?!

174
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,980
Are you the legendary housemaid, Kijima Rei?!

175
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:25,760
This man is the President of
the Tachibana Group, Tachibana Enkyou.

176
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:31,130
Kijima Rei and Saki were saved by Enkyou.

177
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:35,640
A resonance between hearts that's neither friendship nor love blooms between Enkyou and Rei.

178
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,000
In order to repay the debt, Rei fights against evil and criminals.

179
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,840
And, a fated encounter came to Saki, as well.

180
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,480
Her encounter with Wataru.

181
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,120
His too-young-to-be-a-mother mother didn't give much attention to him.

182
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,020
Saki swore to his lonely face...

183
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:00,390
...that she shall repay the gratitude of saving
Kijima Rei back by raising him to be a wonderful man.

184
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,000
Have some tea.

185
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:10,780
To Saki, it felt like two souls forsaken by mothers were calling to each other.

186
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,540
I serve tea better than you do.

187
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,980
But Wataru was very skilled and could do everything himself.

188
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,940
He was so much more thorough than Saki.

189
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,920
Could I possibly guide him to become a wonderful man?

190
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,710
For your reference, Saki's parents still live in Ueno.

191
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,000
They are not lost, so don't worry about it.

192
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,570
It's a dead end!

193
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,710
Please hold on tight.

194
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,990
Hayate-kun...

195
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,230
What a nice day.

196
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,470
On days like this, it's best to walk around creating the original language of flowers.

197
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,870
Target spotted!

198
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,620
Jet St***m Attack!

199
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,680
Attack!

200
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,780
Attack!

201
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,450
Attack!

202
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,870
It's getting away!

203
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,780
Another round of Jet St***m Attack!

204
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,360
Roger.

205
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,370
Jet St***m!

206
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,400
Attack!

207
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,710
How dare you step on me!

208
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,270
We should be fine, since we've come this far.

209
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,090
On what basis?

210
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,600
Hayate-kun.

211
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,420
That was nothing.

212
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,890
No, that!

213
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,940
Damn you're persistent.

214
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,560
I'll protect Maria-san.

215
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,840
Butler Kick!

216
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,320
I will not forgive you if you touch Hayate-kun.

217
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,920
Ow...

218
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,130
Maria-san.

219
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,030
Hayate-kun.

220
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,010
Are you all right?

221
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:09,150
I talked big saying I'd protect you, but I got protected instead.

222
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,930
That is not true.

223
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,120
You did protect me.

224
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,860
Maria-san.

225
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,560
Oh no, what if that thing attacks Nagi?

226
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,430
Milady's in danger!

227
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:33,710
I was surprised I did not get lost for once, but it seems as though we have a guest.

228
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,150
Isumi-san, you were here?

229
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:54,330
Did you see the black rustling creature here?

230
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,560
That child already left.

231
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,370
She exterminated it?

232
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,130
What's the ruckus here?

233
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,000
Hey.

234
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,840
So you've come.

235
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,810
Did Wataru give you a call?

236
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,830
He didn't?

237
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,280
He must be embarrassed inside.

238
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,200
When you buy a present, you have to use your own money.

239
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,360
When I bought something with my savings, I could afford only a yukata.

240
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,160
My, what a cute yukata.

241
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,110
I-I-Isumi!

242
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,540
Sorry. But why are you here?

243
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:46,450
Nagi said there's something important you need to tell me and that you had a present waiting,

244
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,720
so I should go to your house right away.

245
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,020
Could the present be...

246
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:53,810
...that?

247
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,550
No, this is...

248
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,820
Then what's the important thing you need to tell me?

249
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,890
That Nagi, doing the extra unneeded favor...

250
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,160
But this is an unexpected opportunity.

251
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,470
I'll give this yukata to Isumi and tell her my feelings.

252
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,500
My feelings...

253
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,970
Isumi!

254
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,340
Yes?

255
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:21,780
I got ahold of an extra DVD box of Cha***ion, so I'll give you one.

256
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,230
Oh my.

257
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,520
So what's the important thing you need to tell me?

258
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,350
It's about the acting by Hagino-san, the main character.

259
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,220
Unlike Ryu** Asakura, his acting is cheerful and worth a watch.

260
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,480
Have a good watch when you go home.

261
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,430
Yes, thank you, Wataru-kun.

262
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,280
Sir?

263
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,610
What are you doing out here?

264
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,980
Yeah, well...

265
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,820
Hey, what's this?

266
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:04,110
Um, I felt bad for forgetting about it, so...

267
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,830
I can smell the scent of a female that's not mine.

268
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,590
Huh?

269
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,910
You didn't possibly bring a girl in while I was away and...

270
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,410
...do anything naughty...

271
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,000
No!

272
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,970
It's a present for you! This yukata!

273
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,840
Eh? Why?

274
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:30,120
Well, since I didn't have enough money, I couldn't buy a furisode,

275
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,170
and I had forgotten to get you a present for your birthday.

276
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,560
And I thought that's why you were down recently.

277
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,700
I was wondering what color I should get for my new cell phone.

278
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,030
Huh?!

279
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,110
Oh well.

280
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:11,140
Good grief. It wasn't a present for Isumi.

281
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,820
I see.

282
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,250
And did you lend him the money, after all?

283
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:21,370
No, he said it's pointless unless he buys it with his own money, so he bought a cheaper yukata instead of a furisode.

284
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,550
One that's about fifty thousand yen.

285
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,600
Fifty thousand?

286
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,940
That's not cheap at all.

287
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,970
By the way, that circular creature didn't appear.

288
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:31,110
See, it's all made up.

289
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,680
You're right.

290
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,930
Yes.

291
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,940
What was that?

292
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,020
Did a missile come flying from somewhere?

293
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,040
It's a fireworks show nearby.

294
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,330
Fireworks, eh?

295
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,230
Can't miss these in summer.

296
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,330
All right, let's go out, Hayate.

297
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,160
Yes, Milady.

298
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,600
The grilled squid is the best thing in the summer.

299
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:14,220
You look great in that yukata.

300
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,620
Thank you very much, Sir.

301
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:22,430
Maybe a new misunderstanding has arisen.

302
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,160
Come on, hurry.

303
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,020
It's beautiful, Hayate.

304
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,830
Yes.

305
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,750
Roach.

306
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:52,910
Next week, the dragon and the hamster go head-to-head for their loved one with their pride at stake.

307
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,410
Nagi and...

308
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,470
Hayate's...

309
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,270
Butler Network!

310
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,300
I'm the Red Cross Killer, Sanzein Nagi.

311
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,060
I'm Ayasaki Hayate.

312
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,330
It's really getting hot these days.

313
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,300
Today's temperature at noon was over 30 degrees Celsius.

314
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,310
Please don't make things up.

315
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,400
We don't know if the broadcast date will be really hot or not.

316
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,510
The broadcast date differs depending on area, too.

317
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:53,840
Rather than that, what I want to say is
on a hot day like this, the best thing to do is sit...

318
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,130
...in a chilled room playing MMOs while listening to my character song.

319
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,250
You can't spend such an unhealthy summer vacation.

320
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,920
Bye bye.

321
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,640
All right, summer vacation starts today!

322
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,130
I'll play MMOs and watch anime and draw manga and fool around to my heart's content!

323
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,480
I think you do those even on school days.

324
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,420
Even though the summer break's started,
I don't feel cheerful at all.

325
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,930
I wonder what Hayate-kun's doing now.

326
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,420
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

327
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,890
I Like Books, but Sing It, Great Submarine Castle.

328
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:23,520
Hey, you're the burglar hamster from sometime ago.

329
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,940
Who are you calling a burglar hamster?

330
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,450
The sign of the guardian guides me.
