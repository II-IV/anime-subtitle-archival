1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,220
When watching TV,

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,700
make sure the room is well lit,

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,940
and watch from a distance.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,020
Got it?

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,170
Do people definitely marry after marriage meetings?

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,210
What is this out of the blue?

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,300
Well, um... You see...

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,250
Saki went out for drinks with her friends two nights ago.

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,580
And since it was late, she stayed at her parents' house.

10
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:35,410
Then, she came home yesterday morning and...

11
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,450
Oh, you're back already?

12
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,090
Since you went all the way home, you could have enjoyed the stay.

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,490
No, I didn't want to make you worry, so I came back early.

14
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,990
I said I wasn't worried.

15
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,800
By the way, at last night's party, there were men, too.

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,470
Why should I care?

17
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,270
My mother suggested I have a marriage meeting.

18
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,580
That's great.

19
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,400
Oh, Mom? Get the arrangements moving at once.

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,060
Yes, by any means.

21
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:21,680
What? Saki!

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,360
Okay.

23
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,210
Therefore, tomorrow, Sunday, I will be having the meeting.

24
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,600
So I will be asking for a day off.

25
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,800
Is that fine?

26
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,760
And she went out this morning.

27
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,380
That's a surprising turn of events, but she's having the meeting because she has a desire to get married, right?

28
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,920
I see lots of very selfish disapproval on your face.

29
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,240
Fine, I'll listen to you.

30
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,750
So, a marriage meeting, eh?

31
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,990
Bunch of places to jab.

32
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,680
I have yet to see a marriage meeting with my own eyes.

33
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,510
Then how about we all go on a marriage meeting tour?

34
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,340
Yes! That's a great idea!

35
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,530
One who masters being a butler becomes the master of the world.

36
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:17,900
The Butler War that shakes the planet started!

37
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,020
I don't care about that!

38
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,020
It's no time for that!

39
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,020
Saki might disappear, you know?

40
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,480
They must be at the site by now.

41
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,630
A marriage meeting now-a-days has a classic feeling and is nice.

42
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,780
Let us leave the area to the young people.

43
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,150
Yeah.

44
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,470
No~

45
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,440
Please forgive me, my lord.

46
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,910
What's the problem? What's the problem?

47
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,380
Someone help meee!

48
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,140
What could I be thinking?

49
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,480
That's not what goes on at a marriage meeting.

50
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,590
Marriage meeting?

51
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,990
What the heck is that?

52
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,050
This is one of the super-expensive Japanese restaurants in Tokyo.

53
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,070
Just so you know, it's not Isumi's house's cels being recycled.

54
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,290
To think that Saki and some unknown man are having a marriage meeting here...

55
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,680
I figured it out!

56
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,150
They are following standard practice and are now in the "young people only" phase.

57
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,850
What the heck is that?

58
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,550
Basically the two take a stroll in the garden
and blab about each other's hobbies and stuff.

59
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,190
So it's like a husband and wife comedy show.

60
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,660
J... Just the two of them, alone?

61
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,730
However, this garden is so large,
it's called the Forest of Ambivalence,

62
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,540
and a woman who came for a marriage meeting is currently lost in it.

63
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,650
What?!

64
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,400
Maybe they've turned into bones by now.

65
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,100
We'll find her no matter what!

66
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,070
They won't turn into bones that fast.

67
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:32,080
No, it's more fun to have high tension like this.

68
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,530
So juicy~

69
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,720
N-Nice to meet you!

70
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,570
My name is Kaoru Kyounosuke.
I'm a teacher at Hakuou Academy.

71
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,040
My name is Kijima Saki.

72
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,460
Allow me to explain.

73
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:12,160
Kaoru Kyounosuke has been appearing as a sub-character, but his lines total count is practically nil.

74
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,570
He'll be talking like a machine gun now.

75
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,620
I'm sorry I had you come to a place like this.

76
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,620
No, likewise.

77
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,570
Um, so what are your hobbies?

78
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:30,110
What am I doing? I don't have any intention of marrying, but I just came here in the heat of the moment.

79
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,620
I have lots of Princess ********!

80
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,630
About 300 ******. It's not enough to brag about.

81
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,470
I'm being so rude to him.

82
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,470
Although it's ****, it's only the ***** model.

83
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:38,180
It's Elm***, the phantom of sol***n that was feared in the federal state by the name "Cone Hat".

84
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,280
However in the original Gun*** kit,
it was packaged as Elme** like in the show.

85
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,000
I remember, I was young in those days.

86
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,760
Let me take that back.

87
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,420
But I guess I'll have to explain why all of this is happening.

88
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,290
Cheers!

89
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,360
So, how's it been going lately, Saki?

90
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,600
Yeah, how's it been?

91
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,980
"How"? That's what I want to ask.

92
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,370
Both of you, what happened about getting jobs?

93
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,370
Are you going to say that being a NEET is a crime?

94
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,350
We're on a search to discover who we really are!

95
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,460
I-I'm sorry. I won't ask again.

96
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,590
We don't care about that.

97
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:21,220
When girls get together and ask "how's it been going lately", it's got to be about men.

98
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,710
What, I don't need a boyfriend.

99
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,490
Besides, the job keeps me busy, and I don't have time for that.

100
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,790
You'd only hear that from a person with a life.

101
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,600
You won't get any attention from good men if you're like that.

102
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,670
No need for your concern.

103
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,000
I am already in a good man's hands.

104
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,080
What? What? What does that mean?

105
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,280
So you do have a boyfriend after all?

106
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,490
No, ah...

107
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,730
Give us the details!

108
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,580
So... ah...

109
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,900
Rats, I didn't expect it to be this late.

110
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,660
There are no trains going to Nakano Sakaue at this hour.

111
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,490
I guess I'll call Sir so he won't worry about me
and then stay at my parents' house.

112
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,860
Oh, so you won't be back?

113
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,520
Huh? You sound happy.

114
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,710
Do I?

115
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,570
I'm not thinking things like
"I won't get yelled even if stay up late".

116
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,910
In any case, sorry I made you worry.

117
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,060
Huh? I wasn't worried about you.

118
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,320
But for a girl to return home
in the early morning after drinks is-

119
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,260
I think I can have a peaceful sleep tonight.

120
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,730
Thank you for the food.

121
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,800
Saki-chan, do you always eat meals with a grumpy face like that?

122
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,630
I was born with this face.

123
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,130
How could you say that?

124
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:47,370
How could he not worry about me when I'm returning home in the early morning after drinks?

125
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,940
Because nothing happens, as you see.

126
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,900
I'll go back now.

127
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,450
Hold on, Saki-chan.

128
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,450
What?

129
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,480
Um, Saki-chan, are you interested in a marriage meeting at all?

130
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,920
In addition!

131
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,800
Figures do not come with this kit.

132
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,840
But, it includes ********'s ********.

133
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,800
If you hear "marriage meeting" at that time, anyone would...

134
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,690
And the scale is 1/550.

135
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,150
Um, was my G****m trivia boring?

136
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,360
I-I'm sorry, I was thinking about something.

137
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,270
I can tell from your sad face.

138
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,860
Um...

139
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,010
I'm already twenty-eight,
so my parents are bugging me all the time.

140
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:33,450
They keep telling me to get married,
so I'm here for this marriage meeting without a choice.

141
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,730
It's the same for me!

142
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,100
Should I say by force, or by impulse...

143
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,490
I'm sorry!

144
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,390
It goes for both of us.

145
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,000
Rather than that...

146
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,660
Where... are we?

147
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,700
Where are we?!

148
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,960
Where could they be?

149
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,580
Beasts really could be living here.

150
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:04,250
Rest assured! I will protect you with my body!

151
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,190
Which way do I go!

152
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,360
But Wataru, what happened to Isumi?

153
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,970
Oh.

154
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,870
Why are you bringing Isumi up?

155
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,940
Yeah, if you follow the standard relationship plot,

156
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,930
when you waste time unable to confess love to your significant other,

157
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:29,230
marriage meetings tends to pop up for your partner.

158
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,590
It's nothing like that!

159
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,190
Then leave Saki-san alone.

160
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,280
She's at a good age; she has a right to become happy.

161
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,030
Y-Yeah, but...

162
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,490
You still don't get it?

163
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:45,910
Not that I really care, but in the first place,
it's strange for me, your fiancée, to be listening to you.

164
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,960
Then fine! I won't ask anymore!

165
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,060
I found Saki-san!

166
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,930
What?

167
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,220
Where are we?

168
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,260
I don't know.

169
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,270
Let's find our way back.

170
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,320
Who is he? He looks familiar.

171
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,330
That's Kaoru-sensei.

172
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,410
Oh, that Ga*-Pura geek.

173
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,640
I can't hear what they're saying,
but it looks like they're in a good mood.

174
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,420
Yes.

175
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:15,070
Damn, Saki. Is she serious about him?

176
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,560
But, can't we somehow hear what they're saying?

177
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,430
I doubt your almighty butler can do something about that.

178
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,030
Leave it to me!

179
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,710
Leave it to me, Milady.

180
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:29,730
I will use the lip-reading technique acquired from S** to read their conversation.

181
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:38,110
To be honest, I have someone I like.

182
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,430
To be honest, Saki, you are the one I love.

183
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,660
Someone... you like?

184
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,220
Yes.

185
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,370
I... love you, too.

186
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,680
So the person you like is?

187
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,260
A childhood friend of mine.

188
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,260
She used to be very cute, but...

189
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,730
That's the perspective of the guy in love.

190
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,960
She's broken down as she's gotten older.

191
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,040
Well... she was broken to begin with, but...

192
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,020
So what do you like about me?

193
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:12,540
How you'll be a young wife, cute,
and I want to make you go crazy. I want to break you.

194
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,290
But, you like her right?

195
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,480
Then do as you like to me?!

196
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:24,730
I don't know what she's thinks of me,
but emotions are hard to change, you know.

197
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,580
You're right, they are hard to change.

198
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,090
I'm more of a technician than I seem,
and I'll be sure to make you feel good.

199
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,760
Yes, if it feels good-

200
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,150
I can't take this anymore!

201
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,200
Saki!

202
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,340
You moron!

203
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,480
You'll only be hated if you dash in without a plan.

204
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,810
Yeah, she's got a point.

205
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,090
Th-Then what do I do?

206
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:48,280
How about a smack from behind with this to knock him out?

207
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,520
I'm not sure about that.

208
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,470
How about a globally standard way?

209
00:12:54,470 --> 00:13:01,540
Cause a crisis, jump out once we see how insignificant the man is, and then solve the crisis.

210
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,100
Th-That's my Hayate. You're smart.

211
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,860
No, not really.

212
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,940
That's getting too typical nowadays.

213
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,380
We're in the 21st century now.

214
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,400
Even Wataru won't go with-

215
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,990
Hayate! You're amazing to come up with such an idea!

216
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,560
Right? My butler is a genius!

217
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,860
Yeah, he is!

218
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,710
Please...

219
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,770
I don't think Wataru-kun watches dramas with these stereotypical turnarounds.

220
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:28,720
So if we are to use these stereotypical turnarounds, how do we make the crisis?

221
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,440
We'll use Tama.

222
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:30,890
Tama?

223
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,410
What is he doing here?

224
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,760
He came after hearing what Maria was mumbling.

225
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,270
So I have to watch the house alone.

226
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,070
Well, I'll take the chance to sing my lungs out.

227
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,950
Ka-kun yori Kino-ppi

228
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,950
Ka-kun yori Kino-ppi = Kino-ppi over Ka-kun.

229
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,990
Pitan osuki desuka?

230
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,990
Pitan osuki desuka? = Do you like pitang?

231
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,430
I guess I'll go clean the entire mansion.

232
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,490
It made me even more lonely.

233
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:19,870
What?

234
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:27,230
That's the story, so you jump out of the bushes and scare them a little.

235
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:30,040
Sure, but what do I get out of this?

236
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,650
Let's see...

237
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:37,720
How about I sell you to a circus
as a tiger that speaks if you don't do as I say?

238
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,600
Fine! Damn you.

239
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,580
Tama agreed to it.

240
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,560
You can talk with tigers?

241
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,920
Well, yes.

242
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,590
As expected from my butler!

243
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:47,930
Seriously!

244
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,040
Man, Hayate can be really cruel when he has such a cute face.

245
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,610
Seriously...

246
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,510
That's when Tama noticed a fearful killing intent.

247
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,500
Wh-What is this presence?

248
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,750
I'm told that animals can instinctively tell when something stronger than them is near, but...

249
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,690
My instincts still haven't forgotten that?

250
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,890
Th-This beastly presence...

251
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,940
I can't move.

252
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:31,090
I'm sorry I made you come to a marriage meeting and had you listen to my personal issues.

253
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,510
It's fine.

254
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:37,350
She's selfish and whimsical, and I often get angry at her,

255
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,730
but the more she's like that, the less I'm able to ignore her.

256
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,690
Selfish and whimsical and makes me angry?

257
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:50,810
To tell you the truth...

258
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:55,630
I also have a person I can't leave alone, as well.

259
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,720
I'm jealous.

260
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,650
I'm jealous of the person you care for so much.

261
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,020
Kaoru-san!

262
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,520
That's fast for Tama.

263
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,990
Now Wataru! Get your ass moving.

264
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,660
Y-Yeah!

265
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,190
Saki!

266
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,340
Are you all right, Saki?!

267
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,340
Sir!

268
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,430
What are you doing here?

269
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,850
Wah... Well... "What"?

270
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,550
Forget that, we need to get out of here!

271
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,800
But we can't leave Kaoru-san behind.

272
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,410
Don't worry, I'll go save him.

273
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,490
Good, good. It's turning in a good direction.

274
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,470
Yeah. Being stereotypical isn't bad once in a while.

275
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,120
I was trying to pounce on them, but then I sensed the presence of a really strong beast.

276
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,110
So I felt danger and came back.

277
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,400
What's wrong, Hayate?

278
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,830
Um, that beast we just saw was not Tama, apparently.

279
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,150
Th-Then what's over there?

280
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,570
It could be a real beast.

281
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,820
What?!

282
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,570
Sir! It's dangerous!

283
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:14,760
You get out of here, Saki.

284
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,520
Sir!

285
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,610
Come out, beast.

286
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,240
And let got of Kaoru-sensei.

287
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,320
Otherwise, I'll have to exterminate you!

288
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:25,950
Wataru-kun, it's not Tama, but a real beast hiding there.

289
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,430
You idiot!

290
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,800
Sir!

291
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,780
Bo** Conquest!

292
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:37,780
Sir!

293
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,580
Saki.

294
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,770
Katsura-sensei!

295
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,780
Y-Yukiji... What are you doing here?

296
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:54,620
I was here since yesterday for a marriage meeting party, since the drinks were free, but they said "enough" and kicked me out!

297
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,970
I got lost in the woods,
and now I'm hungry and not in a good mood!

298
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,970
Of course she'd get kicked out.

299
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,920
I haven't had nearly enough to drink!

300
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,220
Yeah...

301
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,730
So, we're going to go to Kabuki-chou to drink some more.

302
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,700
And you pay!

303
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,680
H-H-Help me! I want to go home!

304
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,340
Did you come because you were worried about my marriage meeting?

305
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,430
Th-The shop's busy, so let's end this meeting and go home.

306
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,230
Come on.

307
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,760
You're right. I don't think I can get married for a while.

308
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,320
Obviously not, you idiot.

309
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,860
Geez, he's like a little brother that needs a lot of attention.

310
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,290
Yes.

311
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:52,660
But, does he like Isumi or Saki-san?

312
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:57,520
For boys, there are many forms of "like".

313
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,720
I don't really get it, but boys can be complicated, too.

314
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,250
Yes.

315
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:07,870
By the way, Hayate. Was your lip reading accurate?

316
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,500
I'm pretty confident about it.

317
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,820
After the rain comes fair weather.

318
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,710
I don't really care about others' happiness.

319
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,570
And next week, we'll fight against suspense.

320
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,470
Ayasaki Hayate, huh?

321
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:29,180
That boy has quite a bit of potential.

322
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,720
That boy...

323
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,210
With this and that kind of clothes... and with cat ears...

324
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,810
Geez! Kuzuha-sama!

325
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,400
What's so good about him?

326
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,000
Don't be so jealous, Shion.

327
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,480
Wouldn't you want to make Ayasaki cry, as well?

328
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,810
Kuzuha-sama.

329
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,650
So, how long should I wait?

330
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,940
I'll get to you,

331
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,100
Mysterious Dark Butler One.

332
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:12,920
Defeat Ayasaki Hayate and bring him to us!

333
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:14,800
Yes, Ma'am.

334
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,580
Please, Kuzuha-sama.

335
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:27,730
Feel the wrath of the hitmen I send you.

336
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,260
What a peaceful day.

337
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,080
It's my turn!

338
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,280
Wh-What are you?!

339
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,970
My name is Duel Butler.

340
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,230
My turn!

341
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,130
Draw!

342
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,430
Wh-What's this?

343
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,900
Eh? This is...

344
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,460
Fight me, Ayasaki Hayate!

345
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,820
I don't really get it, but here I come!

346
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,240
My turn! Draw!

347
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,560
Magic card!

348
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,330
Summoning the White Hair Demon, Klaus and attack!

349
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,470
They'll come back even if you crush them.

350
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:19,460
The toughness is the fearsome part of my deck.

351
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,000
Activate Shield Trigger!

352
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,530
I won't let you!

353
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,460
Another draw!

354
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,090
I'll end it with the rare card, Ayasaki Hayate!

355
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,180
Let's do this, partner.

356
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,370
Yes, my other me.

357
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,640
I died in single turn?!

358
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,640
What?

359
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,270
Damn you! You better remember this!

360
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,850
What was this about?

361
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,940
"This week's"?

362
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,930
You mean this will continue?

363
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,190
Nagi and...

364
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,360
Hayate's...

365
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,520
Butler Network!

366
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,950
You summoned me so here I am, Sanzenin Nagi.

367
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,150
And Ayasaki Hayate's here.

368
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,130
And I'm Maria.

369
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,200
What? What are you doing here, Maria-san?

370
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,810
When the story takes place outside of the mansion,
I do not receive enough screentime, so they put me here today.

371
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,750
I see, it's that serious a matter.

372
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:53,010
But the majority of people watching this show want to see me, so I'm sure there's no big problem about that.

373
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,630
What? You think so?

374
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:57,010
I want to see more Maria-san in the show.

375
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,020
Oh my, Hayate-kun.

376
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,120
See you again.

377
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,550
Boo.

378
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,040
She's dead!

379
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,060
But I have already narrowed down who the culprit is.

380
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:07,880
What?

381
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,550
Will always come to the absolute truth.

382
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,860
Appears to be a tsundere and has the brain of a NEET.

383
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,840
Her name is Detective Nagi!

384
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,130
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

385
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:18,460
The Pretty Lady Detective has Witnessed.
The Female Teacher Murder Case at a Hot Spring.

386
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,060
There will be plenty of service shots.

387
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,770
Please enjoy it with your entire family.

388
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:27,990
Did you know? At a high rate, it's the third or fifth person in the cast that's the criminal.
