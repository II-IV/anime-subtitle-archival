1
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:09,390
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:09,990
Got it?

3
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,160
My dream.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,730
First Year, Peach Class, Ayasaki Hayate.

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:25,770
My father and mother are always being bums at home, regardless of it being weekday or weekend.

6
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,480
Father is searching for himself.

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,740
Mother is into finding a way to beat the slot machine.

8
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,020
Father says he'll take me to Hawaii if he wins the money,

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:44,020
But Mother says "We can't get passports, so that's impossible" and laughs, so my house is always filled with laughter.

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,690
And my dream is to...

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,140
Is it because of what I was told yesterday at Milady's home?

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,420
So in other words, your life is infinitely worthless, I take it.

13
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,280
No, come on! Keep it together!

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,110
I made up my mind, didn't I?

15
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:17,020
I don't know the meaning in my life, but right now, I'll protect Milady.

16
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,530
A butler is one who serves.

17
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,000
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

18
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,870
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

19
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,290
Yes.

20
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:41,850
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

21
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,300
Hello. Ayasaki Hayate here.

22
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,680
All right, I'll do my best today, too!

23
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,480
What? My dream?

24
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,550
Yes.

25
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:35,360
If I were pressed, there's one person whose future I'm really worried about,

26
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,750
so I would have to say my dream is for her to become a fine adult.

27
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,090
But why ask this all of a sudden?

28
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,480
Oh, well, how do I put it...

29
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,010
Dreams are like the motivation for people to live!

30
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,580
I-I guess.

31
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:58,020
Hold on, if you apply that theory,
my motivation to live is a little iffy.

32
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:04,690
Sakamoto Ryouma said that we should have a dream
as large as the Pacific, since we are born as humans.

33
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:09,280
And Mozart said that life has meaning because there are dreams.

34
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,040
A spy from England said that a person who can't come up with a huge dream must have a life worthless like trash.

35
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,440
Is something wrong, Maria-san?

36
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,470
No, I'm just going through a minor depression.

37
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,260
But still, Hayate-kun, you seem a little strange.

38
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,980
Did Nagi's grandfather say something to you?

39
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,880
I-It's like the idea of always remembering the mindset of a novice.

40
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,300
Anyway, I'm going to do my best as the butler Hayate.

41
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,090
Hold on...

42
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,970
I couldn't get a wink of sleep because of that.

43
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,910
I'll protect you from anyone who tries to make you cry.

44
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,640
Is that all right with you?

45
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,150
Hayate is so cool...

46
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,220
Hayate-kun's working hard.

47
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:19,250
He said something about the novice mind and a dream.

48
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,410
He did?

49
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,430
What dream?

50
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:27,870
He's working really hard,
like a businessman who has found meaning in life.

51
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,810
Could it be for the future between us?

52
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,720
Um, I think you have it wrong.

53
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,930
No, you mustn't!

54
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,390
Well, actually it's fine, but I'm not mentally prepared yet!

55
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,960
Um, how about you? Do you have a dream?

56
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,730
Of course. Wouldn't anyone have a lot?

57
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,660
Like I want to be a manga author
and sell 100 billion copies of what I publish.

58
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,670
Do you have something on your mind?

59
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,940
Nothing. You're too dazzling for me right now.

60
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,040
But what exactly could Hayate's dream be?

61
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,670
I don't know, but since he made such a big speech,
I'm sure he has something big.

62
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:14,920
But Nagi, I'm sure the dream you have in mind is different from what he has in his mind.

63
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,690
On another note, what could Hayate-kun's dream really be?

64
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,960
What? My dream?

65
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,770
Yes!

66
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:30,470
But that was like a kid's mistake, and it's embarrassing to say it.

67
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,470
Please don't worry, I won't laugh.

68
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,350
Um...

69
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,490
What is it?

70
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:46,050
Note: 3LDK is a Japanese housing term which stands for "3 individual rooms, Living room, Dining room, and Kitchen"

71
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,970
3LDK.

72
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,050
3LDK!

73
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:57,200
And my dream is to live in an apartment with 3 separate rooms
with a living room, dining room, and a kitchen.

74
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:02,000
I want to live in a 3LDK peacefully without being chased by anyone.

75
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,930
Tha... That's enough. You can stop now Ayasaki-kun.

76
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,470
And the reason is-

77
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:11,330
I-I see. So your dream is to live in a 3LDK.

78
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,350
Is that too big?

79
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,650
It doesn't have to be in Tokyo.

80
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,330
I think it's good.

81
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,730
Really?

82
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,240
The bigger the dream, the better...

83
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,180
Hayate-kun!

84
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,200
Yes?

85
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,100
I just remembered that your cell phone is still broken.

86
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,550
After all, it's inconvenient,
so please go buy another one with your budget.

87
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,270
Yes, then right away.

88
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:42,150
Oh, and you need to take some breaks once in a while,
so you can have the day off today.

89
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,530
So how about strolling around the city a little?

90
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,910
I bought a good one since I had the chance.

91
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,380
So this is what the One-Seg function is.

92
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,320
I can have a TV-Phone with it.

93
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,060
Wow, I can store 1,000 email addresses. This is amazing.

94
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,830
But I don't need that many.

95
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,560
I don't have that many friends.

96
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,100
Oh yeah, I wonder what my friends in high school are doing now.

97
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,740
School, eh...

98
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,360
I haven't had a chance to go,
so I haven't dealt with it all this time.

99
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,760
I did pay the entire tuition, didn't I?

100
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,480
What am I thinking? Could I still...

101
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,220
...want to return to school?

102
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,420
Okay!

103
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,090
I came on a whim, but it's hard to enter.

104
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:38,250
But I should still be a student of this school.

105
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,450
I have to not act suspicious.

106
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,520
Um...

107
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,030
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

108
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,990
I'm not a suspicious person, at all!

109
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,500
You're Hayate-kun, right?

110
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,010
Nishizawa-san?

111
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,330
I-It's been since Christmas when we last met.
What have you been doing up till now?

112
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,700
W-Well...

113
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,190
Souya-kun and the rest were all worried about you, too,
since you never come to school.

114
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,760
Well, a lot has happened since the end of last year.

115
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,390
A lot?

116
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,200
I'm not sure how to explain.

117
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,250
It's like, there's a huge debt, and my parents disappeared,

118
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,780
and I was given to very generous people as a present because of the debt.

119
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,340
C-Could it be...

120
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,750
Well, a lot has happened,
and I'm working as a butler at a certain mansion.

121
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:29,420
Oh, so it's a joke? You're such a kidder, Hayate-kun.

122
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:34,500
But I'm really glad. I'm finally able to see your face this year.

123
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,690
I'm really happy.

124
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,680
I-It's nothing. Don't take my words so seriously.

125
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,590
What are you doing flirting by the gate?

126
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,000
S-Souya-kun.

127
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,120
Hey, it's Hayate!

128
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,280
Rumor has it you quit school!

129
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,570
I haven't really quit it...

130
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,740
Really?

131
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,740
Aren't you glad, Nishizawa, to have your dear Prince back?

132
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,120
W-What are you saying?

133
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,390
Are you an idiot or something, Souya-kun?

134
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,350
It's only natural to worry about classmates, right?

135
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,320
But you were about to cry when you heard he'd quit.

136
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,540
So you were worried about me.

137
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,830
Thank you, Nishizawa-san.

138
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,960
O-Of course, since we're classmates.

139
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,760
Then, maybe I should try and come back.

140
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,560
What are you saying, Ayasaki.

141
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,100
You've dropped out.

142
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,710
Is it all right for the teacher to say such a lie?

143
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,610
Stop it, Nishizawa. I'm only speaking the truth.

144
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,680
Ayasaki's parents came here around noon on Christmas...

145
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,680
...and told us to give them back
the remaining tuition since he would no longer come.

146
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:48,910
Hayate-kun, weren't you paying your own tuition
since your parents wouldn't?

147
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,310
Yeah.

148
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,270
Then it's harsh for you to consider him dropped out
because you gave his parents the money.

149
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,690
But they said to give the money, so-

150
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,840
I see, so I can't go to school anymore.

151
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,960
Where are you going, Hayate-kun?

152
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,410
Are you really going to disappear like this?

153
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,130
You can't do that.

154
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,320
If we bring this up
before the board of education, then I'm sure...

155
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:17,600
If we do that, the teachers will have to take responsibility for my parents' selfishness.

156
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,190
Don't worry about me.

157
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,130
So, this is goodbye, Nishizawa-san.

158
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,270
It was only for a short time, but goodbye, my high school life.

159
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,740
Wait, Hayate-kun!

160
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,480
I love you, Hayate-kun!

161
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,250
I don't want to say goodbye like this.

162
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,790
So please go out with me!

163
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,620
The moment she said that, I realized something.

164
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:01,920
Without thinking, her face spontaneously came to mind.

165
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:11,760
Her sad face hit me hard.

166
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,190
Will you date me?

167
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,990
Um...

168
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,820
I'm sorry.

169
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,790
I'm...

170
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,780
...only interested in 2-D girls.

171
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,260
Gahhh!!!

172
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,970
That was a joke.

173
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,360
Actually right now, I have someone I can't leave untended.

174
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,770
You jerk!!!

175
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,400
To Hayate who's not used to girls,

176
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,060
he thought it'd be more manly to reject her
so she would come to hate him,

177
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,120
but comedy anime main characters never get dumped with dignity.

178
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,190
I've just returned.

179
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,350
Hey, Hayate.

180
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,120
What happened to your face?

181
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,190
A minor thing.

182
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,150
By the way, you bought a cell phone, right?

183
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,430
Show it to me.

184
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,850
What are you doing to it, Milady?

185
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:05,750
There.

186
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,940
I registered my address in the number 1 slot.

187
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,500
Thank you very much, Milady.

188
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,280
Yup. Call or email me as much as you like.

189
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:22,650
Yes.

190
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,930
Hayate-kun, I haven't given up on you.

191
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,950
Make sure you pay, okay?

192
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,890
Ichigo daifuku = Bean paste with strawberry

193
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,890
Ichigo daifuku

194
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,860
Kuru kuru mawaru yume nante... = Dreams of spinning drums are...

195
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,860
Kuru kuru mawaru yume nante...

196
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,220
Here Wataru-kun, I finished these, so I brought them back.

197
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,450
So how were they?

198
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,750
60%, I'd say.

199
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,150
I told you they're not movies girls can understand.

200
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:54,340
But I'm at an age that I want to understand guys' minds!

201
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,260
You learn about guys' minds from monster movies?

202
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,490
But Nishizawa-san, the boy you like quit school, right?

203
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:05,720
Yes! His house was empty and there wasn't any hint of him.

204
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,530
I wanted to meet him at least one more time and talk to him.

205
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:11,500
You'll never find a lost person like that, idiot.

206
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,400
Why do you say such a hopeless thing?!

207
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,150
Oh, Wataru-kun.

208
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:23,680
I don't usually watch them, but are animes interesting?

209
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:29,390
Only the ones I thought were interesting are on those shelves, but I don't know if you'd find them interesting.

210
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,250
Stop those "ehh"!

211
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,030
Listen! Interesting or uninteresting is only a personal opinion!

212
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,960
You'll never find out until you watch and check them out yourself!

213
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,650
So stop whining and watch!

214
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,600
Think, then act.

215
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,110
Think if it will be really interesting for you or not.

216
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,900
Now that's my coach!

217
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,150
But since they're all rented out, start with Getsumen To Heiki.

218
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,990
Bamboo... Bamboo...

219
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,010
Damn you bamboo vendor! Always getting in my way!

220
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,640
I-I just remembered something I need to do, so I'll head home!

221
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,410
Bamboo... Bamboo...

222
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,480
Damn, she got away.

223
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,170
Let's take better care of customers.

224
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:09,650
But can you really find someone who's disappeared in this huge city?

225
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,360
He must have been a really nice person.

226
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,860
Wataru-kun, we finished these, so I'm here to return them.

227
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,080
Hey debt-ridden butler. How were they?

228
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,000
I learned a good life lesson from them, but Milady didn't like them much.

229
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,810
The two never manage to meet.

230
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:27,890
However-

231
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:28,970
Oh no!

232
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:32,360
Kazuki asked for me to get a tape, didn't he?

233
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,430
No way, is that Hayate-kun?

234
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,240
To be able to meet at a place like this...

235
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,020
Are we destined to be?

236
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,410
It's no time to me to lose myself in a delusion.

237
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,390
I need to go after him!

238
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,020
Hayate-kun! Hayate-kun!

239
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,730
Hayate-kun!

240
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,070
Hayate-kun!

241
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,010
He's so fast. I can't catch up with him.

242
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,540
B-But I have to keep up so I don't lose sight of him.

243
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,910
He finally finished.

244
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,650
So could he be living here?

245
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,550
H-Huh?

246
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,650
W-Wait? It's more like a mansion than a house!

247
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,190
Why is Hayate-kun living here?

248
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:23,130
Oh yeah, Hayate-kun said something about being in debt or something.

249
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,160
Then this must be a yaku** house.

250
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,330
Hayate-kun must be going through lots of troubles in here.

251
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,040
Can we hear your story?

252
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,010
What? A suspicious girl?

253
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,650
We thought it might be one of Milady's friends, so we wanted to confirm.

254
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,470
Let me go! Let me go!

255
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,360
Black suits and scary faces!

256
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,730
They're definitely yaku**!

257
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,440
No!

258
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,160
I'm going to be treated to activities
that can't be made viewable for young audiences.

259
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,620
Public school?

260
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,430
Maybe she's from Hayate-kun's old school.

261
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:06,060
Well, it doesn't look like she's someone suspicious,
so please let her hands go.

262
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:06,190
Let me go! Let me go!

263
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:06,980
Yes.

264
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,980
Hey, let her hands go for now.

265
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,770
Yes!

266
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,140
She ran away!

267
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,240
Chance!

268
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,720
Um, I didn't say let her get away...

269
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,740
I'm sorry; we'll catch her right away.

270
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:30,800
I managed to get away, but I have no clue where Hayate-kun is.

271
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,140
But wow, yaku** people are amazing.

272
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:39,180
I bet Wataru-kun won't believe me
if I tell him a mansion this big exists.

273
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,940
Anyways, I have to find Hayate-kun fast and get out of here.

274
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,010
Comedic shot.

275
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,020
Realistic shot.

276
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,250
Why?!

277
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,050
Why is there a tiger at a house in Japan?!

278
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,870
I'll really die from this!

279
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,930
And it's chasing me!

280
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,930
Why am I chasing her?

281
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:05,360
Is this my hunting instinct I thought I had lost?

282
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,150
Oh no!

283
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,330
Then I shall listen to my instinct and...

284
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,100
...I shall...

285
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,190
Lick her all over!

286
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,610
No, that's the wrong instinct.

287
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,010
Hayate-kun!

288
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,410
Ina**ma Kick!

289
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,970
Ina**ma Kick!

290
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:31,030
It's an ultimate move for only those who have overcome hardship with effort and guts.

291
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,520
Um, I never trained, you know.

292
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,810
God... He's causing trouble as always.

293
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,400
And thanks to the DVDs we rented from Wataru-kun, I shouted out the attack name, as well...

294
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,440
This isn't what I meant by a life lesson.

295
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,400
Hayate-kun!

296
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,600
Eh, Nishizawa-san?

297
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,450
Thank goodness you're here.

298
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,700
Let's hurry and escape from here.

299
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,930
What?

300
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,370
Hey, Hayate.

301
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,270
What are you doing?

302
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,750
Milady!

303
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,230
There are things you can tell the moment you lay eyes upon others.

304
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,800
Hayate, who is that woman?

305
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,440
Ah, she's Nishizawa-san. My former classmate.

306
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,340
Hayate-kun, and she is?

307
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,010
She's Lady Nagi, this mansion's-

308
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,780
It's women's intuition.

309
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:37,090
The people who are destined to fight over someone dear to them.

310
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,200
The moment they saw each other, they both knew it.

311
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,960
They are rivals.

312
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,830
What? My background is a hamster?

313
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,230
It got eaten!

314
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,750
My hamster's weak, so weak!

315
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:07,940
Fine, I'll step aside for today,
but I'll bring a stronger hamster next time!

316
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,710
Rest assured and wait for me, Hayate-kun!

317
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,270
Nishizawa-san!

318
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:17,000
She's a funny person, as usual.

319
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,340
You can't, okay.

320
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,670
You can't leave me and go somewhere else, okay?

321
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,580
Please don't worry. I don't have
anywhere to go other than here.

322
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,250
Because there are those who can't even if they want to.

323
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,970
Um, Nagi?

324
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,130
I've decided!

325
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,410
Hayate has done a lot for me.

326
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,030
I must answer his kindness as his master.

327
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,880
Lady Nagi has made up some kind of mind.

328
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,540
Next time, we'll fight against the huge school again.

329
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,160
And leaving that aside...

330
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,190
For today, I'll borrow these.

331
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,690
Thanks a lot.

332
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,670
Business, business.

333
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,620
Kendama and Carrot is rented out!

334
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,540
Yes, they just got rented.

335
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,590
Andarta!

336
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,690
Wataru's video shop is making business.

337
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,790
They're having 50%-off service, too.

338
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:31,460
Nagi and...

339
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,390
Hayate's...

340
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,830
Butler Network!

341
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,420
Hello, I'm Ayasaki Hayate.

342
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,820
I'm Sanzenin Nagi.

343
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,890
Starting today, the BGM will be Milady's song.

344
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:46,030
Yes. The ability to sing is an important factor as the next head of Sanzenin family.

345
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:49,970
It describes well how rough and hard to tame you are.

346
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,090
It's a wonderful song.

347
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,300
What, is that supposed to be a compliment?

348
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,240
Of course, it is.

349
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,470
You can sense your charming acts from the song.

350
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,490
Charming? You make me blush.

351
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,780
Bye bye!

352
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,750
Milady, some paperwork has arrived from Hakuou Academy.

353
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,180
It's a transfer form.

354
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:05,760
For you.

355
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,760
Oh mine.

356
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,720
What do you mean mine?!

357
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,940
It's paperwork for you to transfer in.

358
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,690
Then I'll let you hear my application process story.

359
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:17,420
I'll tell you what Hakuou's exam style and questions are like.

360
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,700
No thanks.

361
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,660
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

362
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,450
Those Who Seize the Summer Seize the Application Process.

363
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,890
You're the person I have faith in,

364
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,580
so let's go to school together.

365
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,310
Run up to the stage of dreams!
