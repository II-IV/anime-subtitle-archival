1
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,440
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,020
Got it?

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,960
It's nice to wake up early once in a while; I met an interesting person.

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:19,870
Nonohara!

5
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:20,770
Come over here, Nonohara.

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,040
Your opponent is this combat butler, Nonohara Kaede.

7
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,510
A butler is one who serves.

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,010
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

9
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:38,000
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,260
Yes.

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:47,900
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,910
Yes! Today will be a kendo showdown!

13
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,960
Your opponent will be my butler, Nonohara Kaede.

14
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,990
Butler?

15
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,720
So hello, I'm Nonohara Kaede.

16
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,380
I'm a butler of the Azumamiya family.

17
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,180
He's a butler, too?

18
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,910
It's him, Nonohara.

19
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,110
Knock him out right now!

20
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,520
As you order.

21
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,720
But before that...

22
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,130
Down, diagonal left down, left, kick.

23
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,740
It's not a Hurri**** Kick!

24
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,120
N-Nonohara, what are you...

25
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,330
Sir, did I not teach you?

26
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,520
If you are a man, put up a fight even if you know you would lose.

27
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:32,030
Yet, you rely on others without fighting, and you don't do anything.

28
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,960
I don't recall...

29
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,160
...raising you to be such a weakling!

30
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,030
Y-You wouldn't go that far, would you, Himuro?

31
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,670
Nonohara-kun is strict as always.

32
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,610
But is it all right?

33
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,850
He's a butler, yet he's...

34
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,940
What are you talking about?

35
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,280
We butlers aren't our masters' tools.

36
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,740
Just doing what they tell us to do isn't everything.

37
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,660
"Butler" used to be a highly honorable position that only the first born of a noble family could become.

38
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,440
In other words, there's that much responsibility involved in the position.

39
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,380
The responsibility to guide one's master along the right course.

40
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:19,840
Isn't that why you wanted to teach her the pleasure of sports?

41
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,680
To your hikikomori, weak, spineless, manga nerd of a master?

42
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,780
Who are you calling a hikikomori, weak, spineless manga nerd of a master?

43
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,980
I-I'm sorry, Nonohara!

44
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,810
I got it! I got it!

45
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,450
No. I won't forgive you today.

46
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,480
I will amend your rotten mind...

47
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,930
...starting with your spine!

48
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,030
NO!!!

49
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,440
Please don't make too much commotion in the dojo, Nonohara-san.

50
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,180
Katsura-san.

51
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:02,630
This is our educational style, so would you please not interfere?

52
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,620
I'm sorry, but I really can't do that.

53
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,860
I'm the Student Council President,
so I can't stop myself from helping a student in need.

54
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,160
Katsura-san...

55
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,200
Even if Azumamiya-kun is a weak and pathetic crybaby, I have to help him.

56
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,920
Huh?

57
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,020
Wonderful, President.

58
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,960
Way to strike directly at the opponent's vital point.

59
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,510
I didn't hit his vital point!

60
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,100
Okay, I get it, Nonohara.

61
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,000
I can't be weak anymore!

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,930
Sir!

63
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,620
A man must fight and open his own path!

64
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,650
Sir! So you understand!

65
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,450
Therefore!

66
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,240
Fight me, Sanzenin!

67
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,180
EHH?!

68
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,690
Um, Azumamiya-kun. May I ask the reason?

69
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,860
I promise I won't get angry.

70
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,670
I understand what my mistake was.

71
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,380
It's weird for the master and the butler to fight.

72
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,700
Or rather, there's no chance.

73
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,010
Then the correct answer is for master to fight master, and butler to fight butler!

74
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,210
Is he right in the head?

75
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,500
No, I don't think so.

76
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,890
Looks like it's hard for butlers to lead their master down the correct course.

77
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,490
Master! That's wonderful!

78
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,710
So you finally understand that.

79
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,360
So you're fine with that...

80
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,640
So they say, Nagi. What are you going to do?

81
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,710
Don't ask me.

82
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,220
Oh, fine.

83
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,470
Then I'll fight against Azumamiya-kun.

84
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,670
Hey, Hinagiku?

85
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:43,860
If you start swinging swords all of a sudden,
your body's going to break,

86
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,350
since you haven't practiced at all.

87
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,570
And, even though Azumamiya-kun is the weakest on the team,

88
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,430
because he's the least professional,
his strikes are all random and dangerous.

89
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,200
It'd be terrible if two people who don't know how to use a sword fought and got injured.

90
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,650
Huh? Azumamiya-kun?

91
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,170
It's fine... Looks like a match with you is an unavoidable fate.

92
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,910
Wow, Hinagiku-san... She keeps on hitting him right at the vital point without even trying.

93
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:16,730
Then all I have to do is to prove
I'm stronger than you with this sword!

94
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,900
Let's go, Nonohara!

95
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,090
Yes, sir!

96
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,780
So that's how it is. Let's do this, Hayate-kun.

97
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,970
Y-Yes!

98
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:27,760
I must win this match and have Milady continue with kendo!

99
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,390
Win or lose, I don't have any intention of returning to the Kendo Club.

100
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,040
Yotsuba no clobber miitsuketa.
I found a four-leafed clover.

101
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,040
Yotsuba no clobber miitsuketa.

102
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,050
Tama tama nandesu. Tasukete Nonohara!

103
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,050
Tama tama nandesu. Tasukete Nonohara!
It was an accident. Help me Nonohara!

104
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:02,660
Dear audience, for your reference, when you have a kendo match, make sure to put protectors on for your safety.

105
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,960
In anime, they don't put them on due to troubles involving redrawing cels and other adult issues.

106
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,910
Entering the Road to the Devil and Hell.

107
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,810
Does he have an acceleration device in his back teeth?

108
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,210
H-He's fast. Reacting is all I can do.

109
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,750
Here I go!

110
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,640
I didn't think I'd end up fighting you.

111
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,670
This is a wall that I have to face for the sake of my love.

112
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:39,150
But I will defeat you and prove that I'm a man!

113
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:43,650
Azumamiya-kun, I have no clue what you're talking about.

114
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,360
But if you talk too much, you'll bite your tongue.

115
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,880
Men!

116
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,720
Nice strike, President.

117
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,810
The Azumamiya boy had no chance.

118
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,040
Of course. Hinagiku wouldn't lose to someone like him.

119
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,470
But I wonder how the butler side of things will turn out.

120
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,700
I wonder if he's good enough to beat Nonohara-kun.

121
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,400
Don't joke with me! Are you saying that Hayate will lose to that guy's butler?

122
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,690
All right.

123
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,310
Hayate-kun, how is it going there?

124
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,610
Safety Shutter!

125
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,120
Hayate!

126
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,870
What was that about?

127
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,660
"What"? It was his ultimate move, of course.

128
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,530
Huh?

129
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:48,540
Any professional butler should possess one or two ultimate moves.

130
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,500
In fact, it's strange not to have them.

131
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:56,270
Something similar to Ryu*** Rambu and Hyakki *******ken, where the commands are unnecessarily complicated?

132
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,480
That's only inside games!

133
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,760
I had heard the Sanzenin's butler is strong,
but this is all you have?

134
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,050
He's unbelievable.

135
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,310
An ultimate move?

136
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,530
So this is what professional butlers are like.

137
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,000
But if I lose here, Milady will never practice kendo again.

138
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,300
Are you all right, Hayate?

139
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,130
I'll end this match with the next move.

140
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,770
But what can I do?

141
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,370
A move to deflect his ultimate move...

142
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,070
It's impossible.

143
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,570
Besides, it usually takes a full episode to gain an ultimate move.

144
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,070
It's impossible to learn an ultimate move in this short a time.

145
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,790
Hayate, I have faith in you!

146
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:15,630
I know you can come up with a counter, like how Buf****man made a comeback against Kinniku ***ter!

147
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,520
I'm happy that you have faith in me, but I'm not superhuman.

148
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,500
Believe in yourself!

149
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,490
A butler...

150
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:30,490
A butler is not fulfilling his responsibilities when he cannot see the trash on the floor while cleaning the room.

151
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,310
"You find only caterpillars on leaves!"

152
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,440
That's a completely wrong usage of the reference.

153
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,860
Ready?

154
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,380
Ultimate move...

155
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,160
Trash on the floor...

156
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,030
Trash?

157
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,720
I get it!

158
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:49,920
Safety Shutter!

159
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,200
Hayate!

160
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,630
No, he's...

161
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,030
Sir!

162
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,170
Hayate!

163
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,100
Men!

164
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,430
We lost. As expected from the butler of Sanzenin.

165
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,250
It was nothing. I only took advantage of your moment of shock.

166
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:44,570
It was a wonderful tactic that used my ingrained inability to use my ultimate move when I see his pathetic face.

167
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,900
I only used the ninja move where you use a substitute.

168
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,270
And you can use that ninja move?

169
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,800
Excuse us now.

170
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:02,160
I'd be happy if you had an ultimate move ready by the next time we meet.

171
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,830
Then I can put up a more serious fight.

172
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,060
So?

173
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,140
Do you feel like doing kendo now?

174
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:22,110
W-Well, watching you and Hayate fight,
it did make me think that you two are cool.

175
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,740
Milady...

176
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,550
But I have no intention of returning to the Kendo Club.

177
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,790
Because kendo head protectors stink.

178
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,760
I don't understand how people feel like exercising with that thing on.

179
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,640
Besides, in kendo manga, the protector gets in the way,

180
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,870
so you can't tell one character from another, and you can't see their expressions either.

181
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,860
Don't mock kendo!

182
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,000
What was that for?!

183
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:54,130
Looks like it's impossible for Nagi to come to the Kendo Club, but how about you?

184
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,610
As a butler, you need to learn an ultimate move, right?

185
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,910
I don't mind helping you train.

186
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,720
I'm thinking that I'd have to train in order to come up with an ultimate move, but...

187
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,060
Hayate, get over here already.

188
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,030
Ah, yes!

189
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,660
Then, I'm sure you'll have to go through a lot of training,

190
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,990
but when you come up with one, make sure you show it to me.

191
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,190
Your special ultimate move.

192
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,110
Yes.

193
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,020
Was Hinagiku still angry?

194
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,160
Why was she so angry?

195
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,120
There are things you're not supposed to comment on.

196
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,190
Her awakening for sports is still far away.

197
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,690
Thank you very much, Maria-san.

198
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,640
What's the formality for?

199
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:50,700
Thanks to you, I was able to experience the high school life
I thought I'd never be able to experience again.

200
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,870
I see. I'm happy for you.

201
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,620
So how was your first day?

202
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:01,800
I thought high school life isn't necessary to become a professional butler,

203
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,220
but I learned a lot about what it takes to become a professional.

204
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,180
I-I see.

205
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,760
Hayate, come here a second.

206
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,660
Yes.

207
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,060
How may I help you, Milady?

208
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,220
I-I was happy when you fought for me.

209
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,340
I only did what every butler should.

210
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,950
Besides, I found out that I need
an ultimate move as a butler, too.

211
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,980
Yes, that!

212
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,580
I gave it some thought, too, but how about getting yourself a ma***tic coating,

213
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:41,480
or starting black *****, or get a ****let from a **der.

214
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,990
I'm not sure about that.

215
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:47,510
I'm not a white demon, nor a gagged eyebrow boy.

216
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,980
And I don't have a friend who watches the stars.

217
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:57,300
Yes, therefore I realized the best way is to learn an ultimate move the correct way.

218
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:57,840
Huh?

219
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,260
So I made this for you as a thank you for today.

220
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,530
Um, is this...

221
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:17,160
Yes. Ultimate moves comes from training in the Tiger's Den.

222
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,110
Give it your best shot!

223
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,560
That's something only a 40+ year-old would understand.

224
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,040
I knew it'd be you.

225
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,970
I'm not dressed like this by choice, either!

226
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,010
Why should I bother with this?

227
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,980
Let's get your training started.

228
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,710
Hey, stop it! Don't become realistic all of a sudden!

229
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,450
I see he started to train right away.

230
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,530
He must have liked it.

231
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:50,390
At times, a master's kindness is unnecessary.

232
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:56,350
Anyways, the debt-ridden butler's first day at school ends like this.

233
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:00,670
Next time, we'll fight against housekeeping, laundry, and cooking.

234
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,390
Ultimate move, Frying Pan Flip!

235
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,880
Perfect.

236
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,920
Ramen daisuki. Koike-san no uta.
I love Ramen. Sung by Koike-san.

237
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,680
Ramen daisuki. Koike-san no uta.

238
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,920
Tama tama Tama ni attara "Tama" tte yonndene!

239
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,920
Tama tama Tama ni attara "Tama" tte yonndene!
If you see Tama in the streets, make sure you shout, "Tama!"

240
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,890
Klaus-kun's Glutton! Wonderful!

241
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,370
I'm hungry.

242
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,870
Okay, I'll imitate a few people.

243
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,770
Imitation of Jack ***er.

244
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,700
"It's Season 5!"

245
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,780
Imitation of Co***y.

246
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,490
Note: Convoy is the Japanese name for Optimus Prime.

247
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:53,420
"********, tran****m and roll out!"

248
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,470
Imitation of a golden hour movie channel.

249
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,320
"Next week's ***** movie is..."

250
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,890
Imitation of a bo***g story.

251
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,840
"Bo***g story..."

252
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,360
And now...

253
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,180
Ah, single shiritori.

254
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,460
Klaus...

255
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,250
Super car keshigomu...

256
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,240
Super car keshigomu = Super car eraser.

257
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,400
Muruwakka...

258
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,400
Muruwakka = ????????

259
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:21,850
Ka-

260
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,830
From the Windows of Trains Around the World.

261
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,240
Are we at Rio de Janeiro yet?

262
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,930
Next time will be on Marunouchi Line,
between Ogikubo and South Asagaya Station.

263
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,260
****y's Puppy.

264
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:31,190
Today's puppy is from Tokyo Nerima Ward and is sunbathing.

265
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,150
A White Tiger Cat, his name is Tama.

266
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,150
No. No matter how you see, that's not a puppy.

267
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:37,900
Hayate!

268
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,120
Hayate!

269
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,070
Let's play, Hayate!

270
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,140
What do we want to play with?

271
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,050
Stop it!

272
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,230
How about "Face the Way I Point"?

273
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:47,600
Tama loves to play with his master, who is a butler.

274
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,280
The house we explore today is the Sanzenin villa.

275
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,350
The family members consist of the Lady, who enjoys her NEET life.

276
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:03,510
The maid, Maria-san, who enjoys flower arrangement.

277
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,300
Now let's go check the house out.

278
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,840
The pillar's nice.

279
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,670
I see.

280
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,980
It really is a thorough job.

281
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,470
Uses only the genuine material.

282
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,220
The sense of security you feel the moment you enter.

283
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,450
The craftsmanship you can let your eyes enjoy.

284
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,980
And this is!

285
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,110
A well-lit sunroom.

286
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,840
And the foliage set around the room.

287
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:40,010
I have a fetish for foliage.

288
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,800
This makes me happy.

289
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:48,090
After going through the bright arch of the sun,
you reach the LDK apartments.

290
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:48,090
Note: LDK stands for "Living room, Dining room, Kitchen"

291
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:53,790
Next time, we'll show the house where you can enjoy the slivers of light.

292
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,720
Look forward to it.

293
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,080
That was good.

294
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,930
See you next week.

295
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,270
Nagi and...

296
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,210
Hayate's...

297
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,890
Butler Network!

298
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,530
Sorry for the wait. I'm Sanzenin Nagi.

299
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,650
I'm Ayasaki Hayate.

300
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,670
We have Hinagiku-san with us today, too.

301
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,240
I'm Katsura Hinagiku. Hi folks!

302
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,890
You look happy, Hayate.

303
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:48,550
Well, having Hinagiku-san show up makes the anime itself wilder.

304
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,280
I don't sleep while hugging a doll like that.

305
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,490
Hayate, you're making a mistake.

306
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:53,750
Eh?

307
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,250
The heroine of this anime is...

308
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,700
Hayate, it's you!

309
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,620
EH?!

310
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,850
Bye bye.

311
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,220
What's wrong, Milady?

312
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,600
I, apparently, don't have enough experience in life.

313
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,530
The reason I can't win anything from the manga I draw is because I don't have enough experience in life.

314
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:12,000
H-Huh...

315
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,500
Then I'll do things I usually don't do and gain experience points!

316
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,270
What?!

317
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,370
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

318
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,870
For Your Sake, I'll Give My Best Blasting Through Everything.

319
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:23,840
I will give you VIP service.

320
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,220
You better be ready for this.

321
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,450
Come get us if you dare!
