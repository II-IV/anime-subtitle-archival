1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,230
When watching TV,

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,770
make sure the room is well lit,

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,020
and watch from a distance.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,020
Got it?

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,850
Sh-She's dead!

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,930
But I have already narrowed down who the culprit is.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,880
That is one of those dying messages.

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,040
I bet not.

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,880
Who's there?

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,420
You were behind all of this?

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,560
One who masters being a butler becomes the master of the world.

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:56,070
The Butler War that shakes the planet has started!

13
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,070
This week's Hayate is filled with suspense.

14
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,070
But please enjoy it with your entire family like you normally do.

15
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,440
The autumn wind really feels good.

16
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,540
Yes it does, Milady.

17
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,510
The foliage looks beautiful, too.

18
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,850
It was good to come all the way to a hot spring.

19
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,880
Yeah, really.

20
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,550
By the way Milady, which one is the inn we'll be staying at?

21
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,570
That one!

22
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,820
That?!

23
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,320
Wow, it's so classical.

24
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,080
The best way to enjoy a hot spring is to waste time at a rotting inn.

25
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,060
But I get this portentous feeling from there.

26
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,610
What?

27
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,770
It's emitting an untouchable vibe.

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,420
You just heard a scream from the inn, right?

29
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,060
Yes.

30
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,030
What's the matter here?

31
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,120
What happened?

32
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,590
Um, you look different from the opening.

33
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,060
Shut up! That situation would make me unable to get married!

34
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,140
I can smell a crime.

35
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,670
You just committed it.

36
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,300
I didn't expect to get caught up
in a murder case at a hot spring.

37
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,820
How entertaining.

38
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,880
I mean, we're in trouble.

39
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,750
We must contact the police.

40
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,090
R-Right.

41
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,980
We have a problem. We have a problem.

42
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,350
There is no need for that.

43
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,500
Will always come to the absolute truth.

44
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,550
Appears to be a tsundere and has the brain of a NEET.

45
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,160
Her name is Detective Nagi!

46
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,130
That bag for grade schoolers fits you surprisingly well.

47
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,360
That's not what you're supposed to jab at!!!

48
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,810
Onee-chan!

49
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,740
I always thought of you as a hopeless sister, but who knew this would happen...

50
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,780
I'm sorry for you, but please hold yourself together.

51
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,560
Yes, I know.

52
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,130
Actually, I have something I want you all to see.

53
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:29,580
What?

54
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,480
A video tape?

55
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,870
Yes. This just arrived for me by motorbike delivery.

56
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,580
I think it's something my sister took.

57
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,260
I wonder if it's recording okay.

58
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,440
This is this room, right?

59
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,700
Yes, it looks like it.

60
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:57,350
Hina. By the time you watch this,
I might already have become a star in the sky.

61
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,050
I guess the saying that pretty people die young was true.

62
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,240
Unbelievable what she can say.

63
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,450
Um, the background has...

64
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:11,830
To tell you the truth, I've been told to come
to this inn by an unknown individual through a letter.

65
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,460
It sounds like the person holds a grudge against me.

66
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,160
But I still don't have a clue who it is.

67
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,730
I think the person should be coming to this room soon, but...

68
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,400
I'm starting to lose interest.

69
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:32,620
Hina! If I die, then the person who killed me
will be the next person who appears on this screen.

70
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,390
Make sure you catch that person and get all the reparations you can for me.

71
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,310
Do you hear?

72
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,400
She's here!

73
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,810
It ends there?

74
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,920
No way, it stopped at the most crucial point.

75
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,380
This is horrible.

76
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,610
It's as bad as a mother who tricks her children by calling a honey-coated cucumber a melon.

77
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,280
No, it's as bad as saying pudding with soy sauce is sea urchin.

78
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:53,900
No, no.

79
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,230
It's as bad as calling an orange with seaweed and soy sauce a salmon roe.

80
00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:02,330
This tape... The criminal must have physically cut him or herself out of the tape, then sent it.

81
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,780
So, this is a challenge letter to me from the criminal.

82
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,780
But I have already narrowed down who the culprit is.

83
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,570
Really?

84
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,330
Yes. The criminal is...

85
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,410
The criminal is?

86
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,300
You!!!

87
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,620
Me?

88
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,730
I'm only a guest staying next door.

89
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:29,510
As well as a super side character
that hasn't shown up since episode 23.

90
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,540
I can tell everything that happened.

91
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,340
I was in episode 25, too!

92
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,710
You called the victim out and...

93
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,420
Don't come any closer!

94
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,050
You try and touch me,

95
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,280
and I'll have you pay all my pub bills that have piled up!

96
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,220
Using a polka-dot snake that just happened to pass by...

97
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:59,930
That's what happened. So, isn't it a perfect deduction?

98
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,660
Well...

99
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,640
You just copied the most famous trick.

100
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,340
Apologize to Mr. Doyle.

101
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,710
You are under arrest.

102
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,180
No, it wasn't me.

103
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,960
I will hear no words from you. Give it up.

104
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,880
No.

105
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,580
Grab.

106
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,350
Break.

107
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,840
Don't treat my honey as a criminal.

108
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,050
Watch out, Milady.

109
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,340
Nice one, Hayate.

110
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,520
Milady, the criminal seems to be someone else.

111
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,920
Yes, to be honest, I had that feeling, too.

112
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,920
I see...

113
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,370
Then the next most suspicious ones are you three.

114
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,510
Wh-Where am I?

115
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:54,350
You called the victim out,
and using a polka-dot octopus that passed by...

116
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,730
There you have it.

117
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,770
What is this polka-dot octopus?

118
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,640
We weren't even in that scene!

119
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,890
Stop resisting and be arrested!

120
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,600
There is someone else who's likely to have a motive, isn't there?!

121
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,430
Right, a motive.

122
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,060
Yes, you have a point.

123
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,670
An individual who probably holds
the biggest grudge against the victim is...

124
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,470
Who else other than the debt-ridden butler?

125
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,530
Wait, what are you saying?

126
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,650
Glare~

127
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,650
All of you, please don't glare at me with those suspecting eyes.

128
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,630
You're the one person I trusted.

129
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,190
I said it's not me.

130
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,420
I told you it's not me!

131
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,460
Using a polka-dot elephant that passed by...

132
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,550
You look as if you wouldn't even kill an insect, and yet...

133
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:46,050
Milady, your deductions are only taking place in the wilderness.

134
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,310
Ah, is this Yama-san?

135
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:49,890
I have the criminal in hand,
but the victim won't be coming back.

136
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:50,330
Besides, the setting has changed from the inn to Africa all of a sudden.

137
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,120
How about we go to the roof top
for another chat under the sunset?

138
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,730
And who are you talking to, anyway?

139
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,340
Hey!

140
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,700
How many times do you have to kill me?

141
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,050
The story isn't progressing at all!

142
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:03,100
Mind you, it's really embarrassing to play dead in this outfit.

143
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,960
Hinagiku!

144
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,420
Ah, yes!

145
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,690
You better do it properly as the script says.

146
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,490
Yes...

147
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,860
Collapse.

148
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,500
Hey, what's that?

149
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,540
Blood: Hibiya

150
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,900
That has to be one of those dying messages.

151
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,360
What's a dying message?

152
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,240
You don't even know that?

153
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,840
Allow me to explain.

154
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,480
A dying message is a hint the victim leaves behind on purpose to aid later deduction.

155
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,490
Tama's Last Words: Cheney

156
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:33,750
I see.

157
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,990
But, what's "Hibiya"?

158
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,590
Allow me to explain again.

159
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:42,570
Hibiya is an area in Tokyo made up of
the Choyoda ward and Yuuraku-chou, close to Ginza.

160
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:47,830
As a bit of trivia, this is where
the very first street light in Japan was installed.

161
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,780
We don't need to know that kind of trivia.

162
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,570
Anyway, if we can decode this dying message, we can figure out who the criminal is, right?

163
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,830
It's starting to become like a real detective story.

164
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,720
Yeah.

165
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,840
But this is very hard.

166
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,900
Hard?

167
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,950
No, not yet.

168
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,620
This is nowhere close to the mystery behind the pyramids and UFOs!

169
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,460
What did she say?!

170
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:14,050
Um, I'm not sure about using that other glasses character.

171
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,210
Exactly!

172
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,560
You, indeed, are my assistant. You have good instincts.

173
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,930
D-Do I?

174
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:26,200
As he suggests, this crime was committed by a character that's not here.

175
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,270
Another character?

176
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:33,990
Yes. The criminal must be hiding somewhere after committing the murder.

177
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,210
And the location is?

178
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,260
You're not going to say Hibiya, are you?

179
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,150
Take a good second look at it.

180
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,590
It says Hibiya no matter how you read it.

181
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:50,690
No, the ********* seeds around it are part of the message, too.

182
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,860
Look, the written part is the right side of kanji.

183
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,950
And if you treat the ********* seeds as radicals,

184
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,580
Words: Coed Bath

185
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,920
You can read "coed bath" from it.

186
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,570
Isn't it amazing?

187
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,590
Unbelievable deduction.

188
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:09,950
And, at this inn, there happens to be a coed bath, too.

189
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,740
The criminal has to be here.

190
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,790
I really don't think that's possible.

191
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,730
There!

192
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,240
Who could the criminal be?

193
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,930
Continue to the second part.

194
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,900
Kaneme no mono wo! Hayaku!

195
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,900
Kaneme no mono wo! Hayaku! = Grab the valuables! Fast!

196
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,870
Kuminzei, haratta?

197
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,870
Kuminzei, haratta? = Did you pay your taxes?

198
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,110
Drop Out Trio's Glutton Dreamy Mood!

199
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,030
Hey.

200
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,940
What?

201
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,460
How about we make things clear. Are we to eat or provide a service shot in the hot spring?

202
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,360
Eh?

203
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,120
The potency of this spring is-

204
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,840
Risa-chin, you're supposed to do that after we eat!

205
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,020
It's a merry-go-round of flavor!

206
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,500
No, you haven't eaten one yet!

207
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,500
Gilgamesh.

208
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,660
That's the wrong show!

209
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,000
This tastes so good.

210
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,740
Who's there?

211
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,470
Don't say that it looks different from before.

212
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,510
M-Maria-san. When did you get here?

213
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,950
And, you are the criminal, Maria-san?

214
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,200
I'm not!

215
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,060
Then why?

216
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,290
Don't worry about the details.

217
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,600
Sexy shots have to happen in a suspense story.

218
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:38,570
We are using a towel for the sake of broadcasting restrictions,
but in reality, please do not use a bath towel in the bath.

219
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,670
Gosh!

220
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,680
Let's keep this going and let the second "must have" happen!

221
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,710
Gourmet food scene!

222
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,510
There it is.

223
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:50,920
Please enjoy the fresh seafood!

224
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,550
Afterwards, we have a magic show scheduled.

225
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,090
Here's your lukewarm gasoline.

226
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,790
Good stuff~

227
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,160
On to the third "must have"!

228
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,860
Inquiry at a bar!

229
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,700
So, what do you want?

230
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,070
Does this person ring a bell?

231
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,760
Ring a bell?

232
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,310
A loud one!

233
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:25,280
That girl is my older sister's friend's cousin
and the burglar that took my boyfriend away!

234
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,950
Rather than a suspense show,
it's becoming an afternoon soap opera.

235
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,460
Here's the fourth "must have".

236
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,360
Mada mada dane!

237
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,860
Yay!

238
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,330
Advantage, Makimura-Izumi.

239
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,750
Yes, it's getting exciting.

240
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,670
It's all messed up.

241
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,560
We have trouble!

242
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,090
Maria-san! You were in the hot spring until now?

243
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:50,950
Yes.

244
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:55,480
I went back to our room once, and I found this terrifying thing.

245
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,230
What is it, Maria? Stop beating around the bush and tell us.

246
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,100
The corpse is gone!

247
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,620
She's right.

248
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,790
It is gone.

249
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,090
A disappearing body. The most suspenseful moment in a suspense story.

250
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,250
Oh no. The case is about to become forever wrapped in mystery.

251
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,660
But, who hid it?

252
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,730
The criminal, of course.

253
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,780
The criminal?

254
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:22,400
Yes, must be trying to cause confusion in me to disrupt the investigation.

255
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,510
In that case...

256
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,900
Wh-What is this all of a sudden?

257
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,850
I'm sure they can find the key clue.

258
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,040
And here's something under the table.

259
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,060
Th-This is-

260
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,160
It looks like a voice recorder.

261
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,320
Show it to me.

262
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,840
Is this the scream we originally heard?

263
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,440
It sounds like it.

264
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,680
But why?

265
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,600
What's the significance behind it?

266
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,680
It's hereâ”

267
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,670
The mystery is solved, my dear Watson.

268
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,320
"M-My dear Watson"...

269
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,810
Next Nagi's hint.

270
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:10,720
Video.

271
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,560
So, have you figured out the criminal and the trick behind it?

272
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,530
Um...

273
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,210
Give me a snack.

274
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,810
Oh, I mean, Trick or Treat.

275
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,270
Trick or Treat.

276
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,640
W-Wait, give me candy!

277
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,780
Trick or Treat.

278
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,200
Halloween isn't celebrated around Japan well at all.

279
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,150
This is a different kind of trick.

280
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,760
Why are we at a place like this all of a sudden?

281
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:53,870
It can't be helped. Climax scenes by a cliff are the greatest "must have" in a suspense show.

282
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:57,510
Everything is perfect if we have Funa**** Jirou.

283
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,070
Allow me to explain the truth behind this case now.

284
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,640
Hey!

285
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,640
The scene of the crime was not that room.

286
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:11,940
If we assume the crime took place in a completely different room at a completely different inn, everything makes sense.

287
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,890
What do you mean? Explain one piece at a time so it makes sense.

288
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:16,620
Sure.

289
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,800
First, the criminal met the victim at a certain inn.

290
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,200
Recorded the victim's voice during the incident.

291
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,640
After that, took the victim to a room at a separate inn that looks similar,

292
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,290
Wait, wait, wait, it'll show! It'll show! It'll show!

293
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,040
in other words, carried her into that room we were in, and...

294
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,490
Be gentler with me! No, stop!

295
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,450
Gentler!

296
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:44,840
...made others hear the scream using a timer to think that the crime had just happened.

297
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,140
You just heard a scream from the inn, right?

298
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:44,830
Yes.

299
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,290
Everything was planned to create an alibi.

300
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:53,170
Here! Here, here! I have a question!

301
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,140
What is it?

302
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,200
Where's the proof?

303
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,500
I think the voice recorder alone is pushing it a little.

304
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:04,100
The greatest proof is on the video we watched.

305
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,700
In here!

306
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,570
Play.

307
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,800
I wonder if it's recording fine.

308
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,180
Stop!

309
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,440
I don't see anything suspicious.

310
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,770
Don't you notice something about that wall scroll?

311
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,710
It's completely different from the one in that room.

312
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,940
Exactly.

313
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:31,960
The criminal wasn't able to keep an eye open for the wall scroll.

314
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,670
There are four other mistakes, as well.

315
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:37,230
Those who get them correct will get-

316
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,510
Coming this far, you all know who the criminal is, right?

317
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,610
I remember one person coming late!

318
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,180
And that individual brought the video, right?

319
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:55,350
She said something about
a motorbike delivering it and what not.

320
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:59,420
But if she is the criminal, then everything does make sense.

321
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,500
Then...

322
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,300
M-Me?

323
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:08,210
Hinagiku-san, we never thought you'd be the criminal.

324
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,420
But it was so convincing.

325
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,030
Yes. She's the least suspicious of us.

326
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,310
Therefore she becomes suspicious.

327
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,440
Yeah, yeah.

328
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,840
That was a wonderful deduction.

329
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,330
I never thought you'd figure it out.

330
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,450
Yes, she's right.

331
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,840
I am the criminal.

332
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,010
No, that's wrong.

333
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,080
The criminal is not Hinagiku.

334
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,820
Hey, don't take my scene away!

335
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,210
You surprised me so much, the anesthesia burned out in me.

336
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,150
From the developments, only I can be the criminal.

337
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:44,050
But that would make this all too simple and boring.

338
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:48,580
Um, that's making it hard
to figure out who's speaking, so can you stop it?

339
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,490
You've all forgotten something!

340
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:56,210
There is one more very suspicious person!

341
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,620
One more person?

342
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,480
Yes! And that individual is...

343
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,090
That individual is?

344
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,560
The person doing the voice in the sky!

345
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,220
Me?

346
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,890
Milady, isn't that getting too absurd?

347
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,100
No, this is good.

348
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,140
But I don't think the viewers will accept it.

349
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,650
It's a suspense story produced and enacted by me.

350
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,110
I won't let anyone complain.

351
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,140
Hey!

352
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,440
A tidal wave!

353
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,020
Let's get out of here!

354
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,550
Hold it!

355
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,150
Onee-chan?

356
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:37,790
I can't take this! Why do I not get
to come out halfway into the show?!

357
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,510
You're a corpse, so stop coming back to life!

358
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,160
I can't possibly play dead forever!

359
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,950
You screwed up my script I wrote without sleep!

360
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,130
You leave me without a choice but to use my last resort!

361
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,310
Here comes the service time!

362
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,430
The best thing to do in autumn is to enjoy the hot spring while enjoying the foliage.

363
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,580
Really, it's so soothing.

364
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,340
All of you, too, hope you have a good ****** dreamy mood.

365
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,230
This is heaven.

366
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,470
Wh-Why is the men's bath so small?

367
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,470
Did you say something?

368
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,430
Don't move! It got pinched in!

369
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,490
What's pinched?

370
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,520
Don't move!

371
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,040
And so, Glutton Dreamy Mood.

372
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,230
It was a twenty-minute long special.

373
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,490
Next time, we'll fight against siblings.

374
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,940
Right, I forgot about you.

375
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,800
We don't have much time left.

376
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,170
Come, Mysterious Dark Butler Two!

377
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,480
Defeat the butler Ayasaki Hayate and bring him to us!

378
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,490
Bring him to us!

379
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,470
Go!

380
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,570
B-Fire!

381
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,530
Take this.

382
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,760
This is...

383
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,100
B-Fire!

384
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,300
Go! Hayate Blaster!

385
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,350
You better remember this!

386
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,820
Come whenever you like, Mysterious Butlers!

387
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,460
Oh. What the heck am I doing...

388
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,020
Nagi and...

389
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,190
Hayate's...

390
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,960
Butler Network!

391
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,370
Whee! Bounce! Bounce! This is Sanzenin Nagi.

392
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,610
This is Ayasaki Hayate.

393
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,500
I'm your idol, Katsura Yukiji.

394
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,530
Katsura-sensei, what are you here for?

395
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,410
Aren't you kind, Ayasaki-kun?

396
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:47,610
But forget that! When the heck
is my character song going to be finished?

397
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:50,710
We can't expect many sales from you.

398
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,140
Yes. It might be best to duo with Tama.

399
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,250
Ayasaki-kun, you can talk big now, huh?

400
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,020
Next week's guest will be the Hamster!

401
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,270
See you!

402
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,620
So you used to call Sakuya-san
"Saku-neechan" when you were little, Milady?

403
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,790
It's a horrid past.

404
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:11,050
Nagi never took care of little kids,
so she's a brat no matter how much she grows.

405
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:11,990
Don't make fun of me.

406
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:16,500
If I had younger siblings, then I could take care of them better than Saku.

407
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,440
Are you sure? Then prove it.

408
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,300
You got it.

409
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,670
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

410
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,620
Do You Like Rich, Pretty Ladies?

411
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,930
Did you know? Of the Wright brothers,
Orville, the younger brother, is the first one that flew.
