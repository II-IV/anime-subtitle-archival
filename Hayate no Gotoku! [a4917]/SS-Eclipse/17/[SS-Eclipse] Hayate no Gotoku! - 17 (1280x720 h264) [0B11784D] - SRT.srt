1
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:09,350
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:09,990
Got it?

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,740
~Jyararan

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,490
SFX: Splash

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,060
~Splash~

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,360
My name is Brittney.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,650
As you can see, I'm just a flower girl.

8
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,530
SFX: Splash

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,280
Today, I've come all the way to the Sea of Japan, drawn by the fragrance of flowers.

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:30,670
Listening to the waves reminds me of my magical homeland,
Third District of East Nakano.

11
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,250
Shoot me. I just spoke my secret.

12
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,650
You may have noticed now, but my true identity is...

13
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,180
A magical girl!

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:47,210
Today, as the seventeenth episode anniversary,
we'll show you my manga for the entire thirty minutes.

15
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,680
It's an amazing slide show anime that surpasses the level of Kaya**** and Nekome**.

16
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,400
The talent that overwhelms
the Ultra Director of the SO* Brigade.

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,870
Please stop! The audience's going think that we're quitting on them.

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,790
Besides, what do we celebrate at the seventeenth episode?

19
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,150
Don't make fun of episode number seventeen!

20
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,880
In episode seventeen, A**ro steals a ***dam and leaves the ***** Base!

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,590
Even Captain O**** collapses and gets carried into-

22
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,980
A-Anyway, as always, please enjoy Hayate no Gotoku.

23
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,520
A butler is one who serves.

24
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,750
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

25
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,880
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

26
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:27,960
Yes.

27
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:35,810
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

28
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,690
By the way, there's a Say** fan service shot.

29
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,200
That happens in episode 37!

30
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,650
Episode 17 is Mi***-san.

31
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,440
The girl knows for a fact...

32
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,880
...there are things in this world that cannot be bought even with money.

33
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,200
SFX: BANG

34
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,190
Come to your own conclusion as to what happened.

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,870
What's wrong, Milady?!

36
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,600
This is...

37
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,920
Manga magazine?

38
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,640
I apparently don't have enough experience in life.

39
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,780
The reason I can't win anything from the manga I draw is because I don't have enough experience in life.

40
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,570
Wh-What do you think? It's my masterpiece.

41
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,320
It's strange that that doesn't make it into the final selection.

42
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,830
I guess an unreasonable joke like this can happen.

43
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,200
It's not a matter of jokes!

44
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,680
Can't you feel the grand scale of this work?!

45
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,670
I can definitely feel how wicked this is.

46
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:25,310
It's all because of the lame selection committee that capable new faces die out.

47
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,940
"To create an interesting manga, one must have a rich life."

48
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,390
SFX: Snap

49
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,270
Vague advice like that won't let newcomers improve!

50
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,090
Don't tell me that.

51
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,030
Well, that is like her innate illness, so do not worry about it.

52
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,560
She draws a manga every few months and sends it in.

53
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,320
I see.

54
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,040
What's wrong?

55
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:58,610
Just thinking that Milady can work hard if it's on something she likes.

56
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,650
Although she is not close to getting accepted.

57
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,970
Yes...

58
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,620
I feel bad for her a little.

59
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,920
You shouldn't.

60
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:14,600
It is an opportunity for her to learn there are things you cannot do anything about with money, so I think it is good.

61
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,930
True, I think I don't have enough experience in life.

62
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,030
I don't have many friends, don't go to school often,
and don't participate in any sports.

63
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,600
And I'm not active at home;
I can get away every day without doing anything.

64
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,050
Walking down Loser Avenue.

65
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,500
It's because of this blessed life I have!

66
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,130
It's because I lack the experience of being in the depths of poverty like Nero and Maruko.

67
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:44,070
Nor have I ever been dropped from
the pinnacle of happiness like Se***.

68
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,790
That's why I can't create a story that brings the entire US to tears.

69
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,770
Wait! There's someone who's really acquainted with that kind of life!

70
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:00,200
What? What I was doing when I was about thirteen years old?

71
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:05,470
Yes! I want to know how much of a difference there is
between you and I with respect to our life experiences!

72
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,490
Back when I was thirteen, eh?

73
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:13,440
Let's see, if I'm right, I was working as a Daiuchi at a mah-jong house.

74
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:13,820
Huh?

75
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,200
Daiuchi...

76
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:24,650
It's an occupation akin to a bodyguard specialized in dealing with the very kind people that come for mah-jong.

77
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:28,430
SFX: Rustle...

78
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,870
It's a dangerous occupation that doesn't allow you to lose.

79
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,740
Isn't that really dangerous?

80
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:36,870
I was fine. I'm really good,
and I was good at playing things under the table, too.

81
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,810
Looks like the difference in life experience is big.

82
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,720
But I think you have plenty of experience in life, too.

83
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,910
You're in high school when you're only thirteen years old.

84
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,490
And living in a big mansion like this.

85
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,320
One can't have this kind of experience very often.

86
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,710
Y-You think so?

87
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,700
By the way, what else did you do?

88
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,150
Let's see...

89
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:03,890
I was also winning prizes via submitting manga.

90
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,210
Looks like the lack of experience is  the difference in skill.

91
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,670
Milady?

92
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,640
Then I'll do things I usually don't do and gain experience points!

93
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,210
Gain experience points from doing things you don't usually do?

94
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,550
That's the spirit, Milady!

95
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,990
Let's take the opportunity and jump out into the outside world!

96
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,710
Never!

97
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,830
Things outside of the wall are equivalent of experience from Sli***.

98
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,900
I'm looking for experience equivalent to the Lost Me*** series!

99
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,070
Therefore, by picking the thing I would never do...

100
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,700
I'll help out Maria!

101
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,040
What? Help?

102
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,920
Yes! I'll make myself useful.

103
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,350
Tell me to do anything.

104
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,650
Hayate-kun...

105
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,720
Well, since she's motivated for it...

106
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,590
To start out with, I'll start with housekeeping like Maria is always doing.

107
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,040
Wait, Nagi!

108
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,300
Here goes! Zep****th Broom!

109
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,230
That's not a chant for housekeeping.

110
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,830
Y-Yeah, little oopsie.

111
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,110
But I'll do it right next time.

112
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,860
Hayate-kun...

113
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,350
Milady! Wait! Stop!

114
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,090
Hayate. There indeed are things you can never learn without experiencing.

115
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,810
Like what?

116
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,600
Housekeeping makes things messy.

117
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,910
What a very expensive experience.

118
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,360
I've now mastered housekeeping.

119
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,610
Let's move on.

120
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,030
Wait, Milady!

121
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,840
Next, I'll master shopping.

122
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,280
Shopping?

123
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:49,140
But there are things you can't buy from internet shopping for Ya*** Auctions.

124
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,040
Stop making fun of me.

125
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,610
I'm going outside to do grocery shopping.

126
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,690
Th-There are way too many things.

127
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,100
It's the largest market around here.

128
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,960
If RPG item shops were like this, you could't tell what to buy!

129
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,510
First of all, you check the price and how fresh it is.

130
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,290
And the place it was made,
and if you can, the person who made it, too.

131
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,500
I don't need a complicated command like that.

132
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,090
Hey, staff.

133
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:20,970
Yes?

134
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,350
I've gained yet another experience.

135
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,880
What is it this time?

136
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,250
If you go grocery shopping, a shop will disappear.

137
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,350
It's news to me, too.

138
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,470
Okay, next up is cleaning out the shed!

139
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,320
You're doing more?

140
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,400
Wow, you might find legendary items here.

141
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:50,030
Things in here are all practically junk.

142
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:53,880
No, I'm sure they're all priceless works of art.

143
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,340
Th-This is!

144
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,120
I can't imagine a portrait like this could be worth anything.

145
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,500
You're right.

146
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,930
SFX: KATSU

147
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,920
Katsu!

148
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,560
Who's there?!

149
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,330
That's Rodin's The Thinker.

150
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,600
What? Chief Butler? What are you doing here?

151
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,560
This is my relaxation spot.

152
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,370
When I don't have screen time,
I indulge in art in order to rejuvenate myself.

153
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,910
No wonder I didn't see you around.

154
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,420
We're moving on!

155
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,270
Please wait, Milady!

156
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:43,210
Milady! Please let me out of here!

157
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,060
It's dark! It's scary!

158
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,890
Neko ga nekoronda

159
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,890
Neko ga nekoronda = The cat took a nap

160
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,830
Daffunda. Daijyobuda.

161
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,830
Gags by Shimura Ken

162
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,320
So Hayate, what should I do next?

163
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,820
Let's see...

164
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,570
I guess serving guests is all that's left.

165
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,040
Serving guests. Gotcha!

166
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,040
Milady!

167
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,750
Please wait. No customers are here right now.

168
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,820
Isumi-san?

169
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,680
Isumi!

170
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,330
Nagi. Hayate-sama.

171
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,990
What are you doing here?

172
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,670
So this was your house.

173
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,920
No wonder the scenery looked familiar.

174
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,170
You see, I was studying in my room until a while ago, but...

175
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,910
My eraser dropped off of my table.

176
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,300
Wait.

177
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,950
And while I was searching the yard...

178
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,680
Before I knew it, I got lost here.

179
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,730
Your way of getting lost is overflowing with originality as always.

180
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,680
Maybe your yard and mine are connected by a wormhole.

181
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,730
But you came here with perfect timing.

182
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:05,100
I will give you VIP service.

183
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,230
Will Milady be fine?

184
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,020
Did you make the tea for me?

185
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,020
Yes. I mixed every kind of expensive tea leaves
there were in the kitchen,

186
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:20,890
and made Sanzenin Nagi Original Royal Premium Hyper Giga-Max Blend, so it's really good.

187
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,520
Ah! The cup's dirty!

188
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,440
Let me go get a new one for you.

189
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,580
Hayate?

190
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,560
A blend of Darjeeling, blue mountain, and genmai tea.

191
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,580
And for some reason, I can taste Ba** Star Ramen, too.

192
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,710
I can't possibly serve an Oh My ***bu tea like this.

193
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,950
H-How is it?

194
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,060
It's delicious, Nagi.

195
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,020
Is it?

196
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,610
Look Hayate! Seems like I have a talent for serving others!

197
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,520
I'm happy for you, Milady.

198
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,200
All right, I'll serve more people and gain more experience!

199
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,200
Please enjoy.

200
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,360
Thank you.

201
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,000
¥1,000 for omelet with a word.

202
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,930
If I eat this, will I be considered a rich girl, too?

203
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,830
Whee.

204
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,960
Thanks for coming, everyone!

205
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,570
Nagi?

206
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,710
What's with her getup?

207
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,710
It's the worst choice of cosplay.

208
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,460
It's not a cosplay.

209
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,440
It's gaining experience in life.

210
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,150
Huh?

211
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,050
Hey, what's with this gaining experience in life?

212
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:03,860
She said she wants to do things she usually doesn't do to gain experience.

213
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,070
I will now show you my talent in serving guests.

214
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:13,370
I'll make a dish that's so good that it'll melt your cheek and hit the core of Earth.

215
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,180
What? You're going to start making it now?

216
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,470
Here I go!

217
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,230
Hey, is this really going to be fine?

218
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,140
I'm sorry, I'll go see.

219
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,890
Sneaking around~

220
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,830
So gross!

221
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,890
If we serve this to the guests, the reaction will hurt Milady.

222
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,670
I can't let this be.

223
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,450
I-It's good!

224
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,830
This is actually good!

225
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,210
You're right.

226
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,120
What a deep taste composed of a fusion between heavy and light seasoning.

227
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,470
A mellow taste as if spring is here.

228
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,620
A velvety feel on the tongue as if it's an embrace by the great ocean.

229
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,930
The ingredients are going through a nuclear reaction in the mouth,

230
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:18,130
and a Big Bang flavor explodes!

231
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,230
T-This is...

232
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,170
This is magnificent.

233
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,920
It's wondafo~

234
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,640
It's exquisite!

235
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,220
It's exquisite!

236
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,710
It's delicious.

237
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,420
Come on, come on, come on!

238
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,230
Bring me seconds!

239
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,410
Katsura-chan, you can't go wild here.

240
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,150
Bring me more booze!

241
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,600
Bring me more food!

242
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,400
And bring me money while you're at it!

243
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,980
Hayate. Everyone likes my cooking.

244
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,880
I'm happy for you, Milady.

245
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,880
Thanks for the food, Hayate-kun.

246
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,820
You're the one that made all of this, right?

247
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,940
Looks like I was right.

248
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,560
It's so easy to read your face.

249
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,430
Please don't tell Milady.

250
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,430
I know.

251
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,130
It's not easy being a butler, heh?

252
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,760
All the work you do to not cause your master shame.

253
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,370
It was delicious, Nagi-chan.

254
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,960
The service was well done, too.

255
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,600
Really?

256
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,140
I'm glad I came.

257
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,720
Hey, Hayate.

258
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,710
Yes?

259
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,560
I think I understand some of what you and Maria feel, even if just a bit.

260
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,630
Doing something for others feels good.

261
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:10,040
I want many people to enjoy the manga I draw, too,
like they enjoyed today's evening.

262
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,290
Milady.

263
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,730
Milady is a good girl at heart.

264
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,790
I need to keep protecting her kind heart.

265
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,440
Where're my seconds?

266
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,270
If you don't bring more, I'll give you my jumping knee.

267
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,100
Katsura-sensei, you haven't gone home?

268
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,000
This smell!

269
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,400
Yay!

270
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,440
Found my seconds!

271
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,310
And I went through the trouble of hiding it.

272
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,650
Katsura-sensei?

273
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,370
Sensei! Come back!

274
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,270
Hayate...

275
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,280
Milady.

276
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,840
Why is the food I made sitting here untouched?

277
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,780
Wh-What are you talking about?

278
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:12,640
Everyone cleared your food few minutes ago.

279
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,610
This is a mess I made.

280
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,220
Don't lie to me!

281
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,440
Then explain the signature there!

282
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:24,070
You don't have to sign it like a manga character.

283
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,390
So the food everyone ate was your cooking, wasn't it?

284
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,920
Um, well...

285
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:36,420
I see... Perhaps, I wasn't of any help?

286
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:41,470
I wasn't of any help to you and Maria from the start?

287
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,720
That's absolutely not true!

288
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,770
How should I put it...

289
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:48,240
Everyone has things they're good and things they're not good at.

290
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,380
So in other words...

291
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,400
You want to say I might not have what it takes to create manga?

292
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,180
I never said that.

293
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,580
It's not like it never crossed my mind.

294
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:06,720
I thought of it once on a very rare, limited moon.

295
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:13,630
That the reason why I can't win any prizes is because I don't have any talent.

296
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,600
Milady...

297
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,870
Milady!

298
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,640
I'm...

299
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,570
I'm...

300
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,410
Milady!

301
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,780
Are you all right, Milady?

302
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,490
Leave me alone.

303
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,060
I don't have any talent...

304
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,260
I can't help out at all...

305
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,350
It's all right.

306
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,780
Look at that.

307
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:45,540
Because you helped, they both look so happy.

308
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,070
SFX: Dumbstruck~

309
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,660
Their eyes look dead.

310
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,070
How do we clean this?

311
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,300
There goes my screen time.

312
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,400
You think I don't have talent, either, don't you?

313
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,640
So you do!

314
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:05,020
Even in your eyes that once received manga prizes,
I appear to not have any talent, huh?!

315
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,250
You do have talent.

316
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:14,310
You've created many manga and kept submitting, right?

317
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:20,680
There are many people who can't even finish one story and give up.

318
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:25,440
But if it's something you like, you can work till the very end without giving up,

319
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,410
you have the talent called passion,

320
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,180
The talent called passion?

321
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,130
Yes.

322
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,640
I give you my word.

323
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,450
You got it, Hayate!

324
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,200
I'll give it a shot with my passion!

325
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,330
That's the spirit, Milady.

326
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:46,730
Besides, it could be that your manga is too high level.

327
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,410
Too high?

328
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:54,280
Yes. Like, you in fact have too much experience, therefore the humor is hard to transcend.

329
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,700
I see! Then if I drop the level down a little-

330
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,010
Yes. I'm sure you'll get the next prize.

331
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,500
Okay! Then I'll give it another shot!

332
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,810
Good luck, Milady!

333
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,140
Black Se** **turn?!

334
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,820
That's the trump card for saving the 8-dimensional Earth.

335
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,280
All that's left is winning the music competition.

336
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,660
The tool needed to communicate with the Fourth Space God for the mentioned task is already in hand through Ya*** Auction.

337
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,140
The level's way up there as usual.

338
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,830
The next rookie prize is mine.

339
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,500
Y-Yes.

340
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,400
Therefore, the debt-ridden butler's
life experiences and suffering continue.

341
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,210
Next week, the dragon and hamster go head to head!

342
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,650
But, unfortunately, due to scheduling issues,
it'll be a swimsuit episode.

343
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,540
Can't wait for the next one.

344
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,520
You're amazing, Nagi.

345
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,480
My back pain's gone.

346
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,040
Nagi and...

347
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,690
Hayate's...

348
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,780
Butler Network!

349
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,430
Hello. I'm Katsura Yukiji.

350
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,790
Katsura-sensei. What are you here for?

351
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:43,770
I thought, since I have a more mature appeal than Hinagiku, everyone would like that more.

352
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,430
I wonder about that.

353
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:49,000
Besides, boys and girls who like Hinagiku won't be buying the DVD!

354
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,420
We should appeal to single males over twenty years old.

355
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,110
Katsura-sensei, no commercials in the show, please.

356
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,370
You're too naive. I only want people to buy the Hayate no Gotoku DVD.

357
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:57,160
AHHHH!!!

358
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,780
Don't panic, Ayasaki-kun.

359
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,070
Hey, Onee-chan!

360
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:04,400
Next week, it's the episode you've all been waiting for,
the summer swimsuit episode!

361
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,760
What did everyone see at the tropical Hakuou Island?

362
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,900
Welcome to Hakuou Island.

363
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,800
I'm the butler and the manager of this island, Schmidt hen Bach.

364
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,860
I will be creating your fun summer memories.

365
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,480
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

366
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,740
The Rare Card is Swimsuit.

367
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,740
I'm talking more than usual.

368
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,250
Now, how do I fight this?
