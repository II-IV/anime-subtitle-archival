1
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,440
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,020
Got it?

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,420
It was a Christmas present!

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,640
Thanks to a very common high school boy's, Ayasaki Hayate's, generous parents,

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,850
he was kindly given to very nice people.

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:27,360
However, destiny was waiting for him at the park.

7
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,140
I'm not really sure, but you saved me.

8
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,970
Villains! Hand her back to me now!

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,060
So I'll make him my, Sanzenin Nagi's, new butler!

10
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,310
A butler is one who serves.

11
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,030
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

12
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:58,170
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,440
Yes.

14
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:08,110
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

15
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,410
So I'll make him my, Sanzenin Nagi's, new butler!

16
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,180
Why are you stating it twice?

17
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,250
Hey, where am I?

18
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,910
Are you set?

19
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,690
Are you done with your life?

20
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,820
Oh please, Mr. Santa Claus.

21
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,300
You sound as though I'm dead.

22
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,470
You are dead.

23
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:11,410
You were so red that we couldn't even put you on the airwaves.

24
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,140
I see.

25
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,780
But if so, oh well.

26
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,230
I don't have any family to grieve over me, or a house to return to.

27
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,290
Really?

28
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,820
A kidnapper trying to act as a tragic hero?

29
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,470
Besides in the last episode, although it was in your mind, you did punch me.

30
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:41,530
Don't forget. Although it didn't actually happen,
what you tried to do is a crime.

31
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,190
I-I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'll never do it again.

32
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,380
I'm really sorry.

33
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,080
I'm... sorry...

34
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,080
Hey, where am I?

35
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,450
This splendor... it can't be of this world.

36
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,750
Which means, this is Heaven.

37
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:15,450
If not, it has to be an illusion created by my mind due to a long, poor life.

38
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,520
Thank you, Mr. Santa Claus. I'll enjoy it to my fullest.

39
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,540
What a stupid hero we have.

40
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:28,340
He did hit his head hard, but there's nothing to worry about.

41
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,220
He must have been training regularly.

42
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,550
If anything comes up, call me.

43
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:43,300
Maria. I want to make him Himegami's replacement.

44
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,200
Um, I'm having a hard time following you.

45
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,460
It's true that it's the person who saved my life's wish, but...

46
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,450
How do I say...

47
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,760
He confessed love to me at the park.

48
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,670
Very passionately.

49
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,430
"I want to take you away" or something like that.

50
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,820
I see...

51
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,080
Anyway, when Hayate wakes up, let me know right away.

52
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,780
I'm leaving it to you.

53
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,200
What is going on? I have to check on a few things.

54
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,590
Oh, but before that.

55
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,780
Wow, my dream's awesome.

56
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,230
It's more flamboyant than anything I'd ever seen when I was alive.

57
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:26,640
Man, but if this is Heaven, it's not such a bad idea to die.

58
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,810
The alone part is a little lonely, though.

59
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,520
I-It does feel good, doesn't it?

60
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,560
I-It really calms me down.

61
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,990
Don't be!

62
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,070
Is this really a dream? Wh-Why is that scarf person here?

63
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,110
Um...

64
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,960
Y-Yes?

65
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,530
Your body is really quite tough.

66
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,370
Although your life isn't in any danger, to take a bath...

67
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,750
The wounds would open for any normal person.

68
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,640
And the bath is now stained.

69
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,900
It's stained by the red bath agent that oozed out of Hayate!

70
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,650
Get a hold of yourself! Are you all right?

71
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,860
Hey! A shooting star!

72
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:23,410
No wait, we're not even at the halfway point of the episode!

73
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,830
Here's a fan service shot to make up for it!

74
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,390
Are you awake, Ayasaki Hayate-kun?

75
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,820
You were in the bath-

76
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,230
You've been out all this time, ever since you were carried into the mansion, but are you all right?

77
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,370
I've been out all this time?

78
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,460
Of course!

79
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,050
You've been out the entire time.

80
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,820
I see. So that was a dream.

81
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,220
Oh, but how do you know my name?

82
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,060
And, where am I?

83
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,910
Let's see...

84
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,970
This is Lady Sanzenin Nagi-sama's mansion, whom you saved.

85
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,790
I saved...

86
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,800
That girl's?!

87
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,340
And I am her maid, Maria.

88
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,830
And, though I know it's impolite of me, I took a look at this.

89
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,620
It seems you are in a difficult position.

90
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,670
N-No, nothing much.

91
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:31,290
By the way, I have something I want to ask you.

92
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,660
Regarding what happened with our Lady in the park.

93
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,830
E-Everything's exposed?

94
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,750
I'm told that you were going to "take her away"?

95
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,310
Ummm...

96
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,730
I-I'm sorry! I'll never even think about kidnapping!

97
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,910
I see. I understand your situation.

98
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,290
I really don't know how to apologize regarding this matter.

99
00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:00,070
Well, there are lies that people say out of necessity.

100
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,900
Oh, so you were awake already.

101
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,750
How are you feeling?

102
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,480
I'm fine now.

103
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,000
Thank you so much for being so kind to me.

104
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,990
But I'm sorry for the terrible request I made to you at the park.

105
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,480
For ¥156,804,000, too.

106
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,260
Well, it surprised me, but I wasn't against it.

107
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,550
It was your first moment being confessed to, after all.

108
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,560
Although you mistook it.

109
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,470
But we don't know each other well,
so I'm not too sure about rushing the steps.

110
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,570
I-I've given it some thought after that, too!

111
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,330
You were looking for live-in work, weren't you?

112
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,280
Then be my butler here at the mansion.

113
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,320
Oh, yay.

114
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,570
Butler?

115
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:53,900
U-Um, Milady, how about asking his situation first?

116
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,630
But we do need a replacement for Himegami.

117
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,460
Besides, your toughness is greater than anyone's.

118
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,860
He was moving even after getting hit by a car.

119
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,460
She's about to forgive me for trying to kidnap her and is now offering me live-in work?

120
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,520
What a... What a kind little girl!

121
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,370
Thank you, Mr. Santa Claus.

122
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:17,020
This must be my first present from you.

123
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,100
No, not necessarily.

124
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,390
B-But Hayate-kun doesn't know what a butler does, does he?

125
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,440
I'll do it!

126
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,140
Leave it to me, Milady.

127
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:31,150
No matter what happens, I, Ayasaki Hayate,
will protect Milady, even at the cost of my own life!

128
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,360
Y-You idiot!

129
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,400
Don't say such an embarrassing thing in front of Maria.

130
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:45,100
W-What should we do about these two naturally empty minds?

131
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,040
What is this?

132
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,540
A new butler?

133
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:55,820
Yes, we were looking for a replacement
to fill in for head butler with Himegami gone,

134
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,600
but what exactly is this Ayasaki Hayate boy like?

135
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,050
Let's see...

136
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:10,020
Someone who can catch up to a car speeding at 120km/h
on a bicycle and can withstand being run over by said car.

137
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,590
Maria, which ***dam is that?

138
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,710
That's as sturdy as a giant robot.

139
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,970
No, Klaus-san, he is a human.

140
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,340
And, that ***dam is not a giant robot, but-

141
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,940
I-I see, so that ***dam isn't a giant robot?

142
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:29,230
I'm studying anime to have
a common interest with Milady, but...

143
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,900
"Foolishness caused by youth."

144
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,520
You seem to be understanding it.

145
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,350
So regarding Hayate-kun's case?

146
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,920
Anyways, the likes of him won't suffice as our butler.

147
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,210
Have him leave.

148
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,030
But...

149
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,260
Okay?

150
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,500
Wow.

151
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,000
How's the fit?

152
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,900
Yes, it's perfect.

153
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,310
That's great. It was worth fixing it last night.

154
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,110
Maria-san, you did this?

155
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,980
Shall we get to work now?

156
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,180
Yes.

157
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:10,450
So, what exactly is my job?

158
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,900
Let's see...

159
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,150
Since it's the end of the year, I guess cleaning every spot you see.

160
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:21,810
Klaus-san said to send him out, but I cannot really do that, can I?

161
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,550
Cleaning... Then I can do that, too.

162
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,980
If I get fired from here, I can't pay the ¥156,804,000 back.

163
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,460
I won't have a place to live, either.

164
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,520
Yes, today, my new life will start here!

165
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,630
Yes, as a butler to the Sanzenin family.

166
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,700
Don't take my line.

167
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,880
Time for commercials.

168
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,680
Love.

169
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,920
Hate.

170
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:57,700
Yes, today, my new life will start here!

171
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,840
As a butler to the Sanzenin family!

172
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,730
I got to say it all this time!

173
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,220
Ah, Nagi. Good morning.

174
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,190
Ah, good morning, both of you.

175
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,810
Look at this, Milady.

176
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,450
Maria-san redid these clothes for me.

177
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,550
Well, I hope you work well.

178
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,010
I-I feel she's become cold all of a sudden.

179
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,880
If you ask me, I think she's getting heated up.

180
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,910
Anyway, I'll gain her trust back through work!

181
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,700
U-Um-

182
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,630
His motivation... How can I send him away?

183
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:41,310
And how can I untangle the misunderstanding?

184
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,010
That wasn't the right attitude to take.

185
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:50,210
That was way too mean.

186
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,550
If I could sew like Maria...

187
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,920
What do you think, Hayate?

188
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,980
It's amazing, Milady.

189
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,210
Hayate.

190
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,190
Milady.

191
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,190
Milady.

192
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,690
Milady!

193
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,970
Oh, Maria. Where's Hayate?

194
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,220
He's helping me with cleaning.

195
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,010
He's filled with motivation.

196
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,080
I see.

197
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,290
Apparently, he is going to work hard to gain your trust.

198
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:24,980
If you have anything in mind,
I think it is the best if you talk to him in person.

199
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,330
Y-You're right! We have to get to know each other well, first.

200
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:29,960
Yes.

201
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,560
I'll get to where Hayate is!

202
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,510
Make sure you kindly untangle the misunderstanding.

203
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,940
Maria-san, could you check the cleaning for me?

204
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,400
Huh? Is something wrong?

205
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,810
No, just thinking how unsynchronized you two are.

206
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,260
It looks really clean here.

207
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,350
Does it? Thank you very much.

208
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,690
Very thorough in the smallest places.

209
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,510
That's...

210
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:11,740
Ah, that door handle was made of silver, so I used Silver Duster to polish it.

211
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,280
This statue here, after taking the stain off with a brush made of brass, I cleaned with a neutral detergent.

212
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,750
Then I wiped the water off and finished it with a wax coating.

213
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:26,170
The carpet was Kilim style made with wool,
so I used cosmetic detergent with cold water.

214
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,080
Um, did I do something wrong?

215
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,640
No, I'm honestly surprised.

216
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,690
Rather, I'm at a loss for words.

217
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:39,490
Well, I was working at a sanitation company when I was eight, while hiding my age, to get money for my parents to drink off.

218
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,810
So cleaning turns out to be one of my specialties.

219
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm sorry, Klaus-san, I can't find a reason to send Hayate-kun off.

220
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,220
It looks like Nagi's eye for selecting people seems to be true.

221
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,680
But this mansion is really huge.

222
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,980
How many rooms are there to clean?

223
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,680
Study?

224
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:13,160
I don't sense anyone in here.

225
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,920
What is this?

226
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,630
Milady's notebook?

227
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,220
Th-This is!

228
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,510
A picture diary?

229
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,830
It's a manga.

230
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,170
N-No, I mustn't look at a private thing like this.

231
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:34,870
Hey!

232
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,500
What are you looking at in someone else's room?

233
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,940
M-Milady! Um, this is...

234
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,980
Th-That's my-

235
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,230
No, I didn't read your picture diary at all!

236
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,460
P-P-Picture diary, you say?

237
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,400
You idiot!!!

238
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,710
Milady?

239
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,340
Shut up! I don't care about you anymore!

240
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,170
What do you understand about me?!

241
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,770
Idiot! Hayate, you idiot!

242
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,230
Milady...

243
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,250
Get out of here!

244
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,020
Farewell, my peace.

245
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,750
It was short, but thank you.

246
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:26,920
We meet again, kiddo.

247
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,930
Hello...

248
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,360
Are you sure?

249
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,080
Sure about what?

250
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,120
Hayate-kun really left.

251
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,200
On a black pumpkin carriage, too.

252
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,590
Wh-What?

253
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,640
H-Hey! The second half of this episode isn't over yet!

254
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,060
Indeed.

255
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,430
Are you sure you want to leave him?

256
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,700
I only told him to get out of the room.

257
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,570
I didn't think he'd leave the mansion.

258
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:13,380
It is because you are not in the habit of putting away your important things.

259
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,450
Not much we can do now.

260
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,850
Let us forget about Hayate-kun.

261
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:22,830
If you say you are through with him, then there is no reason to stop him.

262
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,160
But that's...

263
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:28,430
If you hate Hayate-kun, then it is better to leave things as is.

264
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,440
No, I don't hate him or anything.

265
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,350
You don't?

266
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,840
In any case, Hayate is the person who saved my life.

267
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:40,370
As a part of Sanzenin, I can't abandon my savior.

268
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:49,810
Um, Mister Nice People, where is this?

269
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,120
The Immigration Office.

270
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:56,450
Oh, I'm so happy. Volunteer work is waiting for me ahead.

271
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,440
I'm never going to return to Japan.

272
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,690
I probably won't be able to come back.

273
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,400
Wh-What should I do? At this rate, my life will...

274
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,660
First, it'll be a cruise with everyone on a gorgeous boat.

275
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,000
But on the way, pirates will attack us,

276
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,110
and for some reason I'll get recruited into their crew.

277
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:17,460
After becoming a wanted man,
I get cornered by an ocean monkey,

278
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,770
and my dream to become the Pirate King sinks into a cross-shaped ocean.

279
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,260
Um, I have a little emergency to attend to.

280
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,110
Let me go!

281
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:33,470
Don't worry. Your luxury boat is ready, too.

282
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,900
S-Someone help!

283
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,320
Bro!

284
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,790
It hurts!

285
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,440
Bro, stop moving.

286
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,370
Want me to help?

287
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,990
Please stay still!

288
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,140
That voice. Could you be...

289
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,740
Milad-

290
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,910
NO!!!

291
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,660
My name is Na-

292
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,050
No, um...

293
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,070
Mask...

294
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,930
Right, Mask the Money!

295
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,760
I came here at the request of Nagi.

296
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,760
And, here's a message from her.

297
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:16,440
"I-I'm sorry for yelling at you earlier."

298
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,250
That's what she wanted me to tell you!

299
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,990
A-And, what you saw in the notebook is her latest work,

300
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:32,430
a manga titled Millennium Legend: Magical Destroy,

301
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,670
and it absolutely wasn't a picture diary!

302
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,920
Okay, I got it!

303
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,540
Ah, Mask the Money-san!

304
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:43,930
Good. Then continue being a butler at her house.

305
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,440
She'd be happy that way.

306
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,670
I think...

307
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,090
Yes!

308
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,650
Of course, you're not going to be able to do that.

309
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:56,580
He's got a ¥156,804,000 debt made by his parents to pay back.

310
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,400
He's got to return it in full.

311
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,260
Are you talking about this?

312
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,240
So what about this piece of paper?

313
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,750
I told you to shut up, or did you not hear me, baldy?!

314
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,320
This brat...

315
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,290
D-Don't touch this person!

316
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,580
Don't be so arrogant.

317
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:25,780
If you don't want us to touch her,
then pay the ¥156,804,000 back right now.

318
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,900
I will.

319
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,390
The entire debt.

320
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,930
You're kidding...

321
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,440
That's all real money?

322
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,260
Of course, you idiots!

323
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,040
You don't have any more problems now, do you?

324
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,490
Bro.

325
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,160
Okay, let's get out of here.

326
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,330
Now you need to get the money back from him.

327
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,160
Mask the Money-san.

328
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,480
When you see Milady, please relay a message for me.

329
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,950
I will pay the money back with work.

330
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,570
And thank you for my position as butler.

331
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,620
But she meant the money as a gift to you.

332
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,450
N-No! I have to pay it off! Otherwise I can't be even with her.

333
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,620
After all, she came to save me with such a funny looking mask.

334
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,850
I don't even have to note that she thought it was cool.

335
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:27,870
So that money-

336
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,660
Pay it off!!!

337
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,710
On second thought, money-related matters must be kept black and white for the sake of justice.

338
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:41,450
So you must work like a horse to pay everything back to Sanzenin Nagi!

339
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,370
Y-Yes, of course.

340
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,390
I'm definitely, DEFINITELY, not going to give you any discounts, you hear?!

341
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,710
Hmph!

342
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,160
Mask the Money-san, your mask fell off.

343
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,040
W-W-W-W-What?!

344
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:57,350
Looks like they're fighting.

345
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,660
D-D-Don't look!

346
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,860
I think it's fine.

347
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,860
Not yet!

348
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,450
Yes, I understand!

349
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,980
They are like brother and sister.

350
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,630
You understand?!

351
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,130
Are you sure you didn't see?

352
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:04,800
I'm sorry.

353
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:04,800
Got that?!

354
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,460
It's snowing.

355
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:13,570
And this is how the two's Christmas came to an end.

356
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,630
However, spring is still far away.

357
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,930
One trouble after another.

358
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:24,570
Next week, we'll pit the mascot character of this anime and 21st-century household machines in a fight.

359
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:07,770
I'm absolutely against hiring a boy who's so pathetic and looks like he'll never have any luck with money for the rest of his life!

360
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,430
What?

361
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:14,120
If you see a problem with Hayate-kun's strength or potential, how about testing him?

362
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,670
A test?

363
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,940
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

364
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,910
The Beast, Robot, and Butler That Kinda Shout Love at the Center of the World.

365
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:25,290
Don't worry, Hayate; I know you can do it.

366
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:27,150
The red lion goes roar!
