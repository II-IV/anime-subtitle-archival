1
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,990
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,180
A Happy New Year!

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,110
The first thing of the year.

4
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:18,940
We'll start the...

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,590
Hayate no Gotoku's customary activity,

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,670
She means for the first time.

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,110
New Year's Hidden Trick Competition!

8
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,560
Shouldn't the host be Ma***aki?

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,870
The set was reused from Laugh! Big ****** Battle.

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,760
Here's the first skit.

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,670
The Red Team!

12
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,660
Live music of various instruments and a jump through a ring of fire!

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,290
It's hot! It's hot!

14
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,020
10 points, 10 points, 10 points, 10 points, and 10 points.

15
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,160
Followed by the White Team.

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,400
Standup comedy in various languages and a jump through a ring of fire.

17
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,350
I can't do this!

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,110
It's impossible!

19
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,200
You're being unreasonable!

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,030
I'll die from this!

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,690
10 points, 10 points, 10 points, 10 points, and 10 points.

22
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,220
A word of comment please, head judge.

23
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,340
It's idiotic.

24
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,980
Isn't there anything better on New Year's?

25
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,220
"Osechi is good, but eat ***** too," they say.

26
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,740
Oh, if I remember correctly, a new show starts today.

27
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,380
Really?

28
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,190
Hayate no Gotoku! Giant!

29
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,730
"Giant"? Is Hayate going to get big?

30
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,260
Then that'll make this show the same as an old show that made the hero a giant to counter the viewing rate.

31
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,260
Shut up!

32
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,360
Wow! Silver Mask!

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,760
Did you all know there's a huge mansion like this in the middle of Tokyo?

34
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,000
The name of the mistress who lives there is Sanzenin Nagi.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,740
And...

36
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,000
Her butler's name is Ayasaki Hayate.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,870
The two are slightly airheaded...

38
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,240
...and they misunderstand each other a bit...

39
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,120
...but they are bound by a tight master-butler bond.

40
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,740
Happy New Year's to you all.

41
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,820
Hayate no Gotoku Giant is starting.

42
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,420
Not!

43
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,050
It's New Year's Eve.

44
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,820
This year's finally coming to an end.

45
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,480
Would you like to go to a shrine for the first worship?

46
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,890
What? Stay home and read manga, play MMOs, and watch anime.

47
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,760
That's the Japanese style New Year's we proudly present to the world!

48
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,370
I guess so, in a way.

49
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,500
So you've regained your memory!

50
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:51,140
Oh right. I got sucked into Baltra Space and sent to Kujyuukuri.

51
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,610
Look, Dionimes. It's the dawn of mankind.

52
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,880
Now that you mention it, today's the New Year.

53
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,330
For the first sunrise seen with one's destined man to be the New Year's sunrise...

54
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,860
How romantic...

55
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,120
I guess it's not such a bad idea.

56
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,830
Songs speak to the world and the world speaks to songs.

57
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,970
This year is finally coming to an end.

58
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:17,050
A lot of things happened since coming to this mansion.

59
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:22,790
It's all thanks to Milady that I was able to spend the year alive, so I must be thankful to her.

60
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,780
If you say that so straightforwardly, it's embarrassing.

61
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,610
Milady! Where did you come from?!

62
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,290
Besides, what are you doing here?

63
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,000
Well, it's not such a big deal, but well...

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,900
I wanted to see the sunrise.

65
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,380
Note: "Asahi" means sunrise and is also
the name of a major newspaper in Japan

66
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,480
What? This show is by Shougakukan.

67
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,850
Note: Hayate has a relatively minor sports newspaper and seems interested in the UFO article.

68
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,850
Are you trying to sell out the show?

69
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,590
I see, I see. So is that head of yours what made you think of that stupid pun?

70
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,600
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,270
Gosh! You don't understand me!

72
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,740
I'm saying let's go view the first sunrise of the year at a beautiful beach!

73
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,130
Just you and me!

74
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,950
What? What's the point?

75
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,680
Shut up, you idiot!

76
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,290
Quit blabbing and get ready!

77
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,290
Y-Yes!

78
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,980
Um, we're going by bike?

79
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:15,070
Yeah. It's a secret from Klaus,
so we can't use a car or a helicopter.

80
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,210
Um, you mentioned a beach. Which one to be exact?

81
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,470
Kujyuukuri Beach.

82
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,570
What's wrong?

83
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:31,900
Um, the beach is 100km away, roughly speaking.

84
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,690
Wouldn't you  make it there in about an hour?

85
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,150
One hour would be a little...

86
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,800
Is it?

87
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,700
Oh well all we need to worry is making it there by sunrise, so let's take our time.

88
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,080
No, really. Wouldn't it be better to go with Maria-san and everyone else?

89
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,630
SFX: Ahaha~

90
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,590
Like using a car or helicopter, perhaps?

91
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,020
I said I want to go with you.

92
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,620
Or what, you don't want to be alone with me?

93
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,560
Absolutely not.

94
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:02,150
Tandem bicycle riding is a violation of traffic law, but Nerima Ward is pretty much entirely Sanzenin property, so it's not a problem.

95
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,530
What a convenient anime.

96
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,150
It's adult reasoning.

97
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,910
If you look back, it's hard to believe that I had a debt of 150 million yen dumped on me by my parents...

98
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:15,320
...and was almost sent to a resort island by very kind people.

99
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,190
Yeah, since it really was an unbelievable setting.

100
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,830
I-I guess.

101
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,560
But, we were able to meet thanks to that.

102
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,850
B-By the way, Hayate.

103
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,140
D-Does this bicycle come with a heater?

104
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,220
Huh?

105
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,340
My legs are starting to get cold.

106
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,570
I think you're asking for the impossible.

107
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:42,210
Your idea of going to the beach in the middle of the winter on a bicycle was a little reckless.

108
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,660
What? It's not reckless.

109
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,770
If I had instrumented a better skirt,
this project would have worked out.

110
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:53,090
Look at you. You'll catch a cold at this rate.

111
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:57,240
We have a long way ahead, so how about coming up with a new instrumentality project?

112
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,390
I guess you're right.

113
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:04,110
This is the legendary diamond pear card that exceeds the famous, non-limit black card.

114
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:09,110
No matter how amazing a card it may be,
it'll only be a convenience store or Don Q***ote.

115
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,310
W-Welcome.

116
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,140
Welcome.

117
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,500
No way!

118
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,750
Isn't this the prestigious department store?

119
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,500
It's usually closed at this hour!

120
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,750
I'll pay for everything with this.

121
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,890
Most certainly.

122
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,980
Milady, this is...

123
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,140
What, you don't even know what a chariot is?

124
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,750
Usually cows pull this.

125
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,720
They even attached it to the bike.

126
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,630
I'm the cow?!

127
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,840
Nagi? Nagi?

128
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,300
Where did she go to?

129
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,570
I don't see Hayate-kun around, either.

130
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,680
She left her manga out again.

131
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,910
Love at Kujyuukuri?

132
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,850
Could she have...

133
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,340
Shiwasu.

134
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,340
Shiwasu: December in old Japanese.

135
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:58,440
It means everything is busy and even teachers run around.

136
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,490
And, the debt-ridden butler was running, too.

137
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,050
Financial Drift!

138
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,230
This anime follows the speed limit.

139
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,030
This is amazing, Hayate!

140
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,520
There's no one that matches your ability on highways.

141
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,750
That's right. No one can possibly catch up to me with my boots on maximum output!

142
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,630
Hey, but are we allowed to get on the highway on a bicycle?

143
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,980
Good thing I bought the highway in advance.

144
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,830
Adult reasoning.

145
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,690
Yeah, exactly.

146
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,390
Flashing?

147
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,300
On the highway, that's the signal for the start of the race.

148
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,230
Hayate.

149
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,450
I know.

150
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,170
A miracle is just about to begin!

151
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,560
What will you do, Michael?

152
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,310
I have faith in you, CHITT.

153
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,620
Nobody!

154
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,410
Drives in front of me!

155
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,690
I can see time...

156
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,720
It's the deadly high speed curve! 600R!

157
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,420
I will wipe him out of my rearview mirror at this corner!

158
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,240
Like you have a rearview mirror.

159
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:23,080
27.8% chance of clearing the curve at full throttle.

160
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,070
I have faith in you, CHITT.

161
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,750
Don't spill, Michael.

162
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,690
I can do this...

163
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,470
Secret technique!

164
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,730
Ditch Run!

165
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,190
What shall we do, Michael! Michael?!

166
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,890
Chitt, use the rocket booster!

167
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,260
That's ridiculous! You must be an idiot!

168
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,400
Michael! Michael!

169
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,570
One man can change the world!

170
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,160
You hate to admit the mistakes you make due to youth.

171
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,320
This anime is  obeying the speed limit.

172
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,030
It's pitch dark, but it's the ocean!

173
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,780
It's the ocean!

174
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,690
I can't go on anymore...

175
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:12,060
Looks like we can watch the first sunrise of the year together.

176
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,630
Ocean!

177
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,130
A-Anyway, I'll go buy something warm.

178
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,330
Yup. I'll wait right here.

179
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,730
Ocean!

180
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,410
Come to think of it, I didn't bring my wallet with me.

181
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,160
Here you go.

182
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,540
M-Maria-san!

183
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:38,890
Even for you, it's dangerous to go at that speed with someone in the back.

184
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:43,030
I'm sorry. I was pushing the speed limit.

185
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:51,400
We'll take care of the bike and the chariot, so please use that money to come back.

186
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,070
I'm sorry...

187
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,000
Really... For all the trouble I cause you...

188
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,640
Not at all. I'm the one who should be thanking you.

189
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,180
You're protecting and guiding Nagi well.

190
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,590
Of course, there are still tiny problems.

191
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,760
I'm not doing much.

192
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,510
She has looked happy ever since you've come.

193
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,370
And so have I.

194
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,550
Oh, also-

195
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,690
Happy New Year, Hayate-kun.

196
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,250
Happy New Year to you, too.

197
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,510
I hope we get along well this year, too.

198
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,620
Yes!

199
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,290
Milady!

200
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,440
The sun will rise soon.

201
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,880
Here's an oshiruko.

202
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,950
Also, Happy...

203
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:55,020
...New...Year's...

204
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,840
Happy New Year's, Milady.

205
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,860
Karuta asobi demo shimashouka?

206
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,860
Karuta asobi demo shimashouka? = Shall we play with karuta cards?

207
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,860
Karutaka... Kattaru

208
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,860
Karutaka... Kattaru = Karuta cards, eh... So lame.

209
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,900
Night on New Year's day.

210
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,600
It's heavy snow before you know it.

211
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,950
It's covered in white out there.

212
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,200
By the way, Sakuya-san called saying she'll visit for a New Year's greeting.

213
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,390
What? Saku's coming?

214
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,830
Actually, why are you dressed up?

215
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:51,220
Oh why can't I? Since we don't do any New Year's activities.

216
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,920
New year... Heavy snow around the world... Global warming...

217
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,220
We never know when our peaceful life might end.

218
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,260
Humans must pay attention to ecology while reflecting on great prosperity.

219
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,670
It's not persuasive at all to hear you say that
while playing a portable game in a warmed room.

220
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,360
It's portable, so I'm playing a role in the ecology.

221
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,880
Oh my, we're having a black out?

222
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,720
Are you both all right?

223
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,530
Ah, Hayate-kun. I'm fine, but Nagi is...

224
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,140
Be... Because it got dark all of a sudden...

225
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,560
I see. The electrical line must have fallen due to the snow.

226
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,120
The emergency circuit should come on at times like this.

227
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,910
The circuit breaker in the annex could be down.

228
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,750
We'll have to go turn it back on.

229
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,030
Then go do whatever you need to with the breaker.

230
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,540
I'll die if it's this dark.

231
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,030
Milady...

232
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:47,860
Could you do something while the battery in the game she's playing to distract herself lasts?

233
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,770
Roger that!

234
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,120
The time limit is about three hours.

235
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,310
Tonight's mission is to bring the electricity back.

236
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:59,730
The destination is the power plant about 1km away from this main building.

237
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:00,920
In any case,

238
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,180
it's a butler-like job I get to do once in a while.

239
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,220
I've got to do my best!

240
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,160
By the way, outside is a blizzard.

241
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,360
Wow...

242
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,950
I-It's blowing harder than I'd thought.

243
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,330
This is supposed to be Tokyo.

244
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,600
We're in middle of Nerima.

245
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,640
Is this the famous tsundere?

246
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,280
The Earth must be becoming tsundere.

247
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,120
You mean, becoming like tundra.

248
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,990
For your information, tsundere is...

249
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,600
Anyway, let's go take a look.

250
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,220
I won't go anywhere, so please don't pull, okay?

251
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,210
If you do, I'd start spinning.

252
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,790
Y-You said Saku was coming, didn't you?

253
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,740
You're right. Where could she be?

254
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,270
It'd be funny if we found her stranded in the yard.

255
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,800
No, that's not funny at all.

256
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:47,080
B-But, this blizzard might really leave me stranded here.

257
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:54,120
However, I must get the electricity back for the sake of Milady, who's shivering in the dark.

258
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,340
I can't lose!

259
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,200
I can't lose.

260
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,440
I can't lose to snow like this!

261
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,600
Wait! This is a snow blower!

262
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,320
And what are you doing here?!

263
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,480
Hey.

264
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,030
"Wait! This is a snow blower!"

265
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,360
Good job. Nice jab.

266
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,850
Don't tell me you were waiting at this really cold place just for this, Sakuya-san?

267
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,020
Pretty much.

268
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,510
Nice jab!

269
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,320
What's the point of this?

270
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,760
He's getting better.

271
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,890
What happened to your butlers?

272
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:37,350
When I plugged the thing in, the mansion's building went out, so they went running to fix it.

273
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,620
This is the cause of the blackout?

274
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,730
Sorry.

275
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:46,430
At any rate, you'll catch a cold if you stay here for so long.

276
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,280
Please hurry up and go inside.

277
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,270
I'd like to, but...

278
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,800
Which way inside?

279
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,820
We might really die here.

280
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,010
SFX: GHOOOOOOOOOOOO

281
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,020
Anyway, this isn't a snowy mountain or anything.

282
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,130
We will manage.

283
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,850
Please follow me.

284
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,970
Hey, you're surprisingly reliable.

285
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,090
An hour has passed.

286
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:17,490
SFX: GHOOOOOOOOOOOO

287
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,170
Hey, can I take my words back?

288
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,510
Can you not wait for just a little longer?

289
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,980
What?!

290
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,460
Yeti! It's a Yeti!

291
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,370
Perfect! I'll go ask for directions.

292
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,770
A Yeti must know the way around the snow well.

293
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,700
He was kind enough to tell me.

294
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,720
What?

295
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,590
I take back saying I take back my words.

296
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,950
He is pretty amazing.

297
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,480
This is the power plant. Pika.

298
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,520
My jacket's soaked.

299
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,640
Yes. We're literally soaked.

300
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:56,030
It took more time than expected to get here, so I better turn the breaker on and switch to the emergency circuit.

301
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,990
You don't get wind blowing in here, but it's still really cold.

302
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:05,390
I see. It's a geothermal power plant.

303
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:10,010
Looks like this place has an onsen, as well, so how about a dip?

304
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,980
SFX: BLUSH

305
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,600
Onsen?

306
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:16,210
Onsen at a place like this, with just the two of us...

307
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,430
That's embarrassing...

308
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,790
How so?

309
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,150
What was that for?!

310
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,400
Shut up, you fool!

311
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,380
That one seriously pissed me off!

312
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,310
So, why?

313
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,520
You want another smack?!

314
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,190
Get your ass over here.

315
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,870
Why are you doing this?

316
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,670
Shut up!

317
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,130
Please stop!

318
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,200
Stop moving.

319
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,010
So, how about it?

320
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,050
Like I've been saying, what is?

321
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,960
I am the oldest sister, so don't treat me like a kid too much.

322
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,190
I don't want to hear that from a person who does something like this.

323
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,790
How dare you! Then take this!

324
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,480
I was joking!

325
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,560
I'm not treating you like a kid.

326
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,010
O-Okay.

327
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,130
Great, I put myself in a bad situation.

328
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,260
I think I'm going to be dizzy.

329
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,690
What should we do? The breaker is still far from here.

330
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,130
Seeing how soaked we are,
we might freeze to death before we get there.

331
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,250
But I can't make Milady wait any longer!

332
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,300
I'm sorry. Should I come with you?

333
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,900
No, I think you shouldn't.

334
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,830
Since, you are a girl, after all.

335
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,570
I'll be going now.

336
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:05,060
Is that the waterproof cell phone ******** advertising?

337
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,630
Hey, Makita?

338
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,490
Is Kunieda there, too?

339
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,720
Two hours and fifty minutes into the mission.

340
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,960
Five more meters to the breaker room.

341
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,690
But, the drenched debt-ridden butler was facing the verge of death.

342
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,430
Oh no... My sight's starting to fade from the cold.

343
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,120
I might have done better if I'd gone naked.

344
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,380
That's visually a bad idea.

345
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,790
I'll die at this rate.

346
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,990
But... Just a little more...

347
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,840
Just a little more and I can provide the electricity for Milady...

348
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,380
But, I'm... already...

349
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,000
Milady...

350
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,320
Oh no, the lamp's light went out.

351
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,070
What?

352
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,810
Could... Could something have happened to Hayate?

353
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:59,110
My Gladi**** is dead.

354
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,580
Could this be a sign?

355
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,680
I think that's because you looked away.

356
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,450
The light's back.

357
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,730
So Hayate must be all right!

358
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,150
But your Gladi**** is dead.

359
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:23,000
I managed to get the breakers back up, but I can't get any strength in my body.

360
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,820
Oh man... It's so cold, I can't take another step.

361
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,390
Milady...

362
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,520
Maria-san...

363
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,050
I'm...

364
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,450
I had a good life.

365
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,360
Hayate!

366
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,330
You can't give up! Get yourself together!

367
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,880
Sakuya-san?

368
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,660
We're here to save you.

369
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,060
You're fine now.

370
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,280
Look at you, you're freezing.

371
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,930
Your hands are really warm.

372
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,080
You did well.

373
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,750
I was thinking wrongly of you.

374
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,070
You are an amazing guy.

375
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:17,840
Yes, but, since it's winter, this chilly weather...

376
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,640
I'm sick of it.

377
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,030
Just kidding.

378
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,500
Makita! Kunieda! We'll leave that idiot here!

379
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:34,910
Yes, ma'am.

380
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,140
Wait, Sakuya-san!

381
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,890
Oh no, the lamp cracked.

382
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,580
Looks like my Gladi**** is completely dead.

383
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,920
On another note, is Hayate really all right out there?

384
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,070
This is how the first night of the new year ends.

385
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:54,150
Next week, we'll fight against sudden farewells.

386
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,920
Nagi and,

387
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,980
Hayate's

388
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,720
Butler Network!

389
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,870
Summoned and appeared. I'm Sanzenin Nagi.

390
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:36,830
I'm Ayasaki Hayate.

391
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,560
A new development begins starting this week.

392
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,380
With a new enemy to face, the tension is building up again.

393
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,050
Next week, a mysterious rival character will transfer in.

394
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:47,750
To spoil you, he joins our side close to
the final episode and fights against evil.

395
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,760
Did you watch the show, Milady?

396
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,610
It wasn't making that kind of turnaround at all.

397
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:52,580
Oh, it wasn't?

398
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,660
The fourth season is filled with episodes comic fans will be happy to see.

399
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,210
Not like we can trust it too much.

400
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:58,880
Have a good year.

401
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:03,920
Good morning.

402
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,220
Hey there. If you chitchat too long, you'll be late to school.

403
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,280
Katsura-sensei is acting differently than usual!

404
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,950
She looks dazzling.

405
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,120
Sadly, life is filled with sudden goodbyes.

406
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,430
You idiot, Onee-chan!

407
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,600
I don't care about you!

408
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,670
You can go die on a street in the middle of nowhere!

409
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:22,070
Next time, Sensei Farewell Despair Graduation Special.

410
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,850
Make sure to jack into Hayate no Gotoku next week, too.
