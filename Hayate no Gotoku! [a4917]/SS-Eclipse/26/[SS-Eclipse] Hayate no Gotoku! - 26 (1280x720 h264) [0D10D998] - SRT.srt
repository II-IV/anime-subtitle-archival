1
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:09,330
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:09,950
Got it?

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,260
I'm not giving Hayate-kun to you!

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,460
He's... He's...

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,900
My important butler!

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,470
A butler is one who serves.

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,970
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:35,890
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,910
Yes.

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:45,910
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

11
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,600
Would you like to become my butler?

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,340
Gladly, Milady.

13
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:50,660
Who are you?

14
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,050
The story traces back to this morning.

15
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,900
Ayasaki Hayate, returns!

16
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,600
Wake up, Make up!

17
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,840
No!

18
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,960
Yes, these are the right clothes.

19
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:47,780
Last episode, Hayate was taken in by Isumi's house,
but now, he's back at the Sanzenins'.

20
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,670
I must devote myself to Milady.

21
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,420
Was I summoned?

22
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,200
Um, Milady?

23
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,270
Hey, Hayate.

24
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,040
Yes?

25
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,760
I have a question. Have you ever had amnesia?

26
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,810
Amnesia?

27
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,080
No, I don't remember experiencing it.

28
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,060
Apparently she's going to submit something to a manga contest.

29
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,720
Yes. I want to try one of the over-used settings;
amnesia this time.

30
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,670
Like running out of the house from the shock of getting the sheep sold and getting run over by a horse carriage.

31
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,590
Or like cold-sleep.

32
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,350
Indeed, there are countless precedents for this setting.

33
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,910
But I will say this.

34
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,000
That's exactly why it's worth the challenge.

35
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,980
And, she's thinking of a situation using amnesia, but...

36
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,220
Nothing's coming to mind...

37
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:53,360
How about I go to Wataru-kun's place and borrow several movies with an amnesia theme?

38
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,310
I see. Y-Yeah, that would...

39
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,390
Order me anything!

40
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,950
I am your obedient butler!

41
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,420
Hayate.

42
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,390
I'll be on my way now!

43
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:07,840
Maria.

44
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,730
Hayate is the most reliable man in the universe, isn't he?

45
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,360
Well, yes...

46
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,700
I hope he won't get in any danger.

47
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:28,150
Because of what he said last episode,
Hayate's life was constantly in danger.

48
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,820
Pass this on to the other candidates, as well.

49
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,990
Anyone who wants the Sanzenin estate will have to defeat her butler, Ayasaki Hayate, first!

50
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,300
Hey, Ayasaki Hayate.

51
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,460
I owe you one from last time!

52
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,380
That voice! Is it Gilbert-san?

53
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,640
I will take the Sanzenin estate.

54
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,830
Seriously...

55
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,030
You don't learn, do you?!

56
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,720
How foolish of you to put yourself in a mobile coffin!

57
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,970
Wh-Why you!

58
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,390
Let's see.

59
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,220
Today's lucky item.

60
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:01,990
Pizza.

61
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,330
Lucky Point: Park.

62
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,450
An encounter with a prince
on a white horse could be waiting for you.

63
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,380
Maybe...

64
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,920
I'll get to meet Hayate-kun?

65
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,160
But, as if something like that would happen.

66
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,870
Hayate-kun?

67
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,740
No way!

68
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,870
Nishizawa-san?

69
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,700
Get off of me, dang it!

70
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,880
H-Hayate-kun...

71
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,120
It really is you, right, Hayate-kun?

72
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,650
B-But, what are you doing?

73
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,810
Why are you fighting against that thing?

74
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,500
Well...

75
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,990
Ayasaki Hayate.

76
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,320
Prepare to die!

77
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,860
I'll explain later!

78
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,560
We need to get out of here!

79
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,130
Y-Yes.

80
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,050
No, this kind of idea won't do.

81
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:58,840
Forget fax.

82
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,250
I can't even expect to get fifty of these done with this special paper's tone.

83
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,680
Nagi, you have a call from Sakuya-san.

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,260
You're not getting any signal. Bye.

85
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,210
Hold on!

86
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,230
Hey, is my stupid Aniki over there?

87
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,280
Stupid Aniki?

88
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,550
You talking about Gilbert?

89
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,110
That jerk rented some super-weapon under my name.

90
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,480
W-Weapon?

91
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,630
Yeah, yeah.

92
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,980
Man, the heiki's not getting better at all.

93
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:27,530
Note: Heiki = Weapon; Keiki = Economy

94
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,530
You mean keiki!

95
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:32,140
Went off on a tangent, but I bet he's off to make the debt-ridden butler cry.

96
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,940
If he shows up, can you give him a light spanking?

97
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,080
Nagi?

98
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,110
It's Hayate, so I don't think we'll have to worry much, but...

99
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,580
Call the SPs!

100
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,820
We'll search for Hayate.

101
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,320
There it is!

102
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,550
Nishizawa-san, can you be on your own feet for a second?

103
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,530
Y-Yes!

104
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,590
A little something that Maria-san gave me in case of times like this.

105
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,940
What's this?

106
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,480
I see. So this is how it works.

107
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,050
Thank you, Maria-san.

108
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,080
This is a great help.

109
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,830
Hayate-kun, it's back.

110
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,570
I'm getting sick.

111
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,560
This mecha makes me 3D sick.

112
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,410
Set, on hand!

113
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,930
Hayate-kun!

114
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,040
What's going on?

115
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,390
Hayate-kun!

116
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,090
Hayate-kun.

117
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,500
You'd better remember this!

118
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,060
Hayate-kun, get a hold of yourself.

119
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,430
Hayate-kun!

120
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,100
Tens of thousands of years later,

121
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,980
Hayate, who had lost his memory,

122
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,440
was floating through space alone.

123
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,370
Nu... Nunna... lly...

124
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,100
Welcome back.

125
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,590
Oh, it was a dream.

126
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:36,560
That's right, I have to return with
an amnesia plot quickly for Milady.

127
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,080
Ah... What am I doing?

128
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,660
H-Hayate-kun, I-I'll call an ambulance right away!

129
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,700
You can't die!

130
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,360
Um...

131
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,510
Thank goodness!

132
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,570
Are you all right?

133
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,900
Does your head hurt at all?

134
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,530
No, not really.

135
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,210
And ah... Your leg...

136
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,260
Why am I giving him a lap pillow?

137
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:56,510
Ow.

138
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,060
That hurt.

139
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,390
I-It's been a while since we've seen each other alone.

140
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,220
Yes.

141
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,390
Um, I always wanted to ask.

142
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,630
You shied away that time but...

143
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,410
I'm...

144
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,930
...only interested in 2D.

145
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,370
SFX: Gahhh!!

146
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,370
Gahhh!!

147
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:23,340
So, to be honest with yourself, what do you think of me?

148
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,590
So?

149
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,630
Um...

150
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,250
So? So?

151
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,880
My head!

152
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,450
Hayate-kun?

153
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,800
Where is this?

154
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,720
Who am I?

155
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,040
Crap! I came up with something based off the setting, again!

156
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,930
This can't possibly work.

157
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,280
A-Amnesia?

158
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,940
Hayate-kun has amnesia!

159
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,470
You're going to believe it?

160
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,820
What should I do? I've never dealt with real amnesia before!

161
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,180
Oh, Winter ******! ****** Sonata!

162
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,740
I should have watched ****** ******!

163
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,230
Sorry for the wait.

164
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,290
Thanks for your order!

165
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,000
Oh right, I had ordered it since I was hungry.

166
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,680
I totally forgot about it.

167
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,630
Hey, could you possibly be a butler?

168
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,880
Hey, you are, right?

169
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,790
Wow, this is my first time seeing one.

170
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,460
Then she must be your lady.

171
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,940
So, I should get the money from the butler?

172
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,480
Um, the bill.

173
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,550
M-My butler, Hayate-kun.

174
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,380
Wh-What are you spacing out?

175
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,210
Hurry and pay him the bill.

176
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,090
Y-Yes, right away, Milady.

177
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:55,240
Yes, that! I always wanted to see that once!

178
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,900
Here's your tea, Milady.

179
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,940
Thank you.

180
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,530
So I was your butler?

181
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,840
That's right, Ayasaki Hayate-kun.

182
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,220
You... You're Nishizawa Ayumu's butler.

183
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,870
I've done it...

184
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,700
I'm trapped. I can't find the timing to quit this at all.

185
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,430
What should I do? Hayate-kun seems to believe me.

186
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,870
Oh well! Things will turn out as they should.

187
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,630
This is good!

188
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,300
Could the taste be different from one side to the other?

189
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,740
Yes, this is called "half-and-half".

190
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:46,120
Butler Hayate-kun, why not eat this side, too?

191
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,370
Yes, thank you.

192
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,190
This is so good.

193
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,340
I've never tasted something like this before.

194
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,640
That's anchovy.

195
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,840
You've never had anchovies before?

196
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,200
Ah... No...

197
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,110
I've seen them when I was doing a part-time job, but...

198
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,560
This tastes great, Lady Ayumu!

199
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:13,360
Could this possibly be a present from God himself?

200
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,210
Hayate!

201
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,580
And... Could you be...

202
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,820
The Burglar Hamster!

203
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,690
Milady...

204
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,410
Hey, Hayate, what is this about?

205
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,910
Stop this ridiculous joke.

206
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,630
Um...

207
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,430
I'm not giving Hayate-kun to you!

208
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,190
He's... He's...

209
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,560
My important butler!

210
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,060
What?!

211
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,710
Crap! Now I'll have to end this even if it's forcefully.

212
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,970
Hayate-kun?

213
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,210
My head hurts...

214
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:48,650
Hayate!

215
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,580
Okay, now's my chance.

216
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,800
What...

217
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,320
Hayate!

218
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,700
Hayate's experiencing amnesia?

219
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,390
That's ridiculous!

220
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,040
Rest assured, Hayate.

221
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,400
I will get your memory back.

222
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,230
I lost my chance again.

223
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,880
Um, how long should I pretend that I'm asleep?

224
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,880
Indo kare ha karezo

225
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,880
Indo kare ha karezo = Curry from India is hot.

226
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,160
Zou ha okkiin dazo.

227
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,850
Zou ha okkiin dazo. Sabu. = Elephants are large, you know. So dumb.

228
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,850
Sabu.

229
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:33,020
We will now start Project Ayasaki Hayate's Memory Restoration.

230
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,930
Conveniently, I was in the midst of thinking about what amnesia is today.

231
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:43,280
I have several missions prepared,
so I'd like to ask for help from everyone.

232
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,990
I-I'm starting to feel like I'm in danger.

233
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,580
But Milady was working so hard over an idea for her manga.

234
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,960
If this could trigger a spark in her...

235
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,990
All right!

236
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,430
What? Where is this?

237
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,410
I'm...

238
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,540
Oh, Hayate, you're awake!

239
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,260
A-Are you all right?

240
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,200
Yes...

241
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,100
Hayate!

242
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,520
Yes?

243
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,810
I hear that you have amnesia and believe you're this Hamster's butler, am I right?

244
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,700
Ah, yes, I'm Lady Ayumu's-

245
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,670
No!

246
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,150
Hayate! You're my, Sanzenin Nagi's, butler!

247
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,270
She's right!

248
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,570
Ayasaki Hayate, how pathetic.

249
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:28,110
I will bring this guy's memory back no matter what it takes.

250
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,110
Klaus, are you saying that I won't be able to restore his memory?

251
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,040
I'm sorry, but yes I am.

252
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,560
Interesting. I'll take the challenge.

253
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,800
We'll fight to see who can restore Hayate's memory!

254
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,070
I know I'll be the winner.

255
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,290
Um, fight?

256
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,100
So Hayate, do you remember something now?

257
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,950
It's your favorite clothes.

258
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,340
Favorite?

259
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,750
That prettiness!

260
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,960
I sort of remember seeing it in episode eight.

261
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,440
No... I never knew Hayate-kun had such tastes.

262
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,330
And so Project Memory Restoration began.

263
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,120
Come now! Defeat him in one blow!

264
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,020
But I can't turn into his food.

265
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,470
All right, I'll use this as my chance!

266
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,640
Enough!

267
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,950
No... I never knew Hayate-kun could kill tigers.

268
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,120
My memory's-

269
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:40,920
Looks like it's not back yet.

270
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,820
That's not what you used before.

271
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,290
Looks like we need to put off the decision.

272
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,350
Why...

273
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,060
Lady Nagi and Klaus fought on.

274
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:52,270
They fought on and on to get Hayate's memory back.

275
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,560
He still doesn't have his memory back?

276
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,100
All that's left now is applying shock.

277
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,570
Wait! Please stop!

278
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,360
Stop!

279
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,460
Go!

280
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,580
A parachute?

281
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,140
Klaus-san!!!

282
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:24,310
That yell! Maybe Hayate-kun got his memory back?

283
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:28,010
Or, maybe he didn't lose it to begin with?

284
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,440
Great observation.

285
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,830
No, not yet!

286
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:35,460
Hayate's memory can't possibly be restored with what Klaus could come up with.

287
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,010
I-I see.

288
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,870
But, Hayate isn't coming up.

289
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,550
Maria, minimum throttle. Let's search for him just in case.

290
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,530
I think this is going over the top.

291
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,660
Um...

292
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,980
Please forgive her.

293
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,380
Nagi means all of this to be for Hayate-kun.

294
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,430
In her own way.

295
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,190
Hey, Hayate! Are you all right?

296
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,940
If you are, answer me!

297
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,480
Hey!

298
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,630
It's a little frustrating.

299
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,450
A lot has happened without me knowing.

300
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,850
Between Hayate-kun and her...

301
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:23,790
What?

302
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,970
Was there an island like this
when we came here fishing the other day?

303
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,190
I'm not sure.

304
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,660
Let's land there.

305
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,870
Maria, dock on the shore.

306
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:32,580
Yes!

307
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,500
Me too!

308
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,240
What the?

309
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,950
Could this be from Lake Sanzenin's strange ecosystem?

310
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:03,700
Oh no!

311
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,870
What? The engine stalls at a time like this?!

312
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,080
Those voices are...

313
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,350
Milady and Nishizawa-san!

314
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,370
Wh-What is this guy?

315
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:35,590
Could you be...

316
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,660
The turtle of the island? Are you?

317
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,470
L-Let's run. Hurry.

318
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,810
W-Well, that landing wrenched my waist.

319
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,440
Ow!

320
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:55,960
Hayate-kun would...

321
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,920
At times like this, Hayate-kun would...

322
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,150
Hey!

323
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,450
That way!

324
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,700
Hey you, stop it!

325
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,350
She's an important person to Hayate-kun.

326
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,900
If you touch her...

327
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,560
I won't forgive you!

328
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,570
Do you hear?

329
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,830
Nishizawa-san.

330
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,420
Hey, Hamster! I like your intentions, but don't sound so weak at the end.

331
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,220
Stop it, you reptile!

332
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,280
Hayate.

333
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,750
Hayate-kun?

334
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,520
I won't stay calm if you do anything to these two!

335
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,680
Milady! Nishizawa-san!

336
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,160
Are you two all right? Are you hurt anywhere?

337
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,850
Hayate-kun...

338
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:04,720
You...

339
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,320
I'm sorry for putting you in danger.

340
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,320
I'm a failure as a Sanzenin butler.

341
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,970
Hayate! Your memory's back!

342
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,580
Thank goodness, Hayate-kun.

343
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,530
But... I'm...

344
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:20,950
It's fine as long as you're back to who you've always been.

345
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:21,840
Yup.

346
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,070
Yes!

347
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,070
Thank you very much!

348
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:31,040
All right, that's the end of Project Hayate Memory Restore!

349
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,190
Are you sure you don't have to send her off?

350
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,650
Much to my regret, I was saved by her this time.

351
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,660
So I'll let her have a chance to be alone with him

352
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,960
Owie.

353
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,960
I'm glad I was able to see what your new life is like.

354
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,460
I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused.

355
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,430
Hayate-kun, do you remember what I asked you at the park?

356
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,330
No, what was it?

357
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,410
My head is little foggy today.

358
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,270
I knew it.

359
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,970
That lady is very important to you, right?

360
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:13,310
But... you're very important to me, too.

361
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,620
Nishizawa-san.

362
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,560
Hayate-kun, next time...

363
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,460
Let's go to a pizza place sometime.

364
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,940
You've never had anchovy pizza, right?

365
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,520
But you'll love it!

366
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,900
I just know you will.

367
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,150
I just do.

368
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,880
As if, right?

369
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,680
I'll see you again, somewhere out there.

370
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,700
Nishizawa-san...

371
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:43,040
Leaving a bitter memory in Hayate's heart,
Nishizawa-san leaves the Sanzenin mansion.

372
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,950
And Klaus was...

373
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,850
A little to the right...

374
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,480
As you see.

375
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,470
He's off to oblivion on autopilot.

376
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,860
Next week, we'll fight against a new development.

377
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,120
Nagi and...

378
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,390
Hayate's...

379
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,120
Butler Network!

380
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,920
Magical Change into Sanzenin Nagi.

381
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,190
And I'm Ayasaki Hayate.

382
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:41,270
It's almost half a year since this anime started.

383
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,230
Yes, we made it here, but the path ahead is still long.

384
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,690
I'm still counting on you, Hayate.

385
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,470
Yes, Milady.

386
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:49,020
And starting next week, we'll have a new opening.

387
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,920
The plot will be a battle of butlers over the legendary butler uniform.

388
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,650
Hayate no Gotoku Casa**na Saga.

389
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,350
What? Really?

390
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,950
I bet it's something like that.

391
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,390
Bye bye.

392
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,550
What is this Butler Battle Tournament?

393
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,160
It doesn't make any sense!

394
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,590
It's as you see.

395
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:10,100
I wanted to find out the levels of
the butlers we have at this school.

396
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,690
She's the superintendent?!

397
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,640
She is my dear Kuzuha-sama.

398
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,090
I won't forgive you.

399
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,100
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

400
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,740
Hayate Rises Upon the Earth.

401
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:25,370
Hayate, I want to see you win the tournament.

402
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,910
Will you be able to live through it?
