1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,210
When watching TV,

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,680
make sure the room is well lit,

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,880
and watch from a distance.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,950
Got it?

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,220
Hey! Nagi!

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,530
I'm here to visit ya!

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,850
Jump! Jump, Tama!

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,770
What the heck are you doing?

9
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,480
Oh, Saku. As you see, I'm giving Tama exercise.

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,170
Exercise?

11
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,140
She just saw a circus on TV,
where animals jump through a ring of fire.

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,920
And she says it's a perfect exercise for Tama.

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,180
There you have it.

14
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,380
Now jump! If a cat in a circus can do it,
then there's no reason you can't!

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,550
You moron!

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,710
What was that for?

17
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,500
There's no way he can possibly jump through that small ring!

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,210
And, animal abuse is more of a problem than copyright violation stuff.

19
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,270
Don't you know that it's constantly discussed during plot meetings?

20
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:02,340
Even if one or two scriptwriters were sacked,
it's not like the main heroine would get her seat taken away.

21
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,980
Um, both of you, borderline conversation like that is not appreciated.

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,140
There, there. You don't have to be scared anymore.

23
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,360
Hey! Don't side with Saku!

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,360
You're my pet!

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,450
Wow, I didn't know Sakuya-san
was good at taking care of animals.

26
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,840
Not just animals.

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,760
Right, Nagi?

28
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,200
Wh-Why are you asking me?

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,620
She's right. Nagi likes Sakuya-san like a real older sis-

30
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,310
Stop it Maria!

31
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,470
One who masters being a butler becomes the master of the world.

32
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:41,980
The Butler War that shakes the planet has started!

33
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,990
Is it one of those youthful indiscretions?

34
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,320
Shut up!

35
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,990
So you used to call Sakuya-san "Saku-neechan" when you were little, Milady?

36
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,570
It's a horrid past.

37
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:37,410
I have lots of younger siblings.

38
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,000
So I used to take care of Nagi along with them.

39
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,770
She used to be very cute when she was little.

40
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,000
She would always have Sakuya-san-

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,970
I told you not to say anything!

42
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:52,180
Nagi never took care of little kids,
so she's a brat no matter how much she grows.

43
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,550
Don't make fun of me.

44
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:58,420
If I had younger siblings, then I could take care of them better than Saku.

45
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,310
Are you sure? Then prove it.

46
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,330
You got it.

47
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,310
Hey, Hayate!

48
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:03,820
Yes?

49
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,460
W-Why did I end up in one of these getups again?

50
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,130
He's adorable!

51
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,930
Be glad. You look great, Hayate.

52
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,370
I'm not happy at all!

53
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,820
And first of all, why am I dressed in girl's clothes?

54
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,970
Don't worry about that detail.

55
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,440
I will take care of you from now on.

56
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,190
Take your chance to be spoiled by me.

57
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,750
But what exactly can I do?

58
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,860
You don't get it, do you?

59
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,260
All you have to do is say,
"Nagi-oneesama," and come cling to me.

60
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,770
Nagi-oneesama!

61
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,450
What's wrong?

62
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,810
Y-You...

63
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,700
Pervert!

64
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,920
How dare you do that and take advantage of the situation!

65
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,990
I don't remember raising you like that!

66
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,930
Forgive me, Milady.

67
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,250
I mean, Nagi-oneesama.

68
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,290
So, debt-ridden butler. It's not easy taking care of Nagi, is it?

69
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,820
It's as usual.

70
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,050
It didn't go right because we don't have an actual kid.

71
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,530
A real child, you say?

72
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:25,410
Yes. And there are forests and jungles
in this property that kids may have gotten lost in.

73
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,600
Hayate! Go find some at once!

74
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,610
That's a little...

75
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,150
I have something like this, too.

76
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,680
R-Right away!

77
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,140
She's a spoiled brat.

78
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,660
But what's Hayate-kun going to do?

79
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,570
She asked for a real child, but...

80
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,510
It might boil down to him having to kidnap someone.

81
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,310
Here they are.

82
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,670
Eh?!

83
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,670
SFX: EH?!

84
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,230
What does this mean?

85
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,510
You didn't really go kidnap them, did you?

86
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,270
You got it wrong. Please calm down, Sakuya-san.

87
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,880
Lost children?

88
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,190
Yes. They were walking around the gate,
so I took them into custody.

89
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,620
They are here on a family trip and got separated from their family.

90
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:20,060
It's not Isumi-san we're talking about, so how did they get lost here?

91
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,190
We need to contact the police.

92
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,360
No, we don't want to go there!

93
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,940
Even if they say no...

94
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,880
You don't have to be afraid.

95
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,040
They wouldn't come attacking on I*grams all of a sudden.

96
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,260
The Special ******* Section wouldn't mobilize for lost kids!

97
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,550
Don't bother.

98
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:41,980
Milady?

99
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,620
We were in need of children.

100
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,540
We'll take care of them here for a while.

101
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,260
Don't be an idiot! It's not like getting a pet, so you can't do that.

102
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,520
Thank you, very rich Onee-chan.

103
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,040
Rich Onee-chan.

104
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,250
Look, they're so cute.

105
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,020
What are your names?

106
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,100
I'm Itsuki.

107
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,050
I'm Shunji.

108
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,880
Nice to meet you, very rich Onee-chan.

109
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,740
Hayate! Looks like I have the tendency to be liked by children.

110
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,720
But their parents must be worried about them right now.

111
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,450
Don't worry about that.

112
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,980
SPs! Come!

113
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:30,120
Listen! In the name of the Sanzenin SPs,
find these children's parents!

114
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,760
Yes, Ma'am!

115
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,180
Don't worry. I'll get you two back with your parents right away.

116
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,040
T-Thank you.

117
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,550
But take your time.

118
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,810
We're not in that big of a rush.

119
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,330
You two are my little brothers from now on.

120
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,190
So I'll take good care of both of you.

121
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,100
Really?

122
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,560
What will you do for us, rich Onee-chan?

123
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,950
Come on, now. Call me Nagi-oneesama.

124
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,160
Yes, Nagi-oneesama.

125
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,500
What's the matter, Sakuya-san?

126
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,340
Wha-

127
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,660
Why?

128
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,620
I was thinking about something.

129
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,480
You didn't have to smack me.

130
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,000
Now...

131
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,920
I said I'd take care of them, but what exactly should I do?

132
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,660
Nagi-oneesama, how much is the vase?

133
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,030
That's only ¥10,000,000.

134
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,740
What about this picture?

135
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,240
That's got to be under ¥30,000,000.

136
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,680
Wow!

137
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,740
Hey, Nagi!

138
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,150
What do you want, Saku?

139
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,270
I just wanted to drop off my stuff.

140
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,780
Sure, go ahead, I don't care.

141
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:57,280
It's my more-expensive-than-junk valuables that were just lying around, so don't you dare touch them.

142
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,040
I'm not interested in your stuff.

143
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,480
All right then.

144
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:10,830
Okay. I'll show you two even more amazing treasure!

145
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,440
Treasure?

146
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,930
We want to see it!

147
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,980
Read anything you want!

148
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,010
This is the treasure?

149
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,810
What's wrong? They're all valuable rare doujinshi.

150
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:32,520
It doesn't seem that different from what she does when she's alone.

151
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,520
You're right.

152
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,660
Looks like you two still don't get it.

153
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,250
Look! There are only 200 copies of this in this world.

154
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,860
It contains *******'s final episode-

155
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,220
You idiot!

156
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,310
What was that for, Saku?!

157
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,990
How do you call this taking care of them?

158
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,430
You're dealing with kids, so there's got to be other things to do!

159
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,820
Like reading books to them.

160
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,630
That's a pain.

161
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,750
Get rid of the face! The kids'll copy it.

162
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,120
Besides, this room is for doujinshi.

163
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,150
There are no books for kids here!

164
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,660
You're wrong to begin with then!

165
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,750
Give something more entertaining for them!

166
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,120
Something kids enjoy?

167
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,620
I know!

168
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,190
Do you two like animals?

169
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,200
Animals?

170
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,460
We do!

171
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,550
What's wrong? You said you like animals, so I brought him.

172
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,590
Get to playing with him.

173
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,220
There's a danger of them getting eaten before they get to play.

174
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:27,970
You're right.

175
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,500
You idiot!

176
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,480
What's your problem, Saku?!

177
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,160
You two want to get out of this room ASAP, right?

178
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,550
We do! We do!

179
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,940
What selfish kids.

180
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,220
Then I'll take them to the game room next.

181
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,140
Hold on!

182
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,710
It's better for the kids to play outside rather than staying inside.

183
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,690
You're not the one to make a decision.

184
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,220
I said I'll take care of them.

185
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,030
I want to go outside!

186
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,830
I want to play outside!

187
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,500
Majority wins.

188
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,870
Takoute kanawan wa.

189
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,870
Takoute kanawan wa. = It's so damn expensive.

190
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,910
Wahhoi! Wahhoi!

191
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,910
Wahhoi! Wahhoi! = Wahoo! Wahoo!

192
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:09,820
Hey!

193
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:20,260
I'm the king of MMOs, so why must I play such a retro game?

194
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,090
She doesn't have any stamina, does she?

195
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,670
Shut up! Besides, it's your idea, so why are you taking a seat?

196
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,630
Hey!

197
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,940
Slow poke Nagi!

198
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,680
Come get us if you can!

199
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,910
Damn those brats. Repaying kindness with ingratitude...

200
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,700
Call me Onee-sama!

201
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,590
Milady, do you want me to switch places?

202
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,710
Butt out!

203
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,250
I will catch them no matter what it takes.

204
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,090
One...

205
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:47,810
Two...

206
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,490
She really hates to lose, doesn't she.

207
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,170
Three...

208
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,120
Four...

209
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,670
It is very like her.

210
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,330
Five...

211
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,730
Six...

212
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,030
She hasn't changed at all from when she was little.

213
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:53,520
Seven...

214
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:54,540
Eight...

215
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,000
She was afraid of strangers.

216
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,730
Nine...

217
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,030
She hardly spoke with me in the beginning.

218
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,080
Ten...

219
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:05,100
She was surrounded with adults who just wanted the estate, so I understand her situation.

220
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,140
Hey!

221
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,230
Wanna go off on an adventure?

222
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:18,970
I'm okay.

223
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,350
Just come.

224
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,620
It was little by little, but she started to hang out with others.

225
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,090
I see.

226
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,580
Ninety-nine...

227
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,860
One hundred!

228
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,140
All right...

229
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,690
Wh-What's going on?

230
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,440
Excuse me.

231
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,910
Would you happen to be these children's mother?

232
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,660
Mother?

233
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,490
I don't have children!

234
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,500
Not only can I not take the next step with the boy I like...

235
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,920
I only held his hand...

236
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,540
Oh, the lap pillow, too.

237
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:58,920
Hold on.

238
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,230
What are you making me say?!

239
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,770
Th-This is from Ogikubo station.

240
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,870
Still unable to find anyone like them.

241
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,700
Over.

242
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,750
Negative around Mitaka station.

243
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,350
Negative around Ooizumi Gakuen.

244
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,750
Negative at Anime Town Kamiigusa.

245
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,660
Keep searching!

246
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,380
Search around every station out there!

247
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,480
I'm beat.

248
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,290
That was so much fun.

249
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,960
It feels good to play outside, too, doesn't it?

250
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,540
I wasn't playing.

251
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,230
I was only taking care of them.

252
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,080
But...

253
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,370
It's nice to have siblings.

254
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,340
Nagi...

255
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,380
All right.

256
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,250
Let's do this! I think I can do it this time!

257
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,410
You're not thinking...

258
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,920
I will now make a special meal for you!

259
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,050
Are you sure, Milady?

260
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,000
Maybe we should lend a hand, too.

261
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,620
No. Don't worry.

262
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,510
I won't make the mistakes I made before.

263
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,230
Be good boys and wait, okay?

264
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,580
Yeah.

265
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,030
Okay, it's ready.

266
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,980
Sorry for the wait, Itsuki, Shunji.

267
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,020
Hold on a moment.

268
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,370
Say "Ahh".

269
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,440
Ahh.

270
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,080
I knew it.

271
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,200
Are you all right, Milady?

272
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,450
I am, Hayate.

273
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,080
I can't let it end like this.

274
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,120
With the next Sanzenin's leader's pride on the line!

275
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,810
Hey, let's go.

276
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,260
You can't improve cooking through willpower, alone.

277
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,090
Y-Yeah.

278
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,580
I'll help you, too.

279
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,100
Yes. Thank you.

280
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,140
Oh boy.

281
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,040
Hey, where did they go?

282
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,460
She said this is a valuable treasure.

283
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,100
Onii-chan, let's stop this.

284
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,810
This is wrong.

285
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,610
What are you saying now?

286
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,960
We snuck into a rich family for this.

287
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,430
B-But...

288
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,200
I knew it was something like this.

289
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:24,510
You two smelled really suspicious from the beginning.

290
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:28,080
It doesn't hurt me at all for you to steal something that insignificant.

291
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,810
But...

292
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,410
If you do anything to make
my buddy cry, I won't forgive you.

293
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,050
She's scary.

294
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:37,720
Hey!

295
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,520
What's going on?

296
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,920
Stop you two!

297
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,190
What's the matter, Sakuya-san?

298
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,820
I'll fill in the details later! We need to chase them!

299
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,790
Yes.

300
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,930
How is it?

301
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,040
Maria!

302
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,610
You did well.

303
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,900
Hey. It's really ready this time.

304
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,390
Where did Itsuki and Shunji go?

305
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,550
Now that you mention it, Hayate-kun's missing, too.

306
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,810
Those two were...

307
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,780
I bet there's a story behind it,
but they got away before I could ask.

308
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,390
Maria-san!

309
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,720
What's the rush, both of you?

310
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,620
Well...

311
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,300
Did something happen, Saku?

312
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,550
N-Nagi!

313
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,400
Well, those two turned out-

314
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,280
You moron! Don't say it!

315
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,690
Those two? Is something wrong with Itsuki and Shunji?

316
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,440
They're...

317
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,000
A robber just snuck in.

318
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,720
And took the two away.

319
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,880
What?

320
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,700
Maria. Itsuki and Shunji are safe, right?

321
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,230
They'll come back, right?

322
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:00,480
Don't worry. The security robots will find the robber.

323
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,570
We need to find them before the security robots get them.

324
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,040
Sakuya-san, why did you tell them that?

325
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,840
If Nagi hears the truth, she'll get hurt.

326
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,200
Sakuya-san...

327
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,780
And I'm worried about them, too.

328
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,920
What should we do... This is turning out to be a big mess.

329
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,250
They're going to take us to the cops.

330
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,450
Intruders in sight!

331
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,790
Intruders in sight!

332
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,730
Nii-chan!

333
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,970
We're done for.

334
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,570
Stop it!

335
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,410
Makita! Kunieda!

336
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,720
Are you two safe?

337
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,650
Y-Yeah.

338
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,920
Good grief.

339
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,430
You two better not go telling this to the others.

340
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,980
We're sorry. We'll give this back to you.

341
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,270
So don't turn us in to the police.

342
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,900
Don't worry. We won't hand you over to the police.

343
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,080
Really?

344
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,940
Yeah. And I'll give that to you two, too.

345
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,210
Take it as a gift.

346
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,020
But...

347
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,880
This is a real treasure, right?

348
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,720
Open it.

349
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,250
Saku! What happened?

350
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,640
Did you find the two?

351
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,520
No, I was seeing things.

352
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,180
They didn't get kidnapped.

353
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,810
Then...

354
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:50,930
Their parents came to pick them up.

355
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:51,610
What?

356
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,880
Apparently they had to go home immediately.

357
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,830
They wanted to say goodbye to you,
but they didn't even have the time for that.

358
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,180
My, what a rush.

359
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:03,890
I see.

360
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,800
But they were able to meet their parents.

361
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,630
Thank goodness.

362
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,590
Milady.

363
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,750
Cheer up, Nagi.

364
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,800
Saku.

365
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,800
You've got us.

366
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,240
Yeah!

367
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:32,180
It all took place on an autumn night when we thought the Sanzenin lady would never have to face a lonely moment again.

368
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,990
Next week, we'll fight against a super butler that looks familiar.

369
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,980
Why the heck?!

370
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,530
That's enough!

371
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,730
Why the heck?!

372
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,770
Strive to be bigshot comedians!

373
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,270
That's enough!

374
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,110
Why the heck?!

375
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,300
Make big bucks and become free of poverty!

376
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,900
That's enough!

377
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,300
Why the...

378
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,510
Kuzuha-sama. It is now autumn.

379
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,810
Indeed.

380
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,300
I can't control my appetite.

381
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,150
I agree, Kuzuha-sama.

382
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,520
Come, Mysterious Dark Butler Three!

383
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,110
Bring-

384
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,930
Ayasaki Hayate to us!

385
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,320
It's a dead heat!

386
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,580
It's getting exciting!

387
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,920
The speed!

388
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,710
The liveliness!

389
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,340
The four tires heat up the motor!

390
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,470
That's all there is to the fastest hobby in the world, Minicar *******.

391
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,320
Don't lose! Keep going, my Emp****!

392
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,210
The next corner's where it's decided!

393
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,880
I must find out the mystery behind these strange situations.

394
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,660
Um, who are you?

395
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,680
Dash.

396
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,940
I'm the Mysterious Butler, Mini Yon.

397
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,890
Due to a certain person's request, I'm here to defeat you.

398
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,670
"M-Mysterious"?

399
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,540
Oh I get it. That's the situation they're setting up.

400
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,520
And so, who is this certain person?

401
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,900
Are you curious?

402
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,950
That person is...

403
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,900
Oh no! We have trouble up ahead!

404
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,880
We have a storm blowing into the race!

405
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,250
Will both cars be blown off of the course?

406
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,680
At this rate...

407
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,580
Go!

408
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,730
Goal!

409
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,980
First in is Ayasaki Hayate-kun's machine!

410
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,160
Hayate Magnum!

411
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,690
I did it!

412
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,260
Damn it.

413
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,340
The next race is mine!

414
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,450
Congratulations, Ayasaki Hayate-kun.

415
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,460
Thank you very much.

416
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,560
Wait. I got carried away by the flow again.

417
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,050
But I did find one thing out.

418
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:50,790
Someone is after me.

419
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,870
What are you saying now?

420
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,460
Nishizawa Ayumu's Butler Network!

421
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,180
Hey there. It's Nishizawa Ayumu.

422
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,510
How are you all?

423
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,820
I'm in charge of this section for a while now.

424
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,490
The song you're hearing right now, don't you think it's nice?

425
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,030
It's fitting for a maiden in love, don't you think?

426
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,520
I want you all to remember it
and sing it when you go out for karaoke.

427
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,750
I'm not sure if it'll be in the machine to play though.

428
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,070
You're the burglar hamster!

429
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,930
Right, you were today's guest, weren't you?

430
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,950
I heard I could meet Hayate-kun if I came here.

431
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,500
I heard he'll be late today.

432
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,350
Too bad for you.

433
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,180
Gahhh!

434
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,570
Bye bye.

435
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,950
I heard Isumi is on her way to the mansion.

436
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,970
Alone, too.

437
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,730
Alone?

438
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,310
Please save us!

439
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:14,270
No! I can't! I can't hallucinate in the middle of a city.

440
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,940
Calm down, Sakuya.

441
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,470
This fish is not an entity from your hallucinations.

442
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,940
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

443
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,810
Welcome Demon Hunter Isumi, and Nabeshin.

444
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:25,240
Who is that afro man?

445
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,110
Did you know that Nabeshin can't handle hot food?
