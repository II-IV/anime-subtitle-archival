1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,390
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:09,990
Got it?

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:16,960
To Ayasaki Hayate, the new butler of the Sanzenin family,
a top secret mission was entrusted.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,970
The mission: To sneak into the prestigious Hakuou Academy.

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:29,570
Hayate-kun, we understand that you like high places, so do away with the villain already and go to Nagi.

6
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,540
Slay!

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,200
Evil!

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:31,870
Immediately!

9
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,150
Prepare yourself!

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:38,940
Hina.

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,860
There you go uttering nonsense again.

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,120
And Hayate makes it out of the school in one piece.

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:53,060
However, a new crisis is right around the corner.

14
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,570
What's going on so early in the morning?

15
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,480
A butler is one who serves.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,980
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

17
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:18,920
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

18
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,950
Yes.

19
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:28,970
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

20
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,670
Nagi, I'll be investigating
your new partner to my heart's content.

21
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,810
Milady, it's morning.

22
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:12,800
Please wake up.

23
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,760
Here is your towel, Milady.

24
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,840
Here is your soup.

25
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,790
Here is your bag.

26
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,530
Let's get changed and go to school.

27
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,920
Hayate, it's a refreshing morning, isn't it?

28
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,400
Yes, it really is refreshing.

29
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,910
On a refreshing morning like this, the best thing to do is to go-

30
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,420
...Back to bed.

31
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,480
Wh-Why are you going back to bed?

32
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,270
Hello? Milady?

33
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,010
Oh my, oh my.

34
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,310
Maria-san.

35
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,510
She went yesterday, so I wonder if she's planning to skip the rest of the semester.

36
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,780
That is what she did last year, after all.

37
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,340
Why does Milady hate school that much?

38
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,520
It's not the school she hates; she hates going outdoors.

39
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,190
As the only daughter of the Sanzenin family, her life was constantly at risk, almost to the point of a daily activity.

40
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:12,540
Any man who approached her was only after her vast assets.

41
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,300
I see. That's how she developed such a difficult character.

42
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:30,080
She's right. Even how I met her was out of need to pay back a hundred fifty million yen.

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,350
But now, I am a butler of this Sanzenin family!

44
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,720
I must protect her so that she can spend her days with a smile!

45
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,090
Um, Hayate-kun, you're voicing your entire monologue.

46
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,390
Hello, this is Sanzenin-

47
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,480
Why hello, it has been a while. How have you been?

48
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,130
Yes, she is here. Please wait a moment.

49
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,890
Nagi, you have a phone call.

50
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,080
Who is it?

51
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,320
Sakuya-san.

52
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,520
From Saku?

53
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,000
Tell her I'm not here.

54
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,970
I cannot; I already told her that you are here.

55
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,970
Oh great.

56
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,270
`ey! Is this Nagi?

57
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,290
*Beep* The number you just dialed is no longer available.

58
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:25,440
After the tone, leave a message,
and you'll find your house in an ocean of fire.

59
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,810
You moron!

60
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,620
Don't hang up on me like that, you fool!

61
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,790
I couldn't speak at all!

62
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,660
Um... You are...

63
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,140
Oops, looks like I gave it too much time in-between the gags.

64
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,070
If I don't do it quicker, no one'll laugh even if it's funny.

65
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,120
All right, we'll have a reflection meeting. You all gather up, too.

66
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,110
Maria-san, I want Earl Grey. Bring some for me, will ya?

67
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,570
Hot! It's seriously hot!

68
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,810
That was boiling water!

69
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,300
If you don't give me something a little cooler,
I can't give any reactions!

70
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,260
You are putting up enough of an reaction, so don't worry.

71
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,040
And while you're at it, die.

72
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,740
That's my future partner. Your jabs are fearsome.

73
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,040
Um, who is she?

74
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,740
Aizawa Sakuya-san.

75
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,820
Daughter of the Aizawa family, a relative of the Sanzenins, and Nagi's childhood friend.

76
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,760
Childhood friend...

77
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,590
So what did you come here for?

78
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,300
Besides, today's a weekday.

79
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,180
Why aren't you at school?

80
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,340
Don't sweat it. Today's my school's establishment day, so it's closed.

81
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,910
That's why I took it as a chance
to come here to check things out.

82
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,050
Check out what?

83
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,040
Your butler.

84
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,520
I heard you're having a blast of a life with
your new butler without even going to school.

85
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,850
So I'm here today to check him out.

86
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,150
To see how funny of a guy he is.

87
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,600
Why do I have to let you check him out?

88
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,280
Besides, if it's Hayate, you already saw him back there.

89
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,740
Huh? Back there?

90
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,380
The new butler...

91
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,480
Is a sculpture?

92
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:15,140
No, scroll the camera a little more to the right.

93
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,340
And you did that on purpose, didn't you?

94
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:24,820
What?! Then that bro standing there
with an empty-looking mind is the new butler?!

95
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,660
Did she come here worrying about Milady?

96
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,050
Such great weather again.

97
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,240
If the weather keeps up, maybe it'll be summer by the time Golden Week ends.

98
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,940
Then before the rainy season starts,
we might start to see the leaves start to change color.

99
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,610
As if, right?

100
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,440
Of course not, you fool!

101
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,020
You think you can get a full effect out of that joke with a self-jab?

102
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,720
Don't mock comedy!

103
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,060
For every gag you make, there has to be a hardcore jab!

104
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,230
Um, any more jabs would probably kill Hayate-kun.

105
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,610
Crap! Have I become a murderer at this age?

106
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,630
Makita! Kunikita! First aid!

107
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,640
Yes, Ma'am.

108
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,160
Wh-What are you doing?!

109
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,730
He's awake.

110
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,650
Good work.

111
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,090
What's your name?

112
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,860
Ayasaki Hayate.

113
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,050
What a boring name.

114
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,060
From today, call yourself Mucho the Soybean Lover.

115
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,270
Don't give my butler a name that sounds like a comedian who's going nowhere!

116
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:53,780
Yes, that's it. Girls with that voice
and twin ponytails have rough jabs.

117
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,570
No clue what you're talking about.

118
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,490
But it's a fact that he has the poorest face of all the butlers Nagi has had.

119
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,130
Looks like the only way out of this is
for me to become his master and form a trio group.

120
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,500
What does it take for you to think in that direction?

121
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,960
A comedic aspect is not needed in a butler.

122
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,760
Wow, so a butler is even expected to be a comedian, eh?

123
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,160
No, not usually.

124
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,470
Ayasaki. Do you know what you lack as a comedian?

125
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:25,970
Huh?

126
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,620
He's a butler!

127
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,880
It's impact!

128
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,780
Impact such as going through your life being chased by villains!

129
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,020
Or getting run over by a car is fine!

130
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:40,330
Or fighting against an unknown robot! That's the impact you're missing!

131
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,830
I've already covered those.

132
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,280
Don't talk back to your master!

133
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,970
Think you're at the pinnacle just because you've become a little popular in this comedy boom?

134
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,110
At that rate, you won't be able to become the second ***-Nai or ******.

135
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,100
M-Maria-san... Could she possibly be...

136
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,200
Like Nagi, she is very stubborn.

137
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:11,770
I-I see. It must be a common trait in their world.

138
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,190
But I'm a butler, too, now.

139
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,110
I've got to come up with something that will convince everyone.

140
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,390
You win, Aizawa-san.

141
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:26,560
I'll show you my best one-shot gag,
so if that's funny, we'll agree that I've surpassed you!

142
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,140
One-shot gag?

143
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,720
Are you sure about that, Hayate?

144
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,940
You're boxing yourself in too much.

145
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,650
Here I go.

146
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,430
You moron! You're mixing things up too much!

147
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:55,830
But I like your challenge spirit.

148
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,360
Looks like you found a good comedian, Nagi.

149
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,140
He's a butler.

150
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,900
With that much challenge spirit, I can count on you, Nagi.

151
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:10,520
Aizawa-san. So you did come here worrying about Milady after all.

152
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,850
So you know, I haven't fully recognized you yet.

153
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,190
We'll start with a thousand one-shot gags!

154
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,750
Yes!

155
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,150
Hey, Hayate!

156
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,340
He doesn't have to take her seriously.

157
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:29,870
But seeing him laugh like that,
Hayate-kun is still only a boy after all.

158
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,270
Shake your butt more!

159
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:39,270
Hey both of you. It's starting to get cold, so let's head back in.

160
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,360
Yeah!

161
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,510
Yes, Milady.

162
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,650
Man, I'm so cold.

163
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,930
Yeah, it became cold all of a sudden.

164
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,100
I was right not to go to school.

165
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,560
What kind of rationalization is that?

166
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,980
It's all because that butler's gags are boring.

167
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,650
Maria, can you get us some tea?

168
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:03,100
Apparently we ran out with that last cup.

169
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:08,740
We have a slight problem now,
since we're expecting a visitor soon, too.

170
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,040
Who's coming?

171
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,170
Isumi.

172
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,580
Hey now... What are you two doing, boycotting the school together?

173
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:21,330
Don't worry. Unlike Wataru, we have good grades, so it's not a problem.

174
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,950
But are you sure it's fine?

175
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,890
Sure about what?

176
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:27,960
We're talking about Isumi-san here.
Maybe she got lost and stranded somewhere again.

177
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:31,830
An errand?

178
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,830
Can you?

179
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,800
To this shop.

180
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:43,410
The money's already paid, and if you tell them you're from the Sanzenins, they will know what brand and how much we want.

181
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,810
Okay! Then I'll be on my way!

182
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,270
Ah, hold on just a moment, Hayate-kun.

183
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:48,750
Yes?

184
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:00,300
When you go out as part of the Sanzenin family, leave with that coat on.

185
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,560
Um, isn't this coat made of cashmere?

186
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,800
Wow, you can tell?

187
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,640
Is it all right for me to wear it? What if I make this expensive-looking coat dirty while outside?

188
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,270
What are you saying, Hayate-kun?

189
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,810
It's not a expensive-looking coat.

190
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,640
It is an expensive coat.

191
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:25,870
Collect a hundred of those, and your debt is easily payable.

192
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,420
So do not  ruin it.

193
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,960
Y-Yes, Sir.

194
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,690
Pachi Pachi Punch!

195
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,000
Chimatsuri wasshoi.

196
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,810
Milady!

197
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,040
Lady Isumi!

198
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,040
Have you found her?

199
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,210
No, she's not over here.

200
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,820
Hey, you guys!

201
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,320
I found this fearsome letter in Milady's room!

202
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,610
What's this?

203
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,210
"I'm visiting Nagi-chan's house."

204
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,890
"I'll be back by dinner."

205
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:58,660
"Isumi."

206
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,430
Oh no! She's gone out alone!

207
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,880
She even gets lost inside the mansion.

208
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:11,700
I heard the Sanzenin Lady was almost kidnapped the other day, too.

209
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,680
Find her!

210
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,560
If she's going to get kidnapped,

211
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,860
we'll gang up on the culprit!

212
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,480
This expensive coat is making me nervous.

213
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,380
Well I'm only off to buy some tea,
so I don't think I'll ruin it or anything.

214
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:36,100
Oh, I'm sorry for dropping paint that won't ever come off if it gets on cashmere.

215
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,220
P-Please be careful.

216
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,560
Watch out!

217
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,560
It's a soba sauce that will never come off if it gets on cashmere!

218
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:49,420
Oh, thank you. That was a close one, young man.

219
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,260
I'm fine, but please be careful.

220
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,900
Oh no!

221
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,940
The car with octopi that squirt ink that won't ever come off if it gets on cashmere!

222
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:12,460
This is bad. I feel dangers all around me as though they're targeted at me.

223
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,600
If I walk through a park without anyone, then I should be fine.

224
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:26,600
Right, it was this park in which I met Lady Nagi.

225
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,010
Yup, right over by that vending machine.

226
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:55,170
The machine is broken.

227
00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:00,680
Um, you need to put money in there, not a talisman.

228
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,410
Oh no.

229
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:03,640
What?

230
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:11,880
I was told by my friend not to talk with strangers, yet I am.

231
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,620
Pardon me.

232
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,170
But don't worry.

233
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:21,960
My friend is a kind person, so I'm sure she'll forgive you.

234
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,710
I see. That's good to know.

235
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:30,270
Hayate's sharp instincts were telling him...

236
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:35,700
...if he gets himself any more involved with her,
he'll end up in a very bad situation.

237
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,050
Excuse me now.

238
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:42,310
At any case, I've become lost in a place like this.

239
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,520
What should I do?

240
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,430
I must run away. I must run away. I must run away.

241
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,700
In order for me to get out of misery, I must run away.

242
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,880
I must run away.

243
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,650
I must run away!

244
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:01,210
If it's fine with you, I'll help you out.

245
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,370
Are you familiar with the area around here?

246
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:11,110
Not very, but if I just left you standing here, I could easily see you getting kidnapped.

247
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:16,080
My friend always tells me that, too.

248
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:23,320
Then, I'd like to accept your kindness and ask for directions.

249
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,290
Please do.

250
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,260
Now where was I going?

251
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,660
There she is!

252
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,160
Who are you?

253
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,770
Hand her over to us.

254
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,540
Who are these suspicious-looking people?

255
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,390
Who is this suspicious-looking boy?

256
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,240
Could they be kidnappers?

257
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,240
Could he be a kidnapper?

258
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,220
We shall slay you with these swords that cut cashmere really well!

259
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,860
Take him down!

260
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,960
Hold on tight.

261
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,890
He's fast.

262
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,060
Um...

263
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:13,670
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

264
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,440
I said don't worry.

265
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,090
But...

266
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,820
What's wrong?

267
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:31,290
I don't see anything below us.

268
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:36,810
A lake that makes cashmere really dirty if you fall in.

269
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,570
Do not  ruin it.

270
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,570
But I can't drop her into the lake.

271
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,310
All right.

272
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,720
A-Are you all right?

273
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,360
Thanks to you.

274
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,150
Wh-What should I do?

275
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,320
The expensive cashmere coat...

276
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,360
It was brand new, and Maria-san told me not to ruin it.

277
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,100
What a careless protagonist.

278
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,980
Shut up!

279
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,680
But what should I do?

280
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,690
First I'll give an honest explanation to Maria-san...

281
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,380
...And get yourself fired.

282
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,670
I said shut up!

283
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,200
What should I do?

284
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,180
U-Um...

285
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,200
I told you to shut u-

286
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,860
U-U-Um...

287
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,790
No, I... I meant...

288
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,710
What do you think of Ul***man?

289
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,900
Um...

290
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,830
I like Be*****.

291
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,140
You will?

292
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:57,620
Yes, since your coat has been ruined because of me.

293
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,080
So, I'd like to compensate you.

294
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:05,490
Thank you. But your thoughts for it are enough.

295
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,480
But...

296
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,820
It's my fault, and although it happened through a series of events, I'm the one that said I'd protect you.

297
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,800
I will protect you from those evil men in black.

298
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,580
Evil men in black?

299
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,880
No, they are-

300
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,140
I know!

301
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:33,030
They're from an evil organization trying to kidnap you, right?

302
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,410
No, um...

303
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:43,290
Don't worry. I know people like them have an information web everywhere, so I won't do anything careless.

304
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,490
No, what I mean is...

305
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:49,260
I may not look it, but I've gone through a lot, too.

306
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,980
So don't worry.

307
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:56,530
If you don't get dry, you'll catch a cold and die.

308
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,720
Thank you.

309
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,090
But I'm fine.

310
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,880
I-I was too late.

311
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,710
No, no. I'm not dead yet.

312
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,420
For now, though, I must take her somewhere safe.

313
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,240
Hey, there is a good place.

314
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,340
This is...

315
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,660
Did it surprise you?

316
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,230
But it's a house of someone I know, so don't worry.

317
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:30,850
The master of the house is a small girl about your age.

318
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,450
A little stubborn and selfish,

319
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,940
she sometimes goes so wild that you can't control her,

320
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,680
but she's very kind and cute.

321
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:49,420
I think I can be good friends with her,
as though I've known her from long ago.

322
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:53,870
But, because of certain reasons,
I can't go in, so the rest is up to you.

323
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,690
Ring and away!

324
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,390
Um...

325
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,430
What will happen to the compensation for the expensive cashmere coat?

326
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,410
The crisis for getting fired is approaching.

327
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:09,070
And a new enemy created by wrong judgment approaches.

328
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:17,220
Next week, along with all the above mentioned,
we'll fight against the symptoms of a fever, as well!

329
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:21,280
Come to think of it, I'm hungry.

330
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,290
Wait!

331
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,650
We must wait until Isumi gets here.

332
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,410
How are you so weak that you've caught a cold all of a sudden?

333
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:09,460
Although it was Nagi's fault for shutting him out, I'm the one originally at fault.

334
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,000
Yes, the final blow was Milady.

335
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:16,860
Fine, then I'll specially cook porridge.

336
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,240
Eh?!

337
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,210
You have a problem with that?

338
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,440
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

339
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,760
You Said You Can See Time,
But That's Probably Your Life Flashing By.

340
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,250
Did she put this in instead of oil?

341
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,410
You will see Time cry.
