1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,990
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,970
It's smaller than expected.

3
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,680
This is small?

4
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,480
It is small.

5
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,550
It'd be small.

6
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,030
Then how big would your "big" be?

7
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,830
And... Is... Is...

8
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:56,470
Is this really Sakuya-san's personal belonging?!

9
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,490
You can see her terrible taste all over the place, can't you?

10
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,880
I was told the cruiser had a very familiar look and size,

11
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,880
but this is really amazing.

12
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,600
Hayate, you aren't thinking...

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,500
This isn't a cruiser. It's the Titanic, no matter how you look at it.

14
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,950
...in your head?

15
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,730
Sakuya-sama is expecting you.

16
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:19,300
Okay.

17
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:19,970
Hayate.

18
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:21,460
Klaus.

19
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,050
Yes, Ma'am.

20
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,240
Let's go, Maria, Klaus.

21
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:27,960
Right behind you.

22
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,000
C-Could you please wait, Milady?!

23
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:37,820
Did you all know that there's a huge mansion like this in the middle of Tokyo?

24
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,880
The name of the mistress who lives there is Sanzenin Nagi.

25
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,750
And...

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,780
Her butler's name is Ayasaki Hayate.

27
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,680
The two are slightly airheaded...

28
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,120
...and they misunderstand each other a bit...

29
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,470
...but they are bound by a tight master-butler bond.

30
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,770
A passionate woman's red cruiser!

31
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,000
Let's go cruiser.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,430
Just like White Bullet, right?

33
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,570
Hey, Hayate.

34
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,460
Yes?

35
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,890
Can you ask me, "Why a ship all of a sudden?"

36
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,710
Eh?

37
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,970
Just ask her for the sake of story development.

38
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,780
Milady, why a ship all of a sudden?

39
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,650
Um, well... You see...

40
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,950
You don't have to answer if you don't want to.

41
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,330
It's because-

42
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,420
She totally wants to answer it.

43
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,750
Hey, Britney...

44
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,550
You mind not clinging to me so much?

45
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,840
I can't believe it...

46
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,290
How could my senpai act like a stranger to me?

47
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,030
But... His distant attitude...

48
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,800
Somehow, it cuts me to the quick.

49
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,180
I get it.

50
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,270
The reason why Hayate doesn't look at me is...

51
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,830
What's important in a relationship is...

52
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,710
It's this!

53
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,540
Distant attitude!

54
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,930
So that's the development this time?

55
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,420
Indeed, in a relationship, rather than being the one chasing...

56
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,860
...the winner is the one who makes the other chase!

57
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,830
That Hon***-sensei once said, too,

58
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,730
"There are times when you learn from the manga you draw."

59
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,140
In that case-

60
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,280
Be ready, Hayate! I will enchant you with my distant attitude towards you!

61
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,150
Ah, Milady.

62
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,210
Hey, Hayate. Good mor-

63
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,420
No! No! What am I doing with a big happy face?

64
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,920
I must talk to him with much more of the attitude of a stranger.

65
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,660
Yeah... Good morning.

66
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,170
Um, Milady?

67
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,720
Wh-Wh-What?

68
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,200
I just noticed that your shoelace is coming loose.

69
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,730
Excuse me.

70
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,880
May I have your foot?

71
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,250
Yeah...

72
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,280
It's all good now, Milady.

73
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,280
Y-Yeah...

74
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,210
Don't let him get away like this!
Blast him with one hard stranger act!

75
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:40,970
Right.

76
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,990
Good work. You may go now.

77
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,410
Geez, that Hayate. He's too good.

78
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,980
Milady! Please don't leave me behind!

79
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,340
Isn't there a situation where Hayate would feel uncomfortable and come to me?

80
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,320
I'm scared!

81
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,340
You're so cute, Hayate.

82
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,730
Nagi, you have a call from Sakuya-san.

83
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,910
I absolutely don't have any time for that, but what did she say?

84
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,150
She's inviting you to a cruise on her cruiser.

85
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,350
That's it!

86
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,990
That was all flashback!

87
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,340
There's no way I can tell this to Hayate.

88
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,430
Let's hurry! Saku's waiting!

89
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,390
Um, what's the answer to the question?

90
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,230
Never mind.

91
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,700
Have a good trip!

92
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,320
Anyways, Sakuya's cruiser has departed.

93
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,820
God, I hate rich people. I hate them.

94
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,110
Wow, so many people are here to send us off.

95
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,710
They're probably just extras.

96
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,700
She's right.

97
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,030
What do you mean by that, Saku?

98
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:46,700
Oh, I get it. So it works like this. Then if I twist it back on...

99
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,810
It fits my character more to have it lively.

100
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,320
Ow!

101
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,990
What a waste of effort.

102
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,490
I'll give them a wave, too.

103
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,190
Stop it.

104
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,460
We have extras aboard, too.

105
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,820
It's the mood that sets things right in places like this.

106
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,300
You even have a band onboard?

107
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,170
Yup.

108
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,870
The one dancing there is an extra, too.

109
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,770
How many non-extras are there, then?

110
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,110
Milady, I searched for you everywhere.

111
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,570
Saku, do you have a female dancer who can dance aggressively?

112
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,020
Yeah, I do. What do you have in mind?

113
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,410
This ship is really big.

114
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,560
I almost got lost.

115
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
May I have a dance with you?

116
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,270
"Dance", right?

117
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:31,260
Yes. I won't allow you to turn down an invitation from a lady.

118
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,770
Milady!

119
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:40,190
What must I do in this case?!

120
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,250
Cruising requires lots of energy, eh, Milady?

121
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:49,480
Why?

122
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,160
Saku. This, that, and that.

123
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,720
I'll give it a try.

124
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,690
Trap C-5. Go.

125
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,860
Milady!

126
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,400
What are you doing?

127
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,000
Giving this ship a rock.

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,730
I don't understand what you're up to, but okay.

129
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,540
Milady, where are you?

130
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,200
Milady!

131
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,300
To the right?!

132
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,170
To the left?!

133
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,180
And to the right again?!

134
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,940
Why do I have to do this?

135
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:33,320
Hayate no... Gotoku... is a... good anime...

136
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,290
Milady!

137
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,570
Milady!

138
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,400
I won't save him.

139
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,530
I won't save him.

140
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,960
I won't save him no matter what.

141
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:53,120
Milady! This is my first experience on a cruiser, so I never knew it would rock this much.

142
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,310
Just as I thought. Hayate's so excited from his first experience on a cruiser.

143
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,880
But, everything is going according to plan.

144
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,450
And-

145
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,900
Ah, that felt good.

146
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,690
What else is there to see, Milady?

147
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,620
This is my chance.

148
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,530
Mila-

149
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,380
Don't ask me everything.

150
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,010
How's that?

151
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:18,690
What is deadly enough?

152
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,300
Have I carved it into him?

153
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:19,980
Did I wedge it in?

154
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,940
Did I smack it right into his heart?

155
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,410
I'm sorry.

156
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,650
Y-You idiot!

157
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,550
D-Don't give me those abandoned puppy dog eyes!

158
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,650
A-Anyway, I'm going to go drink some tea.

159
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,260
If you want to go tour around the ship, go do it yourself!

160
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,500
Milady!

161
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,930
What's the matter, Hayate-kun?

162
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,630
Um, did I do something to upset Milady again?

163
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,230
I'm not sure.

164
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:55,590
Yesterday, it looked like she was struggling to draw her manga like always,

165
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,280
so maybe something came up that she can't be satisfied about.

166
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,780
Something she can't be satisfied about?

167
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:05,180
Oh yeah, Hayate's breakfast this morning was nattou, wasn't it?

168
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,040
Anyway, Saku, this ship is very well-made.

169
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,000
You think?

170
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,520
That's nice.

171
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:19,410
Even if you act cold, I won't fall for you!

172
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,790
Where is this coming from?

173
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,140
Nowhere.

174
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,690
You don't make any sense.

175
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,510
By the way, I was told that you invited Isumi, as well, but...

176
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,070
I bet she's lost.

177
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:31,940
The ship's big, after all.

178
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,960
Where am I?

179
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,180
Just as she thought.

180
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,730
Will this ship be all right?

181
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:38,780
All right how?

182
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,900
The design is very prone to sinking.

183
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,420
You moron!

184
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,430
Listen! "Ti" for Titanic is...

185
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,380
"Ti" is?

186
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,260
Tai de ebi wo tsuru => Ebi de tai wo tsuru = Catch a red sea bream with shrimp.
A proverb meaning to make a big profit out of a small investment.

187
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,170
"Ti" of "Tai de ebi wo tsuru"!

188
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,260
No, it's the other way around.

189
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,090
This ship is so going to sink.

190
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:54,930
This ship had more money invested into it than the movie Titanic had budgeted.

191
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,890
Unless we're raided by terrorists, it won't sink.

192
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,220
Was that gunfire?

193
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,420
Listen, crew members!

194
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,720
We, the Piyo Piyo Terrorists, have taken over this ship!

195
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,040
Be quiet and listen to our demands!

196
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,970
So they say. What are you going to do?

197
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,060
Looks like there are adventurers in this world that don't care about their lives.

198
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,840
Hey, terrorists down there.

199
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,300
What do you want, kid! We have
no business with a midget like you!

200
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,590
So they say. What are you going to do?

201
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,370
Don't touch the crew or the guests.

202
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,650
If you want a hostage, it's to your benefit to have fewer.

203
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,870
Hey, Nagi. You aren't planning on...

204
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,910
What's this? You're nominating yourself as the hostage?

205
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,850
Nah, there's someone better,

206
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,640
namely the owner of this ship.

207
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,470
What? I'm going to become the hostage?

208
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,680
Look how calm she is. She can jab at every foolish little act one makes.

209
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,490
Stop making suggestions!

210
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,230
You fools who don't learn anything from robot animes shall...

211
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,730
Why you...

212
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,400
Wow, this ship really is big.

213
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,640
It's so big, I don't know where I entered from.

214
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,130
But, why is Milady so upset?

215
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,640
And yes~ I'm lost again~

216
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,180
Die Hard At Sea continues.

217
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,830
Detatoko shoubuya.

218
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,830
Detatoko shoubuya = We'll deal when it comes up.

219
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,730
Yamete

220
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,730
Yamete = Stop it.

221
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,420
Terrorists these days...

222
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,770
They think they can win if they fire guns.

223
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,180
They're nowhere close to where they should be.

224
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,910
You need to train more.

225
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,860
Wh-Why are these guys so strong?

226
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,490
Yet, they have gentlemanly attitudes.

227
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,160
Who in the world are you guys?

228
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,450
How foolish of you to come onboard without knowing who we are.

229
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,100
Listen well!

230
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,300
We are those who protect our Ladies.

231
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,800
Professional butlers.

232
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:18,080
Anyone who tries to hurt our Ladies,
we'll do whatever it takes to eradicate them.

233
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,180
Remember that well.

234
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:26,760
Yeah, you may have acted cool and all,
but your blunder of letting them on won't disappear.

235
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:31,240
So, what was their objective?

236
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,890
I don't know. Isumi-san's here, too,
so I can imagine all sorts of reasons for them to be here.

237
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,760
We came on since it looked like lots of rich people are on board.

238
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,970
To pay off our debts!

239
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,300
I don't want my wife and kids to go through any more hardships!

240
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,370
You have wife and kids?

241
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:48,490
Yes, actually I do.

242
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,610
Having a poor life?

243
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,040
Yes...

244
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,350
You got a problem with that?!

245
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,130
Nope.

246
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,770
Wow, he confessed everything.

247
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,490
We don't even see that happening often in Co***.

248
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,940
To explain your entire motive on your own...

249
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,990
Are you a criminal from ******?

250
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,640
Stop making fun of me!

251
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,960
Fine...

252
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,880
I'll put an end to everything!

253
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,990
Th-This is!

254
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,640
A bomb?!

255
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,570
Yup, that's right.

256
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,540
Everything's over!

257
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,640
My debt will disappear along with this ship.

258
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,120
Ready? Go.

259
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,080
Anyone scared?

260
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,570
I am, actually.

261
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,020
Yeah, me, too.

262
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,570
What should we do?!

263
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,900
I guess it is a design flaw.

264
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,370
It's no time to be saying that!

265
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,810
Where are Hayate and Isumi?!

266
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,230
Isumi-sama!

267
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,640
Ow...

268
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,160
Ouch.

269
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,610
What's going on?

270
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,850
Did we crash into an iceberg?

271
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,640
The design of this ship is, you know, it looks like it'll sink if anything were to happen.

272
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,360
You think so, too?

273
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,960
What the heck is this?!

274
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,710
Blood?!

275
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,330
A lot's coming out!

276
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,970
No, no. Calm down.

277
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,350
This is an anime.

278
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,880
In the next cut, it'll be like nothing happened.

279
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,550
Yes, I'm sure that's how the story goes.
I bet the storyboard will follow that, too.

280
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,190
I'm sure the original comic goes-

281
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,780
I guess not.

282
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,850
Wow, that was close.

283
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,340
If I had fallen into this cold water with this amount of blood loss...

284
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:50,620
On average, humans can last in cold water of about 4°C or 5°C for about one hour,

285
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,970
and at 0°C, it's said twenty to thirty minutes is the limit.

286
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,290
I might die.

287
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,670
My condolences.

288
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,170
That's...

289
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,950
Drifting...

290
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:08,510
Drifting with the flow...

291
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,480
Um...

292
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,990
Eh?! Isumi-san?!

293
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,560
What are you doing here?

294
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,950
Because...

295
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,490
Obviously, you're lost, right?

296
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,730
Are you all right?

297
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,160
I'm not all right.

298
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,950
Looks like you're not.

299
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,320
Please hold on. I'll be there soon to help you.

300
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,970
To jump into cold water when your body temperature is low from losing blood means...

301
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,580
...endangering one's life!

302
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,630
You can't find Isumi and Hayate?!

303
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:47,710
Yes. They're the last two we're missing, and all the butlers are panicking!

304
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:51,790
And this ship will probably sink
the way we all know it will in an hour.

305
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,860
"Way we all know it will?"

306
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,560
The way we all know it will.

307
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,430
Crap. Even DiCap*** turned into ocean debris in the end.

308
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,970
Stop saying something so ominous!

309
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,810
No, I'm saying I'm worried about the debt-ridden butler.

310
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:06,700
About Hayate?

311
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,100
Isumi-san is loved by the gods of fortune, so she should be fine,

312
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,580
but on the other hand, he probably has a grim reaper on his back.

313
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,980
I hope he won't do anything rash.

314
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,050
Milady!

315
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,960
Milady!

316
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,330
Milady!

317
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,800
I'll go find Hayate!

318
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,760
Hey!

319
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:37,070
Um, are you all right, Hayate-sama?

320
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,410
Yes, I'm fine. I'm in better shape than DiCap***.

321
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:46,540
Besides, this water was originally so cold that it hurt, but it's starting to feel warm.

322
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,420
I think that means your body's in critical condition.

323
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,470
I'm pretty sturdy, so I should be fine somehow.

324
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,730
But I see you bleeding a lot,

325
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,480
and I see large fish coming, attracted by your blood.

326
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:09,970
No way...

327
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,910
Hayate!

328
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,440
Hayate!

329
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,410
Hayate!

330
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,190
What in the world is going on here?

331
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:38,030
Are you all right... probably not, but... how are you doing, Hayate?

332
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:43,640
L-Let's see... I'd say... I'm in a... really... tight... spot...

333
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,770
Tight spot?! A big crisis, Hayate?

334
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,500
Wh-What should I do...

335
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,630
This fish is a man-eating fish.

336
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:57,150
Even if I want to save Hayate-sama, with him in the mouth...

337
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,550
If I could reach him with this branch...

338
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,160
The situation is totally hopeless.

339
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,760
And if I recall, I think there were two sharks.

340
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,250
If the other one comes right now, then...

341
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,220
...it's really all over.

342
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,000
Hang in there, Hayate.

343
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,370
I'll come... right now...

344
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,470
...and save you!

345
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,250
You mustn't, Milady. There's one more shark.

346
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,580
I have no choice!

347
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:34,990
Don't...

348
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,470
Don't you...

349
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,890
...touch my Milady!

350
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,920
Hayate...

351
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,990
Mi... la... dy...

352
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,680
Hayate!

353
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,150
Oh no...

354
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:14,230
I used up all the energy from that last move, and now I can't even move a finger.

355
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,010
Am I... going to die?

356
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,480
I'm sorry, Milady.

357
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,910
I couldn't be of much help for you.

358
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,500
I'm... really sorry...

359
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,530
So... rry...

360
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,560
If you have the energy to apologize, why don't you wake up already?

361
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,060
Gosh, you're finally awake.

362
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,100
Hayate!

363
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,840
Thank goodness, Haya-

364
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,440
Where is this?

365
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,770
On a rescue boat.

366
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,170
Haya-

367
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,700
You were one big load to carry, you know?

368
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,450
You saved me, Klaus-san?

369
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,300
I only saved you because Milady asked me to.

370
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,240
Haya-

371
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,660
I can't believe a Sanzenin butler would surrender to that.

372
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:08,480
Haya...

373
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:09,830
Haya...

374
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,240
Haya...

375
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,620
I-I'm sorry.

376
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,620
Haya...

377
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:19,000
But... thank you very much for saving me.

378
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,200
Hey, Hayate! Why are you blushing?!

379
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,730
What's with the background?

380
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,130
I don't want to hear "thank you" from you.

381
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:33,500
For some reason, guys tend to like cold attitudes.

382
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,030
As such, Milady's...

383
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,850
You can't! I won't allow it!

384
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,900
What are you talking about, Milady?

385
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,990
...source of anxiety increased.

386
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,700
Next week, we'll fight against anime production schedules.

387
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,300
Let's down some fresh shark fin soup.

388
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,110
It's hot!

389
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,020
Nagi and,

390
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,660
Hayate and,

391
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,320
Katsura sisters'

392
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,490
Butler Network!

393
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,810
I'm the little sister for 100,000,000 people out there, Sanzenin Nagi.

394
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm Ayasaki Hayate.

395
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,240
I'm Katsura Hinagiku.

396
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,080
Erotic terrorists, messages from supernovae, as well as the national beauty, Katsura Yukiji.

397
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,370
When there are four people here, it gets crowded.

398
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:52,690
But if we let Kastura-sensei loose,
things might turn into a mess like the last two times.

399
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:55,300
Ayasaki-kun, you're always harsh on me.

400
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,980
Onee-chan, you're a teacher, so act more like one.

401
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,470
Oh, it's time.

402
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,780
Bye bye.

403
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:05,320
What do you think of this complete version of Magical Destroy?

404
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,360
Um, I don't see much of a difference from before.

405
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:14,130
What? I went and edited it to target the audience for the general public, and yet you still don't understand?

406
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,170
Then I'll use the ultimate way to explain this as easily as possible!

407
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:21,070
Next time, mystery behind the 120% acceptance rate (temp.).

408
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,810
Where are we?

409
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,640
It's where this anime is made, the Syn-

410
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,210
Next time, come to Hayate no Gotoku with Get Setter!
