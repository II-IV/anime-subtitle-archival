1
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:09,370
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:09,990
Got it?

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,810
He's out training again?

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:21,700
He did say he was going to come up with an ultimate move over summer vacation, so I think he's a little under the gun.

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,270
Shirt: Namidabashi

6
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,380
From so early in the morning...

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,140
Is he a sixty-year-old boxer in training?

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,650
I must work hard for Hinagiku-san's sake, too.

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,520
Yup, you're right, for Hinagiku's sake, too-

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,080
Wait.

11
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,380
But how he can put full effort into everything is one of his good attributes.

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,640
It's not good!

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,460
Because summer is about to end,
shouldn't we be spending time together?

14
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,690
Imagine what Ro*** must have felt when he lost Adri**!

15
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,080
Seriously, what's on his mind?

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,100
Milady.

17
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,570
Ayasaki Hayate at your service!

18
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,910
What's this about, Klaus?

19
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,480
I thought I should relieve your loneliness.

20
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,710
And you came up with this prank?

21
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,410
Yes.

22
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,310
Klaus-san, I think your character setting is coming apart.

23
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,130
Like this?

24
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,360
No, I do not mean physically.

25
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,270
Besides, I'm not lonely.

26
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,100
I'm only a little bored.

27
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,970
Well, if you're that bored, why not make a S*S Brigade?

28
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,750
Consider your age; it's not good to mix anime and reality.

29
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,760
GAH!

30
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,940
To be told that by Milady...

31
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,510
I can't live on as a human anymore!

32
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,140
I guess I'll read some manga to pass time.

33
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,380
Study a little!

34
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,060
Mangas: I Love Fishing Sanpei

35
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,560
A butler is one who serves.

36
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,030
A butler is one who dedicates himself.

37
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,920
A butler is a formal guardian who supports the days of their master.

38
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,270
Yes.

39
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:16,050
This is a super combat battle story of a boy who fights, risking his life for a girl.

40
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,570
That was it for my screentime.

41
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,720
By the way, this is Klaus speaking.

42
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,310
What? Milady has?

43
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,130
She looked pretty irritated.

44
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,740
Saying you won't play with her
when summer vacation is coming to an end.

45
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,950
I see.

46
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,310
Yeah, I was too absorbed in my ultimate attack.

47
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,220
So, what is she doing now?

48
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,330
She's reading manga rather than studying, as usual.

49
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,340
Then I'll go right up to her.

50
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,140
That will not be necessary.

51
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,970
Most of the time, after she finishes reading one...

52
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,410
Hayate!

53
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,880
...she gets influenced by it.

54
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,180
Let's go fishing!

55
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,250
Heh?

56
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,010
Lake Sanzenin?

57
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,050
Yeah.

58
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,100
Do you have more than one lake?

59
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,730
Yup.

60
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:41,500
Although they're small ones, about 2 km wide.

61
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,120
Small...

62
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,390
But can you really catch fish in a lake inside the fence?

63
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,360
Of course you can.

64
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,000
It's natural spring water, so the water is really clear.

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,690
Plus her grandfather has transplanted fish from all over the world,

66
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,730
so it has created its own balance.

67
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,710
It's like a cosmos on its own.

68
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,450
It's a very convenient lake where you can decide
what to have for dinner based on what you catch.

69
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,130
Which means...

70
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,450
...you've been catching the fish we eat?

71
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:15,030
I never knew we were aquafarming the fish we eat.

72
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,590
This is a pretty amazing lake!

73
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,440
It is a beautiful place.

74
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,430
We'll catch all we can!

75
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,940
First, it's fly fishing!

76
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,410
Fly fishing? Isn't that challenging?

77
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,710
Don't worry.

78
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,300
In "I Love Fishing, Sanpei", Sanpei-kun was catching one fish after another using flies.

79
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,120
There isn't anything I can't do that Sanpei-kun can.

80
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,940
Milady, it's not good to mix manga and reality.

81
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,960
Tag: Won't let you!

82
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,670
Although this is an anime.

83
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,690
We should start with worms and something with actual bait.

84
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,120
D-Don't be ridiculous.

85
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,000
Fishing with worms is scary.

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,190
Then how about dough balls instead?

87
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:03,370
Fishing starts with catching crucians and comes back to crucians.

88
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,750
Um, are you going to fish, too, Maria-san?

89
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:12,180
Yes. I thought I'd let myself forget about
the menu and enjoy catching crucian carp.

90
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,990
It's making me wonder if the Sanzenin are actually amazing or not.

91
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,170
Let's see...

92
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,290
First of all...

93
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,070
Right, dough ball.

94
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,430
Hayate!

95
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,150
Yes?

96
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,140
There was something huge in the lake!

97
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,120
"Something"?

98
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,710
What is it?

99
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,820
It's probably the lord of this lake!

100
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,780
It has to be!

101
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,700
There you go again.

102
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,880
I'm not lying!

103
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,690
Maria-san, does something like that exist in this lake?

104
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,930
Her eyes are too serious to talk to.

105
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,260
She's scary.

106
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:57,150
Well, it's fine. Hayate, you catch some small fish around the shore.

107
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,750
I'll catch the lord of this lake!

108
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,960
Please do.

109
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,740
Then I'll use the lure.

110
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,880
I need to watch out so Milady won't get tangled in the line and get hurt.

111
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,920
Pop?

112
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,670
Hayate...

113
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,210
The rod went flying out of my hand.

114
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,680
It's dangerous if you don't hold it tight.

115
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,320
Hit.

116
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,770
DAAAHH!

117
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,340
Eh?

118
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:27,890
What?

119
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,130
Not a bad one.

120
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,650
Maria-san, you're fast!

121
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,370
Looks like I have a hit, too.

122
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,970
Look Milady! You can catch a lot from this lake!

123
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,720
Really? Can you really?

124
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,910
All right, I'll do it, too!

125
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,050
Fishing is boring.

126
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,360
That was fast.

127
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,090
It's because the rods fly away!

128
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,980
It's because you don't hold them tight.

129
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,530
Then it might be better to go offshore on a boat.

130
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,240
Boat?

131
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,990
We're all alone, Milady.

132
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,840
I'm so happy, Hayate.

133
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,380
But fly fishing off a boat is hard.

134
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,160
I think it's better to fish from here.

135
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,000
Let's go Hayate!

136
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,370
Milady!

137
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,070
You see, you hold the rod like this.

138
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,000
See, you can cast it properly, right?

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,210
Y-Yeah.

140
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,330
I-I didn't expect Hayate to come so close the moment we were alone.

141
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,160
He's bolder than I'd thought.

142
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,390
If she swings the rod on a boat, she'll definitely fall in,
so I have to make sure to hold her still.

143
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,080
Summer's coming to an end, isn't it?

144
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,710
Y-Y-Yeah.

145
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,510
A lot has happened over the summer, hasn't it?

146
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,870
Like going to the beach class with everyone
and going to the amusement park together.

147
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,870
Y-Yeah.

148
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:27,850
I was planning on coming up with an ultimate move over the summer, but I couldn't in the end.

149
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,540
Even with all your help...

150
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,440
I'm such a failure.

151
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,890
Th-That's not true.

152
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,320
Would you like to set off some fireworks later?

153
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,070
Ones that are cute like you.

154
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:51,120
But I hope you can catch the lake's lord before that.

155
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,850
I really don't mind not catching one...

156
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,980
Milady!

157
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,800
You've got a bite!

158
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,700
Come on, Milady! It's pretty big!

159
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,890
It could be the lord!

160
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,470
Wh-What is this?!

161
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,000
It's dangerous, Milady!

162
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,460
Hayate! Where do you think you're touching!

163
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,770
Milady! Let go of the rod!

164
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,640
You're the one that has to let go!

165
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,840
Are you all right?

166
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,390
We shouldn't have gone out after all.

167
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,410
Since you're small.

168
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,030
Shut up!

169
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,700
Hinagiku's aren't any bigger than mine!

170
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,630
Eh?

171
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,770
Milady?

172
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,380
Anyways, let's get Maria-san and head back.

173
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,690
Like I said.

174
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,660
Fishing starts with catching crucian and comes back to crucian.

175
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,900
Y-Yes.

176
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,870
It's definitely the lord...

177
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,070
So, how did you catch it?

178
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,630
It's classified.

179
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:40,850
For your info, since it couldn't be eaten, they released it.

180
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,880
Dakara hera da'chuuno, hera.

181
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,880
Dakara hera da'chuuno, hera = I told you, it's crucians. Crucians.

182
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,860
Rakki! Cha Cha Cha! Jyanai!

183
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,860
Rakki! Cha Cha Cha! Jyanai! = Lucky, cha-cha-cha! Not at all!

184
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,360
Milady, you have to get changed out of those drenched clothes.

185
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,040
Shut up! It's your fault this happened, you know!

186
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,550
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,070
You should both get in the bath before you catch colds.

188
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,890
I-Idiot! Bathe with Hayate?

189
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,960
How could I possibly do something that embarrassing?

190
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,980
No one said "with Hayate-kun".

191
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,130
What should I do...

192
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,280
I made Milady angry again.

193
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,500
You shouldn't be so depressed.

194
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,000
Let's go get warmed up.

195
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,130
Um, "let's"?

196
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,590
Do you mean get in the bath together?

197
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,000
Huh?

198
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,600
Obviously not.

199
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,170
What is on your mind?

200
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,050
I'm a coward.

201
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,000
Why did I act as though I was rejecting him?

202
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,460
Looks like another event that causes misunderstanding between them happened.

203
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,980
Baths are great.

204
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,550
It's the greatest cultural achievement made by Lilim.

205
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,040
When having a big bath like this to myself,

206
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,150
I forget all the small mistakes.

207
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,310
Well, it'd be best if I could get in with Maria-san.

208
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,790
Could it be Maria-san?

209
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,550
Ma-Maria-san.

210
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,930
You're... so bold...

211
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:50,270
You seem to not like temporary body contact.

212
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,150
Are you afraid of physical contact?

213
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,510
What was that for?!

214
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,460
Shut up!

215
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,210
So, how have things been going recently?

216
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,490
"How?" Nothing special really.

217
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,200
Hey, isn't the water a little lukewarm?

218
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,130
You think so? Isn't this about right?

219
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,620
Nah, it's definitely lukewarm!

220
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,530
I was born in Edo. I need hot water!

221
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,900
Click.

222
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,550
Hey, are you sure about this?

223
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,220
Can you play with this?

224
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,850
Don't worry.

225
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,320
All right, this is it.

226
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,750
Damn, it's hard to press it with pads.

227
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,450
Hey, if you hit it so hard-

228
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,270
What was that sound?

229
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,830
I'll go take a look.

230
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,060
Hayate-kun!

231
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,230
I just heard a really loud sound!

232
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,450
Maria-san?

233
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,310
Crap!

234
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,030
Tama! You!

235
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,750
You plan on getting out of this?

236
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,870
Wait, Tama!

237
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,510
Tama?

238
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,730
Hey, don't run!

239
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,460
Hayate-kun, what's going on?

240
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,930
Um, would you like to use this for now?

241
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,060
Th-Thank you.

242
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,540
I'm done for.

243
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:36,430
Should I apologize to Hayate for acting so cold?

244
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,810
Hayate.

245
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,370
Of all people, Maria-san had to see me like that...

246
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,970
Hey! Hayate!

247
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,030
Hayate?

248
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,250
I CAN NO LONGER LIVE IN THIS MANSION!!!

249
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,050
Maria-san...

250
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,920
What should I do...

251
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,360
Hayate's so depressed because of me.

252
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,600
At this rate, our love will end with the summer!

253
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,720
I must do something!

254
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,690
Hey, debt-ridden butler!

255
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,620
Why do you look so depressed?

256
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,160
You...

257
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:31,740
Don't take it so hard when you're still young.

258
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,700
Whose fault do you think this is?

259
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,040
Then how about an atonement by death?

260
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,840
Isn't there something I can do before dying?

261
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,080
Then how does this sound?

262
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:43,950
First of all, let's fix the bath and the boiler you broke.

263
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,690
Sure, although you're the one who broke it.

264
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,740
What?

265
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,940
Sanzenin's boiler's main power is Aki**?

266
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,600
We're stalking about this mansion's boiler.

267
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,900
It wouldn't be like normal ones.

268
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:09,220
I see signs that indicate we shouldn't be touching anything.

269
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,070
An amateur shouldn't touch anything since everything's dangerous.

270
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,210
I don't want to hear that from a tiger.

271
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,590
Hey, are we sure about this?

272
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,540
Stop blabbing, will ya?

273
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,630
Let's see...

274
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,890
Is someone in here?

275
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,870
Maria-san.

276
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,260
Hayate-kun.

277
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,490
And Tama, as well.

278
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,040
What are you doing here?

279
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,530
Well, I thought about fixing the bath I broke, so I came to the boiler room to start.

280
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,500
And what are you doing here?

281
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,830
That's...

282
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,920
For the same reason as you. I came to fix the bath.

283
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,310
She turned away from me.

284
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:50,210
She probably doesn't even want to see my face.

285
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:54,530
It's hard to look at him because of what happened earlier.

286
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,240
Wh-Wh-Why are you crying, Hayate-kun?

287
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,560
Because... Because I'm...

288
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,900
Ah, this is all getting to be a big bother.

289
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,340
A man shouldn't be crying openly.

290
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,050
This is the boiler, right?

291
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,370
Let's fix this and get out of here.

292
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,610
What?

293
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:19,310
Damn it, pads really make it hard to press stuff.

294
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,480
Maria-san!

295
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,090
Are you all right, Maria-san?

296
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,060
Maria-san!

297
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,250
Hayate-kun.

298
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,630
We'll drown at this rate, so I'll drain the water.

299
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,170
B-But how?

300
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,640
I'm going to borrow this.

301
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,910
If I can put a crack in the wall,
the water pressure should do the rest.

302
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,200
We'll catch that wave.

303
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,600
Hold on tight.

304
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,030
Hayate-kun!

305
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,190
Here we go.

306
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,080
Are you all right, Maria-san?

307
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,790
Y-Yes, I managed.

308
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,750
But...

309
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,760
The boiler room is a mess.

310
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,670
I-I'm sorry.

311
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,210
Package: Firework Set

312
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,200
Hayate!

313
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,870
Hayate! Where are you?

314
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:03,450
This is the only way I can respond to Hayate right now.

315
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,940
But one day, I'll definitely-

316
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,290
I really am no good.

317
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,380
I'm always causing trouble...

318
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,870
Maybe I'm not suited to being a butler.

319
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,870
You really are filled with mystery.

320
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:31,350
You can do anything above average,
yet you cannot do anything perfectly to avoid mistakes.

321
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,230
But how you work so hard on everything...

322
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,030
I really like that.

323
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,640
Thank you very much!

324
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,490
In order to repay your kindness, I'll keep working hard!

325
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,130
But please do fix the bath.

326
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:49,670
Yes!

327
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,570
Then right away!

328
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,000
You don't have to do it right now.

329
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,680
M-Maria-san...

330
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,840
Hayate-kun...

331
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,620
Hayate!

332
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,340
M-Milady.

333
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:23,830
To touch Maria when you already have me...

334
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,340
Is she serious?

335
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,470
You lustful fool!

336
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,640
The debt-ridden butler's summer memories went scattering into the night sky.

337
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,190
And so next week will be a start of a new semester.

338
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:50,120
We'll fight against the student council staff
and the teachers' conspiracy.

339
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,760
Tamaya!

340
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,390
Isumi and...

341
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,160
Nagi and...

342
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,930
Hayate's...

343
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:34,230
Butler Network!

344
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,230
Good morningurt.

345
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,630
I'm Sanzenin Nagi.

346
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:38,950
I'm Ayasaki Hayate.

347
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,670
I am Saginomiya Isumi.

348
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,720
Isumi-san, this song's very soothing.

349
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,900
Hayate-sama.

350
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,300
Hayate, you said the same thing to Maria's song.

351
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,360
Eh? Did I?

352
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,310
Looks like you can't be the MC of this section.

353
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,970
I'm sorry, Milady.

354
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:54,800
Both Nagi and Hayate-sama look like they are enjoying themselves.

355
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,460
So next time, we will have Sakuya-san in this section.

356
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,620
Adios.

357
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,120
Nice to meet you.

358
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,190
I'm Makimura. I'll be your homeroom teacher from today.

359
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,150
What? Why is that nursing robot developer here?

360
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:13,000
Crap, at this rate, my position in Hakuou, in this anime, will be in jeopardy.

361
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,090
Therefore, Ayasaki-kun, I'll have you help me.

362
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:15,820
I refuse.

363
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,800
Next time on Hayate no Gotoku.

364
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,160
A Genius Teacher, Who's Not Small, Appears.

365
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,170
Don't be so depressed, Hayata-kun.

366
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,640
Since, you know, I kind of like being picked on, too.

367
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:28,150
Can you have faith?
