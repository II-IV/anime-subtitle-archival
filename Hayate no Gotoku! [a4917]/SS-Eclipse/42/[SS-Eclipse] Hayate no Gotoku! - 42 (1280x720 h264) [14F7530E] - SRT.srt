1
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:09,950
When watching Hayate no Gotoku, make sure to watch at a good distance away from the TV in a well lit room.

2
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,500
Hayate.

3
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,750
His name will be Hayate.

4
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,740
We shall call him Hayate.

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,580
My, that's a great name.

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,280
Why did you choose that name, though?

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,380
Isn't it obvious?

8
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,320
It's because I want him to become a strong boy who will be able to run away from debt collectors like a gust of wind.

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,320
I see! That's a wonderful name!

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,560
Isn't it? It's because I'm a genius.

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,230
Now we won't have to worry when the day comes when we have to cast away our child and run.

12
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,120
You're amazing, Dear.

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:57,000
This is how the boy named Hayate became fated to obtain ultimate strength from the moment he was born.

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:03,240
Did you all know that there's a huge mansion like this in the middle of Tokyo?

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,890
The name of the mistress who lives there is Sanzenin Nagi.

16
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:06,740
And...

17
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,790
Her butler's name is Ayasaki Hayate.

18
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,730
The two are slightly airheaded...

19
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,210
...and they misunderstand each other a bit...

20
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,210
...but they are bound by a tight master-butler bond.

21
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,560
The entire US population cried!

22
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,230
We'll make you laugh three times in five minutes!

23
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,330
Nothing but despair in getting Academy Awards!

24
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,020
What is this picture?

25
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,970
Isn't it a great portrait?

26
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,610
It is a gift brought to us.

27
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,440
Can you guess how much it is worth?

28
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,300
Open the price!

29
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,950
One... Ten... Hundred... Thousand... Ten thousand... Hundred thousand... Million... Ten million...

30
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,140
Two hundred million yen!

31
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,220
It's petty cash.

32
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,930
Here's the milk tea.

33
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,750
Good work.

34
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:31,170
I'm sure in ten years from now, an autographed illustration of mine will cost a hundred times more than this.

35
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:36,030
Good grief. I guess Milady doesn't understand quality yet.

36
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,430
The quality of the best things!

37
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,560
What did you say?!

38
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,560
What's wrong, Hayate?

39
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,240
This is a fake.

40
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,300
Eh?

41
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,600
Wh-What do you think you're saying?!

42
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,610
Do you understand that this costs more than the debt you have to spend the rest of your life paying?!

43
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,490
Excuse us.

44
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,120
How is it, Sensei?

45
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,690
It is a fake.

46
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,810
We received a call saying that
this might be a fake a little while ago.

47
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,830
Then, excuse us.

48
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,100
SFX: Gahhhhhhhhhhhn

49
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,220
Hey, where are you going?

50
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,020
Yikes!

51
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,840
I was thinking of becoming an artistic statue in the art vault.

52
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,580
B-But, Hayate-kun, you have a great eye for authentication.

53
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,650
How did you know that picture was a fake?

54
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,110
Well, that's because...

55
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,580
You see...

56
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,830
Back when I was little, I used to sell art as my father's assistant.

57
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,590
Oh, your father was an art dealer?

58
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,300
No, not exactly.

59
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,090
You certainly have a great eye!

60
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,500
He first showed a genuine picture.

61
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:54,840
Then, when the customer bought the picture, he gave the picture to me in front of the customer, so they didn't suspect him.

62
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,550
He will be packaging it.

63
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,990
Please hold on just a moment please.

64
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,280
The art would be expensive,
so the customer would be cautious, too,

65
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,150
but they always let their guard down against children.

66
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:11,720
So we sold the fake hidden behind the genuine while I pretended to be packaging it.

67
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,580
That's absolutely a crime!

68
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,900
I was little, so I didn't know that it was a crime.

69
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,040
And I was drilled by my father to be able to authenticate any kind of picture instantaneously.

70
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,910
How much useless information do you have in your head?

71
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,870
Ayasaki Hayate.

72
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,170
This show's main character.

73
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,280
Heroine on some occasions.

74
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,870
Man with an invincible body even though he never defeated the And****** Force.

75
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,690
The author loves World Masterpiece Theater,
so he's developed into a very unfortunate boy.

76
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,670
Excuse me...

77
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,800
Nagi, what have you been reading there?

78
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,510
May I have a moment?

79
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:54,360
Something's been bothering me,
so I'm reading the original work from volume one.

80
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,550
Something bothering you?

81
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:59,450
Please don't take away my narrating job.

82
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,010
You do think Hayate has great abilities, don't you?

83
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,800
Yes, of course.

84
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,740
He's too amazing.

85
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,110
Dexterous but powerful.

86
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,200
Does anything perfectly and quickly.

87
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,620
Over to the next room.

88
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,040
And he even has strange special abilities.

89
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,260
It's a waste to keep him as the main character for a love comedy show that doesn't go anywhere.

90
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,860
But there are times when the situation forces itself to battle.

91
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,180
So here's the question.

92
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,680
Does he have any weaknesses?

93
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,410
Huh?

94
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,400
Weaknesses!

95
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,720
Like mice for Dor***on.

96
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,660
Dogs for Oba*.

97
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,220
Tails for Go**.

98
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,420
Manga or anime main characters usually come with a weakness as a default setting.

99
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,350
Do they?

100
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,950
How do I say... Hayate indeed is amazing,

101
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,240
but has this I-want-to-make-him-cry aura.

102
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,100
Please stop.

103
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,570
I won't deny that.

104
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,130
Right?!

105
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,570
Since you have the same weakness as Robo***, you agree, don't you?

106
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,990
What kind of relation is there to this?

107
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,940
In fact, don't remind me of such a terrible thing!

108
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,440
Therefore, I think Hayate needs a weakness!

109
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,300
Come on! Hinomaru Box!

110
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,780
I prepared things that might be Hayate's weakness in these Hinomaru Boxes.

111
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,690
Then, may I see inside the Ma box?

112
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,430
Okay.

113
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,380
Open the box!

114
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,710
Um, Nagi?

115
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't bring such a creepy thing near me!

116
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,870
Then don't prepare it.

117
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,020
It was our mistake to rely on Psychic **na!

118
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,180
"We"? I didn't.

119
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,490
We must find the weakness through observation.

120
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,320
Good, this is correct, too.

121
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,870
I've finally overcome my weakness in math.

122
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:03,110
Damn. Look, one of Hayate's rare weaknesses has been overcome.

123
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,130
I don't think that's a problem.

124
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,330
Let's observe more to see if there are any other weaknesses.

125
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,840
Oh, take a look.

126
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,720
Milady never eats sardines like this.

127
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,310
I'll mince it up and use ginger to get the smell off.

128
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,900
She's not good with carrots and green peppers, either.

129
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,760
She can't eat anything spicy.

130
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,270
Oh right, she's not good with chicken skin, either, is she?

131
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,560
He's making clear observations of things you're not good with.

132
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:35,030
It's because she has so many likes and dislikes that she doesn't gr-

133
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,370
Damn you!

134
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,730
Damn you, Hayate!

135
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:44,290
Looks like we have to try out common weaknesses.

136
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,240
Huh?

137
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,300
Tada!

138
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,710
How's this? He'd be surprised by this, wouldn't he?

139
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,050
Yes... It's surprising on multiple levels.

140
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,690
There's no one in this world who wouldn't be surprised to see a ghost.

141
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,020
This is a perfect plan.

142
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,450
To be exact, isn't that your weakness?

143
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:04,110
All I have to do now is wait for the night, and while Hayate is asleep...

144
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,950
I don't think you have to wait until dark.

145
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,900
See, all you have to do is make the room dark.

146
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,790
No, Maria...

147
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,960
I-Isn't it still early for this?

148
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,830
You think so?

149
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,240
But if you don't push it,

150
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,980
no one will be afraid.

151
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,050
You don't have to be that afraid.

152
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,320
You've got a long way to go!

153
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,500
That voice is...

154
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,520
Nattou, akadashi, and monjyayaki!

155
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,520
Note: Stereotypical foods people from the Kansai region of Japan don't like.

156
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,520
If it's weaknesses, I've got some, too!

157
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,680
Sakuya-san.

158
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,080
Where did you come from?!

159
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,600
The debt-ridden butler's weaknesses, eh?

160
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,700
All right, leave it to me.

161
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,510
Guys like him usually have unexpected weaknesses.

162
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,670
Something unexpected?

163
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,350
The fearful invaders that almost made humans extinct...

164
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:07,220
However their ambition gets trampled by microbes!

165
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,650
Isn't that an alien's weakness?

166
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,490
I can't leave this in Saku's hands.

167
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,080
What's a good idea...

168
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,850
I have a good idea.

169
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,710
Isumi!

170
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,270
What's your idea?

171
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,670
That's...

172
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,640
...to ask the person himself.

173
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,900
Right, that's a thought.

174
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,010
Eh?

175
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,120
So, what do you fear?

176
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,870
Eh?

177
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,950
Let's see...

178
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,360
A cup of tea. Oh, so fearful.

179
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,830
Those who don't get it, please listen to a comedy titled "Scared of Manju".

180
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,310
Don't try to use something as old as the Edo Period!

181
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,460
Dom PÃ©rignon is scary! Dom PÃ©rignon is scary!

182
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,360
Did something just pass by?

183
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,270
It was your imagination.

184
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,420
Hey, what's your weakness, Isumi-san?

185
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,200
Eh?

186
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,270
I was wondering if the almighty ghost sweeper has something she's afraid of.

187
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,280
Something I'm scared of?

188
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,620
Yes, there is something.

189
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,670
Oh, what is that?

190
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,040
I'm scared of caterpillars.

191
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,820
Caterpillars?

192
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,010
So you're afraid of something very standard.

193
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:27,680
180 m long and weighs 20,000 tons,

194
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,230
it's the deity of Infant Island and makes a large cocoon on Tokyo Tower.

195
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,630
It withstands electro-heat wave attacks.

196
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:40,270
Once it hatches, it causes devastating damage to the world.

197
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:43,470
No wait! That's not exactly a caterpillar!

198
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,890
Laughed enough?

199
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,830
Nekasanaiyo.

200
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,830
Nekasanaiyo. = I won't let you sleep.

201
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,860
Yorokonde.

202
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,860
Yorokonde. = With pleasure.

203
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,630
I'm so full!

204
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,420
Thanks for the meal.

205
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,500
Sorry we had you prepare lunch for us, too.

206
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,140
Not a problem.

207
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,480
You sure picked them out well.

208
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,050
You thought you nailed my weaknesses, but not quite.

209
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:26,360
You'd better watch out, Hayate;
I will soon reveal your weakness.

210
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,810
You still haven't given up?

211
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,150
Maria-san.

212
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,240
When I finish cleaning up, may I take a break?

213
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,470
Yes, that's fine.

214
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,930
What are you planning to do, Hayate?

215
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,220
Just for a bit.

216
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,520
I wanted to continue studying.

217
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,770
The final exam is coming up, too.

218
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,010
Final exam?

219
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:50,380
I need to do well, so I can advance along with you.

220
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,080
With... me...

221
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,130
Y-Yeah, I guess...

222
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:58,890
You two. Don't disturb Hayate's studying, you hear?

223
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,160
You better not try and go find out what his weakness is.

224
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,870
You...

225
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,270
We'll be careful, Nagi.

226
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:12,020
Oh right, I have last year's math exam.

227
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,930
Would you like to look at it as a reference?

228
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,430
Yes, I'd love to!

229
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,810
Um, this is math, but the problems are not in Japanese.

230
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,330
Yeah, it's in German.

231
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,550
What? German?!

232
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,130
Germany would be that country famous for sausages!

233
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,770
Yeah, and also beer.

234
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:33,570
This is beyond the level of calling it hard!

235
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,860
H-Hi, Wataru-kun. Welcome.

236
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,070
We've sure received a lot of guests today.

237
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,170
Why did you come running in and shouting?

238
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,110
What is this exam about?!

239
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,510
Well, Hakuou is a prestigious school after all.

240
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,880
So obviously it's hard.

241
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,740
There is a limit to how hard you can make it!

242
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,350
He's right. There's no way we can read this.

243
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,280
You two can't read it?

244
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,530
Wataru, you even skipped grades, and you can't read German?

245
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,830
Just English is a handful for me.

246
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:17,220
You can choose to take the exam in English.

247
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,240
Um, I'm very iffy with English, too.

248
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,240
By the way, for reference,

249
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,970
what happens if you get a failing grade?

250
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,980
Please don't go quiet there.

251
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,350
What should I do?

252
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,600
It's really hard to be enrolled in a prestigious school.

253
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,940
I'm glad I went to a normal school.

254
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,360
Saku...

255
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,600
Looks like it's the end of the fun.

256
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,460
You guys, good luck with your studies.

257
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,750
Let's go, Isumi-san.

258
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,240
What? Me, too?

259
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,100
Yeah. If you're here, Wataru can't concentrate.

260
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,010
Why can't he?

261
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,340
Saku! You bastard!

262
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,240
Ah, well...

263
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,910
See ya, Nagi.

264
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,350
I'll leave the rest to you.

265
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,690
Let's go, Isumi-san.

266
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,170
Yes...

267
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,730
Oh, fine.

268
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,290
Meanwhile, at a normal high school...

269
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,030
Heh? What's with this quiz score?

270
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,210
Maybe it's a little bad?

271
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:29,800
Many say it's love, relationships, and whatnot and spend highschool living merrily, but high school life is quite rough.

272
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,610
I must study!

273
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,480
That'll do.

274
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,580
What are you doing, Milady?

275
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,890
There is a limit to how much studying you can do alone,

276
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,520
so I was thinking of taking care of my poor little brother.

277
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,000
I see...

278
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,810
I guess there are limits to studying alone.

279
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:51,770
Then I'll-

280
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:56,030
Unlike you, Hayate, he's not someone who can accomplish anything just by putting effort in.

281
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,200
Um, Milady?

282
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,370
I'll go teach Wataru.

283
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,500
I won't forgive you if a Sanzenin butler gets a failing grade.

284
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,590
Yes.

285
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,690
So what are you going to do, Hayate-kun?

286
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,160
Well...

287
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,660
Please teach me, Maria-san!

288
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,660
I knew you were going to do that.

289
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:27,130
Thank you very much.

290
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,690
Gosh, you'd better thank me.

291
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,180
I do.

292
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,100
If you were to drop a grade, I'd feel bad for Saku.

293
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,970
So you'd better work hard.

294
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,810
Y-Yeah.

295
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:44,500
But I didn't know both Wataru-kun
and Isumi-san were skipping grades.

296
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,960
Right, we didn't tell you that, did we?

297
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:54,310
Since we were sure Nagi wouldn't go to school without
her friends around, we asked them to skip grades with her.

298
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,130
They had good grades, too.

299
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:02,210
But originally, Isumi-san and Sakuya-san were supposed to advance.

300
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:08,140
To be honest, Wataru-kun's advancement was rather forceful.

301
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:13,000
There was a reason why Wataru-kun wanted to go to Hakuou badly,

302
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,280
but there were only three seats available for students who can skip grades.

303
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,890
Nagi was the one who taught him then, too.

304
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,550
I see...

305
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,520
They get along well, don't they?

306
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,350
Yes.

307
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:03,170
So, when the small beauty on the Infant Island gets lost,
I'm sure the entire world will fall into a panic.

308
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,560
Enough with that story.

309
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,750
By the way, how's school been recently?

310
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,930
Is it fun?

311
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,270
Yes.

312
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,810
But Nagi won't come to school that often.

313
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,250
Then is Wataru like the only person you hang out with?

314
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,130
Not necessarily.

315
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,350
I only say hi to Wataru-kun every so often.

316
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:28,920
Oh great. I was wondering if there was any progress, and it's this.

317
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,240
Eh? What are you talking about?

318
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,130
Nothing.

319
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,510
So, what happened to King ***ra?

320
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,100
Ah, so King ***ra goes-

321
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,660
But I'm a little worried.

322
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,550
What?

323
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,070
About Milady and Wataru-kun.

324
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,910
Although they are still children,
a young boy and girl are alone in a room.

325
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,920
Oh, come on, Hayate-kun.

326
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,500
It might be wise to bring coffee for them, aiming for the right timing.

327
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,210
You're thinking too much.

328
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:00,890
Besides, if you say a young boy and girl are together, just the two of them, so are we.

329
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,930
The obviously expected love-comedy mode.

330
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,520
Shall we bring coffee to them, after all?

331
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,820
Aiming for the right timing.

332
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,530
I-I agree.

333
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:18,280
Sorry for making you teach me all the time.

334
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,550
What's with the creepy honesty?

335
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,580
Y-You idiot!

336
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,380
I'm always honest!

337
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,010
You'd be cute if you were that honest all the time.

338
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,700
Stop it!

339
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,790
Milady!

340
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,050
We've brought some coffee.

341
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,440
Nice timing!

342
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,000
W-Why are you two holding hands while studying?

343
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,030
It's not what you think, Hayate!

344
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,300
Th-This is from how things turned out!

345
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,620
How things turned out?

346
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,070
What were you going to do?

347
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,670
Nothing!

348
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,460
Yes, Hayate! You got it wrong!

349
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,510
Yeah! I would never think of doing anything to Nagi!

350
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,240
What did you say?

351
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,350
After all, I like Isumi!

352
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,180
Eh?

353
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,900
U-Um...

354
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,390
I got lost while looking for Sakuya, and...

355
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,770
No, Isumi!

356
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,300
This is... um...

357
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,410
Hehe, just a joke.

358
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,480
Oh, it was a joke?

359
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,480
Don't you want to make progress, you wuss?!

360
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,860
There's absolutely no meaning in going to the same school if it's like this.

361
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,600
But you see it now, right?

362
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,320
You don't have to worry about us.

363
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,160
I-It seems so.

364
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,500
Now I can study with Maria-san
without worrying about anything.

365
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,410
You can rest at ease and-

366
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,760
Hold on just a moment.

367
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,870
Do what, did you say?

368
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,830
I said, study with Maria-san.

369
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,880
Study alone with Maria?

370
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,050
How dare you go do that, sneaking around behind my back?

371
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,620
I won't forgive you!

372
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,350
Milady?

373
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,080
Milady, what are you angry about?!

374
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,440
I don't want to hear it!

375
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:21,530
Looks like Hayate-kun's greatest weakness is not being able to understand the minds of girls.

376
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:25,820
And so next week, even the Hollywood movies will be surprised.

377
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,320
We'll fight against large luxury cruisers, terrorists, and sharks.

378
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,810
You've got to Isumize your joke.

379
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,260
No, you mean minimize your joke.

380
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,800
Just kidding!

381
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,690
You really like to make jokes.

382
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,040
Although they're not very funny.

383
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,020
But he's funny as a creature.

384
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,490
Looks like I have to train him.

385
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,790
Katsura Sister's,

386
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,390
Butler Network!

387
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,780
Bang! It's Katsura Yukiji.

388
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,100
B-Bang! It's Katsura Hinagiku.

389
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:43,000
We are the famous pair of beauties, the Katsura Sisters.

390
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,030
Tada!

391
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,810
Was that really right, Onee-chan?

392
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:50,260
I'm working with you since you say it's your chance to be on stage, but it's very embarrassing for me.

393
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,800
Hina, you need to enjoy it more.

394
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,380
We rehearsed so many times yesterday.

395
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,350
When this song sells, we can say goodbye to poverty.

396
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,900
I can drink all the Dom PÃ©rignon I want!

397
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,020
See you next week!

398
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,400
I get it. I see.

399
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,890
The reason why Hayate doesn't look at me...

400
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:06,660
In starting a relationship, you need a cold attitude.

401
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:10,530
Isn't there any situation where Hayate would rely on me?

402
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:13,410
Nagi, Sakuya-san is inviting you on a cruise on her boat.

403
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,600
That's it!

404
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,240
Next time, Poseidon Advance Generator Gavas.

405
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,880
But wow, this ship is well-made.

406
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,490
You think? That's nice.

407
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:24,690
Even if you act cold, I won't fall for you!

408
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:27,410
Next time, just in on Hayate no Gotoku!
