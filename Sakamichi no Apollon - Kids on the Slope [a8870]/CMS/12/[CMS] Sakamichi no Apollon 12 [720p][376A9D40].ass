I'm writing now because there's something I want to tell you, Ritsuko-chan. A friend of mine from back home got married at a church, and in a photo of the ceremony that she sent me, there's a priest who resembles Sentaro-san. I'm not sure of it, but I thought it would be worth looking into. The church is on a small island, so it should be easy to find. I just wrote this postcard to let you know. If you find anything out, please write back.Yours truly,Yukari Fukahori
