I'm writing now because\N there's something I want to tell you, Ritsuko. \NA friend of mine from back home got married at a church, \Nand in a photo of the ceremony that she sent me, there's a priest\N who resembles Sentaro. I'm not sure of it,\N but thought it would be worth looking into.\N The church is on a small island, so it should be easy to find. \NI just wrote this postcard to let you know. \NIf you find anything out, please write back.\N\NYours truly,\NYukari Fukahori
