1
00:01:36,288 --> 00:01:39,022
[glass breaking, explosion]

2
00:01:40,855 --> 00:01:41,688
[grunt]

3
00:01:41,688 --> 00:01:43,222
[glass and metal falling]

4
00:01:48,055 --> 00:01:49,834
[Bradley] A smoke bomb
and a grenade in one.

5
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:52,801
[Bradley] That reckless fool
is beginning to annoy me...

6
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:54,601
Do you think you can
follow their scent?

7
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:56,934
[Gluttony] Uh-huh.

8
00:01:56,934 --> 00:02:03,867
[Winry sobbing]

9
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:06,934
Here officer...

10
00:02:06,934 --> 00:02:10,001
Take her someplace
she'll be safe...

11
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:15,934
Winry... Al is still fighting,
so I have to go... Okay?

12
00:02:15,934 --> 00:02:19,967
[Ed] I'm sorry... When this is
over, I'll explain everything.

13
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:37,734
<i>[Winry] Why... why is waiting
the only thing I can do?</i>

14
00:02:37,734 --> 00:02:39,934
[radio] We have a girl in
custody in Sector Eight

15
00:02:39,934 --> 00:02:42,801
who appears to be a friend
of the Fullmetal Alchemist...

16
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:44,301
Escort her to
Central Command...

17
00:02:44,301 --> 00:02:47,734
Repeat. Sector Eight... We
have a girl in custody

18
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,167
who appears to be a friend
of the Fullmetal Alchemist...

19
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:52,634
[Roy] It's just about time.

20
00:02:52,634 --> 00:02:53,767
Go and back them up.

21
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:54,734
Right.

22
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:01,067
[Roy] There's a vacant
house outside of town...

23
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:04,134
That's where we'll meet
up. Don't be followed.

24
00:03:04,134 --> 00:03:06,001
[Hawkeye] 'Kay.

25
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:08,667
If something goes wrong...
I'll let you know.

26
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:11,234
Alright.

27
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:14,001
[door closing]

28
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:16,001
And sir, please stay
out of the field.

29
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:18,134
I know, Lieutenant. Now go.

30
00:03:18,134 --> 00:03:24,601
[running, heavy breathing]

31
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:26,034
He won't give up.

32
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:32,501
[Ling] This area looks deserted.

33
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:36,234
A dead end. We're trapped.

34
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:39,001
[footsteps]

35
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:40,134
[explosion from far away]

36
00:03:40,134 --> 00:03:41,734
Hm?

37
00:03:41,734 --> 00:03:43,867
Scar again?

38
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:46,267
Gluttony- Go see what
he's up to this time...

39
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:49,267
And I'll take care of our
two little friends here.

40
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:56,734
[running, blood dripping]

41
00:03:56,734 --> 00:03:57,867
What happened to me?...

42
00:03:57,867 --> 00:03:58,567
[Ling] What's wrong?

43
00:03:58,567 --> 00:03:59,401
To my arm?...

44
00:03:59,401 --> 00:04:04,134
My lord... I'm useless
to you now.

45
00:04:04,134 --> 00:04:06,067
What're you talking about?

46
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:08,701
[Lan Fan] You cannot
burden yourself with me...

47
00:04:08,701 --> 00:04:11,101
If you do, they'll
only get you too...

48
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:13,234
A king is no king
without his people,

49
00:04:13,234 --> 00:04:16,667
but a people without their
king would be lost as well.

50
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:18,601
You can't do that to them...

51
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:22,701
My lord, think of our clan...
You must live for their sake.

52
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:25,567
I won't leave you!

53
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:31,834
Sometimes someone must be left
behind. For the greater good.

54
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:36,867
Lan Fan! What are you
planning? No! Don't do it!

55
00:04:36,867 --> 00:04:38,101
[explosion]

56
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:40,601
[screaming]

57
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:50,667
[stone crashing]

58
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:51,934
There's nothing
inside that armor.

59
00:04:51,934 --> 00:04:54,001
You're hollow aren't you?

60
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:55,267
[Scar] You poor boy...

61
00:04:55,267 --> 00:04:57,567
Alchemy trapped you
in that metal prison

62
00:04:57,567 --> 00:04:59,067
and yet you still
have faith in it?

63
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:01,234
[clap, transmutation sounds]

64
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:06,034
[water gushing]

65
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:08,767
[Al] True, there are plenty of
things about this body

66
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:12,167
that are inconvenient.. but it's
nothing I can't live with...

67
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:15,901
[Al] I don't need pity from
anyone... least of all from you.

68
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:19,167
My brother used alchemy
to save my life...

69
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:22,567
To regret the form I have now
would mean not only rejecting

70
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:25,634
alchemy but also turning
my back on him...

71
00:05:25,634 --> 00:05:28,267
I believe in my brother,
and I believe in alchemy.

72
00:05:28,267 --> 00:05:31,034
I will not lose faith...
I want to believe!

73
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:33,767
Oh, do you?

74
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:34,567
[gasp]

75
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,534
[explosion]

76
00:05:37,534 --> 00:05:38,001
[gasp]

77
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:42,867
[Ed yelling]

78
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:45,267
[Al] Brother!...
Where's Winry?

79
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:51,601
She's safe. No thanks to me,
though... I made her cry again.

80
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:56,867
[Al] You really should be
more careful, Brother.

81
00:05:56,867 --> 00:05:59,267
[Al] She doesn't like to
see you fight like that.

82
00:05:59,267 --> 00:06:01,967
Yeah...

83
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:05,034
[Ed] But she's gone
now... Let's end this.

84
00:06:05,034 --> 00:06:07,601
[Gluttony] Oooh! I found you!

85
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,201
[crash]

86
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:12,734
[slobbering] Ishvalan!

87
00:06:12,734 --> 00:06:14,234
You again!

88
00:06:14,234 --> 00:06:15,301
[Al] Look at his tattoo!

89
00:06:15,301 --> 00:06:16,867
A Homunculus!

90
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:20,734
[yelling]

91
00:06:20,734 --> 00:06:30,734
[transmutation sounds]

92
00:06:30,734 --> 00:06:35,601
[crashing and grunting]

93
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:39,701
[hurried footsteps]

94
00:06:39,701 --> 00:06:43,601
[crashing and grunting]

95
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:46,201
[blood dripping]

96
00:06:46,201 --> 00:06:48,701
[explosion]

97
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:53,234
It's Ling!

98
00:06:53,234 --> 00:06:56,734
Go! Move it!

99
00:06:56,734 --> 00:07:03,267
[explosion, blood splattering]

100
00:07:03,267 --> 00:07:13,967
[transmutation sounds]

101
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,267
Get me some strong cable!

102
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:16,967
[Ed] Right!... On it.

103
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:20,101
[transmutation sounds]

104
00:07:20,101 --> 00:07:23,934
Your own regenerative ability's
working against you...

105
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:25,934
Your flesh won't
stop expanding,...

106
00:07:25,934 --> 00:07:29,201
It'll keep you tied
up nice and tight.

107
00:07:29,201 --> 00:07:32,701
You're mine now... Homunculus!

108
00:07:38,034 --> 00:07:42,934
[dog whimpering]

109
00:07:42,934 --> 00:07:45,167
That was well played, girl.

110
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:56,601
I.. beat you...

111
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,634
How does it feel
to be tricked?...

112
00:07:58,634 --> 00:08:00,934
You lose this round.

113
00:08:00,934 --> 00:08:03,901
<i>[Scar] What?...
That thing is a Homunculus?</i>

114
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,667
[engine revving]

115
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:07,134
[gunshots]

116
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:08,034
[grunting in pain]

117
00:08:08,034 --> 00:08:13,167
[brakes squealing]

118
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:17,601
Put him in. We're
getting out of here.

119
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:19,767
[shocked yells]

120
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:23,634
[yelling with effort]

121
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:29,667
Hold on a sec, Lieute--

122
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:31,867
Shh!

123
00:08:31,867 --> 00:08:33,734
[engine revving]

124
00:08:33,734 --> 00:08:34,801
[Al] Wait! What's going on--

125
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:37,734
[Ed] Al!

126
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:41,134
The MPs are watching... Just
pretend we don't know her.

127
00:08:41,134 --> 00:08:43,234
[Soldier] They're getting
away!... After them!

128
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:44,067
[MPs] Right!

129
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,201
The colonel may be a
creep and a jerk,

130
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:49,501
but at least we can trust him...
We have something to do.

131
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:59,867
[crash, transmutation sounds]

132
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:01,267
[Ed] We have to get him Al!

133
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:01,934
[Al affirmative grunt]

134
00:09:01,934 --> 00:09:03,034
[clap, transmutation sounds]

135
00:09:03,034 --> 00:09:06,267
You killed the Rockbells and
Nina, among many others.

136
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:08,601
[Al] You're going to answer
for your crimes!

137
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:18,267
[crashing, grunting]

138
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:21,167
Are these two giving you
trouble, servant?

139
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:23,601
This is the servant of the
man who saved my life.

140
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:26,001
You better leave him
alone, puny little boy!

141
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:28,567
Wait a sec!.. Who
you calling puny?!

142
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,767
[MPs] Where'd that
kid come from?

143
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:33,867
[MPs] Get away, girl...
It's dangerous!

144
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:37,967
They've got us outnumbered...
It's time for us to retreat.

145
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:45,967
[transmutation sounds]

146
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:47,801
[explosions]

147
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:56,567
[yelling, coughing]

148
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:58,834
[coughing] What kind
of alchemy was that?

149
00:09:58,834 --> 00:10:01,001
[Al] She did it from
that far away?

150
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:05,601
Here, follow me.

151
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:09,934
I can't see! Scar!

152
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:13,634
[honking]

153
00:10:13,634 --> 00:10:15,134
I know who you are,
Ling Yao...

154
00:10:15,134 --> 00:10:18,801
Don't worry... We're on our
way to a secure safe house.

155
00:10:18,801 --> 00:10:21,667
My friend... I left her
behind!... Go get her!

156
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:24,601
What?... No, we can't.
We don't have time.

157
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:27,134
Make time!... She
could be dying now...

158
00:10:27,134 --> 00:10:31,001
She's still waiting
there for me!

159
00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:32,634
You had better make it quick.

160
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:38,701
[honking]

161
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:47,067
[Bradley] That woman driving...

162
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:49,534
<i>I'm sure she's Mustang's.</i>

163
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:55,701
<i>I'm tired of playing
games with that upstart.</i>

164
00:11:02,901 --> 00:11:04,735
<i>[Narrator]
Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

165
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:10,935
[transmutation sounds]

166
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:17,661
<i>[Scar] Her eyes... Is
that how mine looked?</i>

167
00:11:17,661 --> 00:11:25,494
<i>No matter what I do...
Hatred only breeds more hatred.</i>

168
00:11:25,494 --> 00:11:29,228
There you go. I think I
managed to stop the bleeding.

169
00:11:29,228 --> 00:11:33,361
Thank you.

170
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:36,361
Sir!... The MPs are all
closing in on us...

171
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:37,761
We need to get going!

172
00:11:37,761 --> 00:11:39,361
[Soldier] He took
a shot to the leg.

173
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:41,461
In his condition, he
couldn't have gotten far.

174
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:43,361
Comb the area for him!

175
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:44,294
Sir!

176
00:11:44,294 --> 00:11:46,894
[Yoki whispering]
Quickly, sir, quickly!

177
00:11:46,894 --> 00:11:50,328
Shao May, where are you?

178
00:11:50,328 --> 00:11:52,761
Oh no!

179
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:54,628
[Al] Look what I found, Ed.

180
00:11:57,894 --> 00:12:00,761
We're a little busy right now to
be adopting panda bears, Al!

181
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:01,894
[Al] I couldn't
leave her alone

182
00:12:01,894 --> 00:12:04,228
in the middle of all
that mess back there!

183
00:12:04,228 --> 00:12:06,861
First stray cats, and now
this?!.. Just how many animals

184
00:12:06,861 --> 00:12:09,761
can you stuff into that armor of
yours, huh?!.. Get rid of it!

185
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:11,628
[Al] What a heartless
thing to say!

186
00:12:11,628 --> 00:12:14,828
[Al] Look how sweet
and gentle she is!

187
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:18,361
[chomp]

188
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:20,261
[Al chuckling] It's all
right... You're safe now.

189
00:12:24,528 --> 00:12:24,961
[clang]

190
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:26,761
[shocked yelling]

191
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,461
[MP] This way... follow me.

192
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:37,161
[Ed] Thanks.

193
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:40,194
[Al] You can stay
in here, okay?

194
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:46,828
[excited gasp]

195
00:12:46,828 --> 00:12:51,328
Hey! Winry!

196
00:12:51,328 --> 00:12:55,228
Oh... hello there,
Fullmetal Alchemist.

197
00:12:55,228 --> 00:12:57,194
Fuhrer Bradley.
This is a surprise.

198
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:58,828
[Al] What brings you here?...

199
00:12:58,828 --> 00:13:00,928
I heard that a childhood
friend of yours was under

200
00:13:00,928 --> 00:13:04,294
our protection here at
the Command Center...

201
00:13:04,294 --> 00:13:06,561
As a friend of such an
important alchemist...

202
00:13:06,561 --> 00:13:10,894
[Bradley] she deserves
our every courtesy.

203
00:13:10,894 --> 00:13:14,828
I should be on my way now... If
you'll please excuse me, miss.

204
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:17,661
Oh.. of course... sir.

205
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:23,328
That's a nice, honest
friend you've got there...

206
00:13:23,328 --> 00:13:26,628
Make sure you both take
good care of her.

207
00:13:34,194 --> 00:13:36,794
[Winry] Ed...

208
00:13:36,794 --> 00:13:41,394
You promised... Tell me
everything about my parents...

209
00:13:41,394 --> 00:13:43,128
What happened to them?

210
00:13:53,228 --> 00:13:55,261
<i>[Winry] I see...</i>

211
00:13:55,261 --> 00:13:57,394
<i>They did everything they
could to help others..</i>

212
00:13:57,394 --> 00:14:00,928
<i>Right up until the end.</i>

213
00:14:00,928 --> 00:14:04,861
But I... I just wish they could
have come back to me alive.

214
00:14:04,861 --> 00:14:08,894
Is that selfish?

215
00:14:08,894 --> 00:14:13,394
<i>More waiting... That's
all I can ever do.</i>

216
00:14:27,661 --> 00:14:29,628
[front desk] Ah!...
Perfect timing!...

217
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:33,228
Miss Rockbell,..there's a
telephone call for you.

218
00:14:33,228 --> 00:14:37,361
For me?

219
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:40,728
Yes, hello?... Oh, Mr. Garfiel!

220
00:14:40,728 --> 00:14:42,461
[Garfiel] I'm sorry
about this, Winry.

221
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:44,228
I know you've got
a lot going on

222
00:14:44,228 --> 00:14:46,494
and I tried to handle
it myself, really.

223
00:14:46,494 --> 00:14:48,628
[crowd] Where is she?
Isn't Winry back yet?

224
00:14:48,628 --> 00:14:50,728
Look at this! Winry's the
only one who can fix it!

225
00:14:50,728 --> 00:14:52,461
[Garfiel] ...but I can't
take this anymore.

226
00:14:52,461 --> 00:14:54,494
Your customers are so needy!

227
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:58,194
[crowd] Please hurry back,
Winry! We miss you!

228
00:14:58,194 --> 00:14:59,661
[Tetsu] You there, Miss Winry?

229
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:00,928
Tetsu?

230
00:15:00,928 --> 00:15:02,761
[Tetsu] Please come back
to the shop soon...

231
00:15:02,761 --> 00:15:06,528
You do a much better job working
on my leg than Mr. Garfiel can!

232
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:08,428
We need you here!

233
00:15:08,428 --> 00:15:11,228
Another thing, Winry.. We
still need an outer covering

234
00:15:11,228 --> 00:15:13,294
for that model leg
you made for me.

235
00:15:13,294 --> 00:15:14,261
My arm needs work too!

236
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:15,894
Hey, hold on a sec.
I was first!

237
00:15:15,894 --> 00:15:16,894
[crowd] I miss you, Winry!

238
00:15:16,894 --> 00:15:20,328
You idiot, of course you
miss her!... We all do.

239
00:15:20,328 --> 00:15:22,328
Isn't that the truth!

240
00:15:22,328 --> 00:15:26,328
I'm sorry... I'll be
back home soon.

241
00:15:26,328 --> 00:15:30,194
[Winry] Just hold on...
I won't be much longer...

242
00:15:30,194 --> 00:15:33,694
I'll help everyone...
Thank you all.

243
00:15:40,894 --> 00:15:43,394
[train whistle]

244
00:15:43,394 --> 00:15:47,761
[Winry] Thank you both...
for stopping me back there.

245
00:15:47,761 --> 00:15:51,561
I forgot there were still
people who depended on me...

246
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:52,594
If I had done it...

247
00:15:52,594 --> 00:15:56,528
I wouldn't have been able
to face them again.

248
00:15:56,528 --> 00:15:59,694
[Al] Of course.

249
00:15:59,694 --> 00:16:02,428
I expect you to take good
care of your automail!

250
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,761
Yep.

251
00:16:03,761 --> 00:16:06,661
Oh, and I'll send you some
good polishing oil soon, Al.

252
00:16:06,661 --> 00:16:10,261
[Al] Great!

253
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,694
And no dying, okay?

254
00:16:12,694 --> 00:16:15,161
Right.

255
00:16:15,161 --> 00:16:16,061
Oh, and...

256
00:16:16,061 --> 00:16:18,294
the next time I make
you cry, I hope...

257
00:16:18,294 --> 00:16:20,261
[bell ringing loudly]

258
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:23,761
Wha?...What?... I
can't hear you!

259
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:29,228
[Al] Brother?...Wait
up!... See ya, Winry!

260
00:16:29,228 --> 00:16:35,628
Oh..kay. Geez... Come back,
Edward! What were you saying?!

261
00:16:39,628 --> 00:16:42,928
The next time I make you cry, I
hope they'll be tears of joy!

262
00:16:42,928 --> 00:16:45,428
And Al and I will be back in
our normal bodies,

263
00:16:45,428 --> 00:16:47,928
[Ed] and I'll make you cry
out of sheer happiness!

264
00:16:47,928 --> 00:16:50,661
That's a promise!

265
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:52,494
[laughing]

266
00:16:52,494 --> 00:16:54,794
[train whistle]

267
00:17:03,728 --> 00:17:08,428
Give me a new arm and a leg.
I need one year!

268
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:12,461
Well... there's no turning
back for us now, brother.

269
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:17,461
<i>[Ed] What are you
crying for, Winry?</i>

270
00:17:36,594 --> 00:17:42,328
<i>[Winry] All this time, have
I been... falling for him?</i>

271
00:17:46,051 --> 00:17:50,984
[car engine, brakes squealing]

272
00:17:50,984 --> 00:17:52,251
[Ed] Colonel?

273
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:53,818
Get in the car.

274
00:18:02,454 --> 00:18:03,721
[Roy] Someone's
badly injured.

275
00:18:03,721 --> 00:18:06,454
I came to you because
we need a doctor.

276
00:18:06,454 --> 00:18:08,821
[Knox] Got yourself
in trouble again...

277
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,687
Just can't help yourself.

278
00:18:10,687 --> 00:18:11,721
I know you have a family.

279
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:13,687
I wouldn't want to
endanger them...

280
00:18:13,687 --> 00:18:17,287
If you'd rather not get
involved, I'll understand.

281
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:20,021
[Knox] Wait here...
I'll get my instruments.

282
00:18:20,021 --> 00:18:22,921
Are you sure about this?

283
00:18:22,921 --> 00:18:24,587
My wife and I split up

284
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:27,654
not long after I came back
from duty in Ishval.

285
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:31,521
[Knox] You let her
wander around the sewers

286
00:18:31,521 --> 00:18:35,721
with her arm cut off?!... Don't
blame me if she gets lockjaw!

287
00:18:35,721 --> 00:18:37,421
[Lan Fan groaning in pain]

288
00:18:37,421 --> 00:18:39,921
I'm afraid, the only
patients I've had lately

289
00:18:39,921 --> 00:18:43,821
have been corpses... so this
might be a little rough.

290
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:45,887
[screaming through gag]

291
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:49,987
[whimpering from other room]

292
00:18:49,987 --> 00:18:50,787
I'm sorry.

293
00:18:50,787 --> 00:18:53,487
No, Don't apologize.

294
00:18:53,487 --> 00:18:56,287
I'm the one who
suggested it, remember?

295
00:18:56,287 --> 00:18:59,821
We both had something to gain
out of it, so it made sense...

296
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:02,387
When I went in search
of immortality...

297
00:19:02,387 --> 00:19:08,254
I knew I must be ready to
make certain sacrifices.

298
00:19:08,254 --> 00:19:13,754
[Ling] But I... I wasn't
ready for this...

299
00:19:13,754 --> 00:19:14,821
Lan Fan was though.

300
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:18,221
She made the decision that
I was too weak to make.

301
00:19:25,054 --> 00:19:25,887
[Al] She's awake!

302
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:29,887
You okay?...is there
anything we can do?

303
00:19:29,887 --> 00:19:33,754
That old trap of yours...
worked pretty well.

304
00:19:36,054 --> 00:19:38,887
But I'm useless
without my arm...

305
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:43,854
I'm going to need to
find a replacement.

306
00:19:43,854 --> 00:19:47,954
You know... I can introduce
you to a great engineer.

307
00:19:50,887 --> 00:19:54,921
[footsteps]

308
00:19:54,921 --> 00:20:00,521
I'm with the State Military...
Name's Colonel Roy Mustang.

309
00:20:00,521 --> 00:20:02,387
And my name is Ling Yao,

310
00:20:02,387 --> 00:20:04,654
the twelfth son of
the Emperor of Xing.

311
00:20:04,654 --> 00:20:07,287
I appreciate you
finding a doctor.

312
00:20:07,287 --> 00:20:08,554
It was no problem.

313
00:20:08,554 --> 00:20:10,921
Thank you for helping us
with the Ross incident...

314
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:12,854
And also...

315
00:20:12,854 --> 00:20:15,254
[Roy] for bringing
this thing in.

316
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:21,921
[Knox] Hey, what
do we have here?

317
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:26,721
[Ling] That's Gluttony...
He's a Homunculus.

318
00:20:26,721 --> 00:20:28,954
He and his friends appear
to be have connections

319
00:20:28,954 --> 00:20:32,321
among some of the
military's senior staff.

320
00:20:32,321 --> 00:20:36,321
Just some, you say?.. It
goes far deeper than that.

321
00:20:36,321 --> 00:20:37,887
Your Fuhrer, King Bradley...

322
00:20:37,887 --> 00:20:40,721
I believe it's possible
that he's a Homunculus too.

323
00:20:40,721 --> 00:20:42,321
[gasps]

324
00:20:42,321 --> 00:20:44,854
I saw his eye.. The
one under the patch.

325
00:20:44,854 --> 00:20:46,721
It had an Uroboros tattoo...

326
00:20:46,721 --> 00:20:49,854
He and Gluttony came after us,
and they were working together!

327
00:20:49,854 --> 00:20:50,887
No way!

328
00:20:50,887 --> 00:20:53,887
[Al] Our ruler.. a Homunculus?!

329
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:57,587
Although... Bradley doesn't
have the same sort

330
00:20:57,587 --> 00:21:00,554
of inhuman presence that
you get from Gluttony...

331
00:21:00,554 --> 00:21:03,354
At his core, he still feels
like a regular person.

332
00:21:03,354 --> 00:21:06,254
[Al] Another thing... If the
Fuhrer is a Homunculus,

333
00:21:06,254 --> 00:21:09,454
how can he possibly have a
son?... It said in that book

334
00:21:09,454 --> 00:21:12,321
that the Homunculi have no
reproductive capabilities.

335
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:15,787
[Knox] No... The Fuhrer's
son, Selim, is adopted...

336
00:21:15,787 --> 00:21:19,487
There's no direct blood relation
between him and his father.

337
00:21:23,521 --> 00:21:25,687
Whether he's monster
or human...

338
00:21:25,687 --> 00:21:27,587
either way, these new
developments will make it

339
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:30,921
easier to remove him
from the seat of power.

340
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:33,321
First, we get information
out of this one...

341
00:21:33,321 --> 00:21:35,321
and I'll take his stone...

342
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:37,921
It may prove useful
in treating my man.

343
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:41,487
Hey, you! Lan Fan lost
her arm to get him.

344
00:21:41,487 --> 00:21:43,954
[Ling] He's our captive! We're
taking him back to Xing!

345
00:21:43,954 --> 00:21:46,721
[Ed] Hold it! He could help
us get our bodies back!

346
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:48,921
We've been working on
that for a long time.

347
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:50,721
I'm not going to let you
just waltz off with him!

348
00:21:50,721 --> 00:21:51,721
[Roy] That's right!

349
00:21:51,721 --> 00:21:54,987
Think about it, Ling!
You're an illegal alien.

350
00:21:54,987 --> 00:21:56,721
[Knox] I'm too old
for this kinda thing...

351
00:21:56,721 --> 00:21:59,921
Good luck, Mustang...
I'm going home.

352
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:02,354
Colonel Mustang.

353
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,721
Mustang was one
who killed Lust!...

354
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:07,754
Mustang must pay for
what he did to her!

355
00:22:07,754 --> 00:22:15,454
[cables straining,
Gluttony grunting]

356
00:22:15,454 --> 00:22:19,521
[Gluttony] Roy Mustang!

357
00:22:23,354 --> 00:22:24,421
[Shao May whimpering]

358
00:22:26,521 --> 00:22:29,854
[explosion]

359
00:22:29,854 --> 00:22:31,587
What was that?!

360
00:24:04,587 --> 00:24:07,787
<i>[Narrator] What lies safely
hidden behind lying eyes...</i>

361
00:24:07,787 --> 00:24:10,921
<i>behind fake smiles and
feigned friendship?</i>

362
00:24:10,921 --> 00:24:13,821
<i>Finding out will
be no easy task...</i>

363
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:18,554
<i>Enter the forest... Grope in
the darkness for the unknown.</i>

364
00:24:18,554 --> 00:24:21,987
<i>Next time on Fullmetal
Alchemist: Brotherhood.</i>

365
00:24:21,987 --> 00:24:26,254
Episode 24... Inside the Belly.

366
00:24:26,254 --> 00:24:27,887
<i>If you move carelessly...</i>

367
00:24:27,887 --> 00:24:31,887
<i>nothing but pain will await
you in the inky blackness.</i>
