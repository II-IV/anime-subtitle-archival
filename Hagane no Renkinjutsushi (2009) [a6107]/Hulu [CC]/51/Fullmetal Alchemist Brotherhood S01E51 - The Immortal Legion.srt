00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:05,609
So you were saying

8
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:07,643
that the tests
aren't done yet...?

9
00:02:07,643 --> 00:02:09,476
Well then, here is your test...

10
00:02:09,476 --> 00:02:11,576
I'd say it's successful!

And now...

20
00:02:30,043 --> 00:02:32,276
I want you to listen closely...

21
00:02:32,276 --> 00:02:34,643
there are many
renegade elements...

22
00:02:34,643 --> 00:02:37,276
And they want to take us over.

The air here seems foul.

Yeah.

Damn this stupid thing!

00:04:15,543 --> 00:04:17,809
How do you open this?!

39
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:21,543
Stand back.

00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:28,543
Oh...! Its open... huh?!

41
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:44,443
Order the Central

42
00:04:44,443 --> 00:04:47,476
with Mustang and the
Briggs men to pull back.

43
00:04:51,676 --> 00:04:54,743
What...? You're going to shoot?

44
00:04:58,976 --> 00:05:01,543
Your subordinates are
lacking in discipline.

Pull your forces back now...

00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:11,409
My Briggs men will not
hesitate to wipe them out...

You don't want to lose
all of your troops, do you?

48
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:28,376
Close all the gates...!

Don't let them in...!

No Briggs soldier or Mustang!

have some mettle,

to kill you...

00:06:13,643 --> 00:06:16,376

You have my gratitude!

we can really show our stuff.

to create these monsters?

we'll just have to

Seal off the main roads!

The vehicle is disguised
as a civilian truck,

108
00:08:56,876 --> 00:08:58,309
but it's loaded with weapons...

109

It looks like

No! I didn't lie to you!

What are these

Do you think they're
gonna evict us?

162
00:13:45,478 --> 00:13:46,744
But what would we do?

163
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:50,411
There's no other place
that we could go to.

164
00:13:50,411 --> 00:13:51,678
[YOKI]
W-What's happening...?

165
00:13:51,678 --> 00:13:54,778
Do you think they caught
wind of where we are?

166
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:57,744
Not good. We have to tell Al--

167
00:13:57,744 --> 00:13:59,744
Wait, please hold on!

We can't just sit
here and do nothing!

172
00:14:07,744 --> 00:14:09,711
Just calm down.

173
00:14:09,711 --> 00:14:10,578
Think about it.

00:14:10,578 --> 00:14:11,644
If you're taken
prisoner or something,

175
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:15,744
it's just going to be that
much harder on Alphonse!

See what I'm saying?

177
00:14:16,844 --> 00:14:17,644
We can't afford...

Ah, so you're alone, then...?

Gluttony was out here

00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,144
with you as well.

183
00:14:40,144 --> 00:14:43,611
Yes, well, in the end
I had to consume him.

184
00:14:43,611 --> 00:14:45,644
You ate Gluttony?

185
00:14:45,644 --> 00:14:46,944
Your own kind?

186
00:14:46,944 --> 00:14:49,078
It's not like it's
cannibalism...

187
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:51,811
We are a collective.

188
00:14:51,811 --> 00:14:55,478
We were both born
of the same father.

189
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:58,444
And now we've gone
back to being one form.

190
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:01,844
[KIMBLEE]
So that's how it works, huh?

191
00:15:01,844 --> 00:15:08,411
[AL]
Mr. Heinkel!

192
00:15:08,411 --> 00:15:10,044
Oh... Still alive?

193
00:15:10,044 --> 00:15:12,011
What a pity for you.

194
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,778
But then, you
are a chimera...

195
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:17,878
The life force
is strong in you.

196
00:15:17,878 --> 00:15:21,744
[AL]
Mr. Heinkel!

197
00:15:21,744 --> 00:15:25,544
Damn it! Let me go!

198
00:15:25,544 --> 00:15:28,111
You're not going anywhere.

199
00:15:28,111 --> 00:15:30,444
[AL]
Why... you...

200
00:15:38,778 --> 00:15:40,778
Why bother fighting?

201
00:15:51,044 --> 00:15:52,978
Crash!!

202
00:15:56,611 --> 00:15:59,511
Why bother running?

203
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:11,011
What's that?

204
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:11,911
Hmph...

205
00:16:11,911 --> 00:16:14,144
I should've known
that wouldn't work.

206
00:16:14,144 --> 00:16:18,411
[OFFICER 6] That's far
enough, General Armstrong!

207
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:19,178
We have our orders,

208
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,611
and we're prepared
to shoot you

209
00:16:20,611 --> 00:16:22,911
for the traitor you are!

210
00:16:24,711 --> 00:16:27,378
Take aim, men...! Fire!

211
00:16:30,011 --> 00:16:31,444
You idiot!

212
00:16:31,444 --> 00:16:33,511
You shouldn't have
concentrated your men!

213
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,704
<i>[thinking] Please tell me
that at least did something!</i>

214
00:16:57,554 --> 00:17:02,443
Hey, look... I... caught you.

215
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:05,943
And this time...
I won't mess... up.

216
00:17:09,955 --> 00:17:15,189
Must kill her...
the woman general.

217
00:17:24,989 --> 00:17:30,389
Hello, Sister...!
Are you all right?

218
00:17:33,955 --> 00:17:37,122
Who do you think I am...?
Of course I'm all right!

219
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,922
I'm just glad to see
that you're okay...

220
00:17:39,922 --> 00:17:42,022
Now then, could you tell me...

221
00:17:42,022 --> 00:17:44,622
what the hell that is?

222
00:17:44,622 --> 00:17:46,222
[OLIVIER]
A Homunculus...

223
00:17:46,222 --> 00:17:48,655
Bullets don't work on him.

224
00:17:48,655 --> 00:17:51,389
Maybe if we had
some heavy artillery...

225
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:53,389
You don't say...

226
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:57,689
Fortunately, dear sister,
that is my specialty...

227
00:17:57,689 --> 00:18:00,622
Why don't you let your
brother have a crack at it...?

228
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:04,389
I'll take this atrocity down.

229
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:06,355
Come on... you monster!

230
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:20,122
What a... pain...

231
00:18:20,122 --> 00:18:22,655
Just leave me...
Get out of here.

232
00:18:22,655 --> 00:18:26,355
Listen to me...!
Go...! Quickly!

233
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,355
[AL]
No way!

234
00:18:27,355 --> 00:18:29,122
Don't talk back to me...!

235
00:18:29,122 --> 00:18:32,489
At this rate, we'll both die.

236
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:34,089
Leave me behind...

237
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:36,622
You might be able
to save yourself!

238
00:18:36,622 --> 00:18:39,255
[AL]
I told you--not happening!

239
00:18:39,255 --> 00:18:41,955
Now think about
something useful instead...

240
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,455
Like staying alive!

241
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,522
[HEINKEL]
You dumbass!

242
00:18:45,522 --> 00:18:46,989
Think about it...

243
00:18:46,989 --> 00:18:50,155
We're facing
Kimblee and Pride both.

244
00:18:53,355 --> 00:18:57,255
Now leave me
here and get moving!

245
00:18:57,255 --> 00:18:58,489
[AL]
Don't give up...!

246
00:18:58,489 --> 00:19:05,122
I swear... I'll save you!

247
00:19:05,122 --> 00:19:06,689
Oh no!

248
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:09,322
Come on, legs...! Move it!

249
00:19:09,322 --> 00:19:10,689
We've come too far!

250
00:19:10,689 --> 00:19:12,522
We can't afford
to be beaten now!

251
00:19:12,522 --> 00:19:15,189
I won't let it happen.

252
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:20,455
Mr. Heinkel... grab on!

253
00:19:20,455 --> 00:19:22,622
We're not giving up!

254
00:19:22,622 --> 00:19:26,955
You brothers... are
really something else.

255
00:19:26,955 --> 00:19:29,655
You're still determined
to help another person...

256
00:19:29,655 --> 00:19:32,989
even when you're falling
to pieces yourself.

257
00:19:35,955 --> 00:19:37,522
[AL]
I promised...

258
00:19:37,522 --> 00:19:40,022
I promised my brother...

259
00:19:40,022 --> 00:19:44,022
I wouldn't let anyone
else die, no matter what.

260
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,122
I guess you're right...

261
00:19:53,122 --> 00:19:54,922
Wasn't it Kimblee who said

262
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:58,455
that the true test of
winning was surviving?

263
00:19:58,455 --> 00:20:00,189
Which reminds me,

264
00:20:00,189 --> 00:20:03,322
I have something
that might be useful.

265
00:20:09,122 --> 00:20:11,922
Mr. Heinkel, why
do you have that?

266
00:20:11,922 --> 00:20:13,522
I happened to pick it up...

267
00:20:13,522 --> 00:20:18,022
I got it when Kimblee
abandoned us in the mine.

268
00:20:18,022 --> 00:20:20,222
[AL]
A Philosopher's Stone...

269
00:20:20,222 --> 00:20:23,389
With this we might actually
have a chance at winning...

270
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,655
But--

271
00:20:24,655 --> 00:20:26,389
[HEINKEL]
Yeah, I know...

272
00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:31,522
These are made using
human lives, aren't they?

273
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,589
Your brother told me...

274
00:20:33,589 --> 00:20:36,122
He said you'd rather not use

275
00:20:36,122 --> 00:20:38,689
one of these to get your
original bodies back...

276
00:20:38,689 --> 00:20:41,589
In that case...

277
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:44,922
don't use it for yourself...

278
00:20:44,922 --> 00:20:47,289
use it to save the
entire world instead.

279
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:48,455
You deserve it,

280
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:51,922
because even though they've
been put into that stone,

281
00:20:51,922 --> 00:20:55,455
you still recognize
them as people.

282
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:59,955
I know... those people...

283
00:20:59,955 --> 00:21:02,189
even though they're
trapped in stone...

284
00:21:02,189 --> 00:21:04,189
they still want
to fight to protect

285
00:21:04,189 --> 00:21:07,055
what matters to them.

286
00:21:07,055 --> 00:21:08,922
Let them fight...

287
00:21:08,922 --> 00:21:11,222
They deserve the chance.

288
00:21:17,422 --> 00:21:19,455
[AL]
All right.

289
00:21:19,455 --> 00:21:23,089
Now, you give them hell for me.

290
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:24,655
Alphonse!

291
00:21:28,155 --> 00:21:30,989
[AL]
We'll fight... together!

292
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:36,322
[KIMBLEE]
This dust cloud is a nuisance...

293
00:21:36,322 --> 00:21:38,555
Shall I blow it away
with a blast wave?

294
00:21:38,555 --> 00:21:39,955
No.

295
00:21:39,955 --> 00:21:41,389
The two of them
are still trapped

296
00:21:41,389 --> 00:21:43,522
somewhere in the
bowels of the cloud...

297
00:21:43,522 --> 00:21:44,655
And without his legs,

298
00:21:44,655 --> 00:21:46,889
how can he possibly escape?

299
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:07,022
Ah, well, what do you know...

300
00:22:07,022 --> 00:22:09,122
He isn't exactly running.

301
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:20,022
Good!

302
00:22:21,989 --> 00:22:23,655
[KIMBLEE]
There you are.

303
00:22:23,655 --> 00:22:27,489
Very well done,
