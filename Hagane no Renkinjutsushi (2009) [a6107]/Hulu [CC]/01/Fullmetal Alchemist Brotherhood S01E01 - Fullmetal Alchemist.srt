1
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:14,029
[Roy] The Freezing Alchemist?
Really. He's here?

2
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:15,762
[Bradley] We have information
that he managed to slip

3
00:00:15,762 --> 00:00:17,762
into Central a few days ago.

4
00:00:17,762 --> 00:00:19,795
That's why I've
summoned you here, Colonel.

5
00:00:19,795 --> 00:00:21,795
I need you and
your men to smoke him out,

6
00:00:21,795 --> 00:00:22,762
and bring him in.

7
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:24,562
Consider it done, sir.

8
00:00:24,562 --> 00:00:27,662
I'm glad you're with us in
Central for a while, Mustang.

9
00:00:27,662 --> 00:00:29,995
It's good to know I have
people here I can count on.

10
00:00:29,995 --> 00:00:30,662
Sir.

11
00:00:30,662 --> 00:00:31,495
[Bradley] Ah, one last thing.

12
00:00:31,495 --> 00:00:33,929
Our rising young star
is here as well.

13
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:35,729
I'm placing him at
your disposal.

14
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:37,562
Forgive me, Fuhrer
Bradley, but...

15
00:00:37,562 --> 00:00:39,562
just to be clear, are
you referring to--?

16
00:00:39,562 --> 00:00:43,729
I am... The Fullmetal Alchemist.
Edward Elric.

17
00:00:44,662 --> 00:00:45,829
Ah, dammit...

18
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:48,395
The colonel's never gonna let
us get outta here, is he?

19
00:00:48,562 --> 00:00:49,462
[Alfonse] We already
bought our tickets for

20
00:00:49,462 --> 00:00:52,629
Liore, too. Does this
mean we're not going?

21
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:54,462
I don't know, Al...

22
00:00:54,462 --> 00:00:57,362
For now, let's just get
this over with... OK?

23
00:00:57,362 --> 00:00:58,995
[AL]
Lead the way, brother.

24
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:37,614
[Military Police 1]
There he goes! That way!

25
00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:39,514
You, halt! Halt
or I'll shoot!

26
00:02:40,547 --> 00:02:41,814
[electric shocks]

27
00:02:41,814 --> 00:02:43,047
[screams]

28
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,047
[running footsteps]

29
00:02:46,047 --> 00:02:46,814
[gun shot]

30
00:02:46,814 --> 00:02:47,981
[grunt]

31
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:50,714
[Military Police 2] Ahh!

32
00:02:51,014 --> 00:02:51,914
[electric shock]

33
00:02:51,914 --> 00:02:53,081
[muffled grunt]

34
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:56,881
Water freezes. Water boils...

35
00:02:56,881 --> 00:03:00,014
Either way, you're
just as dead.

36
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:03,081
[whoosh]
[kerchank]

37
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:05,247
That's alchemy... [gasp]

38
00:03:05,247 --> 00:03:07,647
[Edward] What a nasty
thing to do.

39
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:08,947
You of all people should know:

40
00:03:08,947 --> 00:03:10,947
Great deeds require
great sacrifice!

41
00:03:10,947 --> 00:03:13,581
Isn't that the law of
equivalent exchange?!

42
00:03:13,581 --> 00:03:14,547
Save your breath.

43
00:03:14,547 --> 00:03:16,814
The laws of alchemy
don't justify murder!

44
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,414
[magical electric shocks]

45
00:03:20,214 --> 00:03:21,814
[epic morphing sounds]

46
00:03:24,847 --> 00:03:26,814
No transmutation circle...?!

47
00:03:26,814 --> 00:03:28,647
Don't be too impressed...

48
00:03:28,647 --> 00:03:29,447
Now!

49
00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:30,447
[surprised grunt]

50
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:31,647
[Al] Huh!

51
00:03:32,481 --> 00:03:33,481
[metal impact]

52
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:34,647
[groan]

53
00:03:36,014 --> 00:03:37,014
[Isaac] Ugh!

54
00:03:37,014 --> 00:03:38,447
[Ed] Yah!

55
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:39,447
Ugh!

56
00:03:39,447 --> 00:03:40,396
What?!

57
00:03:40,396 --> 00:03:40,814
[whamp]

58
00:03:40,814 --> 00:03:41,547
[Al] Ahh!

59
00:03:41,547 --> 00:03:42,747
No! I had you!

60
00:03:42,747 --> 00:03:43,714
Any water in there
should've boiled!

61
00:03:43,714 --> 00:03:47,414
If it's any consolation,
you did ruin my coat.

62
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:50,981
An Automail arm...

63
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,147
[cloak swoosh]

64
00:03:53,914 --> 00:03:56,047
A young, gifted alchemist...

65
00:03:56,047 --> 00:03:59,147
One who doesn't use
transmutation circles...

66
00:03:59,147 --> 00:04:01,581
and who has an
automail right arm...!

67
00:04:01,981 --> 00:04:03,681
I know you...

68
00:04:03,681 --> 00:04:07,747
You are the Fullmetal
Alchemist! Edward Elric!

69
00:04:11,514 --> 00:04:12,747
[Isaac] So..it's not you?

70
00:04:12,747 --> 00:04:16,614
Oh, um. No. I'm his
younger brother, Alphonse.

71
00:04:16,614 --> 00:04:18,081
But he's a runt...!

72
00:04:18,081 --> 00:04:21,014
Oh yeah?!
Can a runt do this?!

73
00:04:21,014 --> 00:04:22,747
[electric shocks]
zszzerk

74
00:04:22,747 --> 00:04:23,914
Ooh!

75
00:04:25,081 --> 00:04:27,881
I'd heard the stories, but
still, I never imagined this...

76
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:30,714
The Fullmetal Alchemist
is just a little kid...!

77
00:04:30,714 --> 00:04:32,481
Don't call me little!

78
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,547
Ooh!

79
00:04:33,547 --> 00:04:35,747
[Al] You know, Brother,
I don't think he was really

80
00:04:35,747 --> 00:04:38,181
talking about your
height just now.

81
00:04:38,181 --> 00:04:41,414
Well, even if he wasn't
he still pissed me off!

82
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:42,614
So you're the one
we've been hearing

83
00:04:42,614 --> 00:04:45,514
all the stories about lately...
The Fullmetal Alchemist!

84
00:04:45,514 --> 00:04:47,947
You're as good as they
say. Thanks for the help.

85
00:04:48,047 --> 00:04:49,581
[Al] Um, You're
welcome, but...

86
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,447
I'm really not the one you
should be thanking...

87
00:04:52,447 --> 00:04:53,614
There!

88
00:04:54,814 --> 00:04:56,814
C'mon, let's get goin' Al...
We've got a train to catch.

89
00:04:56,814 --> 00:05:00,147
[Al] Oh, okay, if you think
it's alright to leave...

90
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:02,581
[footsteps]

91
00:05:02,581 --> 00:05:03,647
Ha!

92
00:05:05,747 --> 00:05:06,714
Huh?

93
00:05:06,714 --> 00:05:08,047
[laughter]

94
00:05:08,047 --> 00:05:09,847
[typhoon-force water]

95
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:12,481
[cough]
What is that? Steam?

96
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:13,747
[Al]
Brother! He's gone!

97
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:14,714
Huh!

98
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,914
[Ed] Dammit, now he
really pissed me off!

99
00:05:18,614 --> 00:05:19,947
[Roy] Looks like
you underestimated

100
00:05:19,947 --> 00:05:22,081
your opponent, Fullmetal.

101
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:24,147
Who is this guy, anyway?

102
00:05:24,147 --> 00:05:25,814
[Roy] You'd know that if you
listened to the briefing

103
00:05:25,814 --> 00:05:27,047
like I told you to...

104
00:05:27,047 --> 00:05:29,814
But no, you had to go
charging right after him--

105
00:05:29,814 --> 00:05:31,414
Yeah, yeah!
I get it, all right?

106
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,481
I'm sorry, 'kay?
Whatever.

107
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:35,947
Next time a superior tells
you to pay attention,

108
00:05:35,947 --> 00:05:37,581
you might just try it.

109
00:05:37,581 --> 00:05:39,047
[ED]
Fine.

110
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,814
Now then... His
name is Isaac McDougal.

111
00:05:41,814 --> 00:05:45,547
Or, as he was known back in
the day, "Isaac the Freezer."

112
00:05:45,547 --> 00:05:47,714
He's a former
State Alchemist.

113
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:48,947
[ED]
Former?

114
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:50,081
[Roy]
That's right...

115
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:52,414
He served in the
Ishvalan War...

116
00:05:52,414 --> 00:05:54,847
During that time,
he gave us no signs

117
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:56,547
that he'd turned traitor...

118
00:05:57,481 --> 00:06:00,147
But after.. he immediately
resigned his commission

119
00:06:00,147 --> 00:06:02,414
and went into hiding...
He's been working with

120
00:06:02,414 --> 00:06:04,914
the antiestablishment
movement ever since.

121
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:08,181
Taking him into custody
is a matter of top priority.

122
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:11,181
[Roy] Whether it's dead or
alive--that's up to him.

123
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:13,681
No way. I'm not
killing anyone for you.

124
00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:15,081
[Roy]
And that's your choice...

125
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:17,781
Your orders are simply
to help us contain him.

126
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:18,814
That's all.

127
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,614
Hmph... Off topic...

128
00:06:23,614 --> 00:06:24,814
Have you turned up any leads

129
00:06:24,814 --> 00:06:27,014
for getting your bodies
back to normal?

130
00:06:28,081 --> 00:06:30,647
Maybe if you ever
gave us time to look!

131
00:06:30,647 --> 00:06:32,514
Roy! How goes?
Heard you let 'em

132
00:06:32,514 --> 00:06:34,514
put you in charge of
catching the Freezer, huh?

133
00:06:34,514 --> 00:06:36,181
One hell of a nasty assignment...

134
00:06:36,181 --> 00:06:39,781
But hey, could be your chance to
earn that promotion to Central?

135
00:06:39,781 --> 00:06:42,047
Oh, say!.. Looks like my
timing was perfect!

136
00:06:42,047 --> 00:06:43,914
You two are the Elric
brothers, right?

137
00:06:43,914 --> 00:06:44,747
[Ed and Al] Uh-

138
00:06:44,747 --> 00:06:46,447
Wow, it's an honor
to finally meet

139
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,747
the youngest State
Alchemist ever.

140
00:06:47,747 --> 00:06:49,147
You're a real legend
around here...

141
00:06:49,147 --> 00:06:51,581
I'm Lieutenant Colonel
Maes Hughes. A pleasure.

142
00:06:51,581 --> 00:06:52,914
Um, you want Edward.

143
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:55,181
I'm actually his younger
brother, Alphonse.

144
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,481
What?!.. You're the
Fullmetal Alchemist?

145
00:06:57,481 --> 00:06:59,081
Sorry, I had no
idea you'd be so--

146
00:06:59,081 --> 00:07:01,181
[thinking] Go on,
say "little." I dare you--

147
00:07:01,181 --> 00:07:02,147
[Roy] Hughes.

148
00:07:02,147 --> 00:07:03,081
Yeah?

149
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:04,147
What are you doing here?

150
00:07:04,147 --> 00:07:05,414
Go home.

151
00:07:05,414 --> 00:07:06,147
Actually...

152
00:07:06,147 --> 00:07:08,414
I'm here on official business.

153
00:07:08,414 --> 00:07:10,047
You. Elrics...
I understand that

154
00:07:10,047 --> 00:07:11,781
you two don't have
a place to stay,

155
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:13,581
which means you'll
have to come with me.

156
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:14,747
[Al] Huh?

157
00:07:16,181 --> 00:07:17,514
Ahh!

158
00:07:20,747 --> 00:07:22,847
My wife Gracia and
my daughter Elicia.

159
00:07:22,847 --> 00:07:24,781
We'd love to have you!

160
00:07:25,647 --> 00:07:27,147
Hi, princess...!

161
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:27,981
[laughter]

162
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:31,614
Ow!... Daddy,
your beard is itchy!

163
00:07:32,114 --> 00:07:34,714
Like this? Itchy! Itchy!

164
00:07:34,714 --> 00:07:37,447
[wholesome laughter continues]

165
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:40,747
[Hughes] Look! We have guests!
These are the Elric brothers.

166
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:43,114
Big brother!

167
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:44,114
Little brother!

168
00:07:44,114 --> 00:07:45,047
Urg!

169
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:48,681
Nice to meet you.
My name is Edward Elric...

170
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:51,547
This is my younger brother,
Alphonse Elric...

171
00:07:51,547 --> 00:07:54,681
Get that?...
Youn..ger..bro..ther!

172
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:56,581
[Elicia]
But younger means little.

173
00:07:56,581 --> 00:07:57,581
You're little!

174
00:07:57,581 --> 00:07:58,814
[steam]
Where do you get
off ...!

175
00:07:58,814 --> 00:07:59,881
[Al] Just let it go, Ed.

176
00:07:59,881 --> 00:08:02,147
These people are being
nice to let us stay here.

177
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:03,814
[Hughes] Hope you
boys are hungry.

178
00:08:03,814 --> 00:08:05,847
Gracia's cooking is delicious.

[Elicia giggling]

181
00:08:10,414 --> 00:08:12,081
[Hughes] Ok, eat up.

182
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:14,947
Thanks...!

183
00:08:14,947 --> 00:08:16,614

Wow, you weren't kidding!

184
00:08:16,614 --> 00:08:17,814
This's great!

185
00:08:17,814 --> 00:08:19,781
[Gracia] Don't be shy,
eat all you want!

186

[Ed]
O-K!

187
00:08:21,947 --> 00:08:23,947
Alphonse, how're you gonna
eat wearing that armor?

188
00:08:23,947 --> 00:08:25,981
Take it off, relax!

189
00:08:26,581 --> 00:08:28,681
[Al] W-well,
you see, uh...

190
00:08:28,681 --> 00:08:30,581
He's not allowed to!
He has to wear it

191
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:31,847
all the time!...
It's, uh--

192
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:33,681
It's part of
his alchemy training!

193
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:34,581
You know how it is...

194
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:35,681
But I'll eat enough for
both of us...!

00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,447

[Kimblee] Hands down,
that's got to be the funniest

199
00:08:44,547 --> 00:08:46,981
joke I've heard in
a long, long time.

200
00:08:46,981 --> 00:08:48,981
The Freezing Alchemist
wants me to

201
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:52,047
come play his sidekick.
Well, as fun as that sounds--

202
00:08:52,047 --> 00:08:53,947
The Crimson Alchemist
works alone.

203
00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:55,047
I always have.

204
00:08:55,047 --> 00:08:57,481
[Isaac] Kimblee.
If we work together,

205
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:58,781
we can bring down Bradley

206
00:08:58,781 --> 00:09:01,114
and his god-forsaken military!

207
00:09:01,114 --> 00:09:03,781
You saw the horrors that
took place in Ishval...

208
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:05,514
You were there, dammit!

209
00:09:05,514 --> 00:09:07,647
You know the things
Bradley ordered us to do,

210
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,181
the kind of man
he really is!...

211
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,814
That's why you killed all
those officers, isn't it?

212
00:09:11,814 --> 00:09:12,981
To send him a message?

213
00:09:12,981 --> 00:09:15,047
[Kimblee laughs]

214
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:17,514
I think you've got
me all wrong.

215
00:09:17,514 --> 00:09:19,014
My motives
aren't so sophisticated

216
00:09:19,014 --> 00:09:21,047
as "revenge" or "honor"
or any of that...

217
00:09:21,047 --> 00:09:23,547
The reason I killed
all of those men...

218
00:09:23,547 --> 00:09:25,014
...was because I could.

219
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:27,047
It's that simple.

220
00:09:27,047 --> 00:09:28,914
[Isaac] That's too
bad, Kimblee...

221
00:09:28,914 --> 00:09:32,147
That truly is too bad.

[Gracia] Maes, dear.
What's wrong?

228
00:09:49,514 --> 00:09:50,747
Can't sleep?

229
00:09:50,747 --> 00:09:52,447
Guess not.

230
00:09:56,814 --> 00:09:58,514
I know what's in
that head of yours.

231
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,481
Hm?

232
00:09:59,481 --> 00:10:01,681

State Alchemists, right?...

"the Dogs of the Military"

236
00:10:06,614 --> 00:10:08,647
not exactly the most
popular bunch...

237
00:10:08,647 --> 00:10:10,781
When I try to imagine
what that must be like,

[Ed] Yeah. Almost
as good, too.

245
00:10:25,714 --> 00:10:28,481
Really?!.. In that case,
I'm definitely adding it

246
00:10:28,481 --> 00:10:31,581
to the list of things I'm gonna
eat once I get my body back.

247
00:10:31,581 --> 00:10:34,847
Right! Put it on there!
Right near the top!

get our old bodies back soon...

inch of the city.

him, shoot on sight...

He's mine.
