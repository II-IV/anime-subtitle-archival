1
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,112
A few days since coming to Tokyo,

2
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,908
this is what I see when I wake up.

3
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:35,369
I mean...

4
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,172
How many times do I have to tell you?

5
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:48,757
Good morning.

6
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,176
That has my name on it.

7
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,302
So stingy.

8
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,720
Come on.

9
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,348
Let me have half for my hangover.

10
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:57,307
No.

11
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:01,353
Yesterday, I asked you repeatedly
if you wanted one.

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,313
Well, I was drunk.

13
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:08,443
So, did you hear back at all?

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,528
Not yet.

15
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:13,782
I guess moving back
to a place you left isn't that simple.

16
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:14,658
And from your job?

17
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,200
Also nothing.

18
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,870
You know, I have to go out today.

19
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,916
This unfinished beat covers the night

20
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,794
Embracing us before we're crushed

21
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:30,590
Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand

22
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,427
There will be change
If you just reach out

23
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:43,103
Crying in a crowd with a voiceless voice

24
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,232
Come morning
The footsteps drown out the voice

25
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,403
No matter how much time passes
It never dries

26
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,158
The cold, muddy waters of a decaying city

27
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,659
In a world where nothing changes

28
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,495
We have to live through it

29
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,790
It may be dumb, but we have no choice

30
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,793
We've already started walking

31
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,713
It may seem unreal
It may seem stupid

32
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,507
This hopeless city of ours

33
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,718
But I still saw it with my own eyes

34
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:17,679
I touched it with these hands
See? See?

35
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,974
See? There it goes again
It's so stupid

36
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,810
Shine a light through
The hopeless darkness

37
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,979
This isn't a dream
Even in a dead city

38
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:28,982
Giving up won't change anything
Even now, now

39
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,569
Now, this unfinished beat covers the night

40
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:35,364
Embracing us before we're crushed

41
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,118
Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand

42
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,788
There will be change
If you just reach out

43
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,049
It looks more like a hospital
than a school.

44
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:55,717
It's a cram school after all.

45
00:02:55,883 --> 00:02:57,177
Will you go every day?

46
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,261
No way.

47
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,138
I can't afford that.

48
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:05,477
I have to study while I'm here
and get into a good college.

49
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,270
So you want to go to college.

50
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,232
I mean, not particularly.

51
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:13,610
It's just that life would be hard
as a high school dropout.

52
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,904
Yeah, that's true.

53
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,365
And there are people
who'd make fun of you.

54
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,910
It's fine, I'm not looking
to get in your business.

55
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,329
As long as you can practice when you can.

56
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:25,247
What?

57
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:28,750
You're free on weeknights
and weekends, right?

58
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,419
We'll need to consider
part-time work, too.

59
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,213
Hold on.

60
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,176
A band?

61
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,387
- You said you'd do it.
- No, I didn't.

62
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,596
You did.

63
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,391
You asked me to
raise my middle fingers with you.

64
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,686
Please stop flipping people off
so casually.

65
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:48,895
Ow...

66
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,523
I didn't mean that I would sing.

67
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,525
I meant it as individuals.

68
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:57,154
Me with school, you with music.

69
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,281
Oh, that's what you meant?

70
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:01,908
I did think something wasn't adding up.

71
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,828
Me too. I was surprised.

72
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,040
It's still so crowded at this time of day.

73
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,293
Oh, you sound like a country bumpkin.

74
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,544
Zip it.

75
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:16,380
But let's say
you work hard on your studies.

76
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,092
How about just dabbling in music?

77
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,303
That's not possible.

78
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,930
I'm not asking you to play an instrument.

79
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,559
I think you'd be good on vocals.

80
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,436
What? Vocals?

81
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,898
You have a good voice and a good soul.

82
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,315
Me?

83
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,317
Yeah.

84
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:41,531
To me, a band is a group of people
who have a lot of stuff they want to say.

85
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,076
Like, "I want to find love!"

86
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,829
Or "The world pisses me off!"

87
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,082
Or "That was so moving!"

88
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,669
Or "I love myself" or "I hate myself."

89
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,964
I thought you were going to sing alone.

90
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:03,970
I thought so too, but there's
something nice about being in a band.

91
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:08,308
You get tense when you're together,
talking behind each other's backs,

92
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:12,896
but you keep it all inside,
and it just builds and builds.

93
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:16,149
Until you can't stand them anymore
and finally explode.

94
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:17,859
None of that sounds good.

95
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,028
What? Oh, right.

96
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,488
But it's fun.

97
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:27,035
Creating something with others
that you couldn't on your own.

98
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,162
What?

99
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,705
It's nothing.

100
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,502
I think this station is closer
to your place.

101
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,422
It doesn't feel like the city at all.

102
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,341
That's the draw of this area.

103
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,968
Your place is that way,

104
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,303
but there's a supermarket over here.

105
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,596
What? Oh, okay.

106
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,597
Ouch.

107
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,392
Are you sure?

108
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,519
Yeah.

109
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,397
Consider it payment for room and board.

110
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,482
- But...
- It's fine.

111
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,026
Can you put the rest away?

112
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,779
Just so you know, I'm not that good.

113
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,073
But you still cook.

114
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,741
I don't hate it.

115
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,369
Let's see... Where's the knife?

116
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,665
It's kind of like writing a song.

117
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,501
You boil the water
while you cut the ingredients,

118
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,754
then make a sauce while it's stewing.

119
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,755
Like you do things simultaneously,

120
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:25,343
then finally bring it all together
as one thing in the end.

121
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,386
I see.

122
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,928
What a crappy knife.

123
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,682
Sorry, I don't have a proper knife.

124
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,934
It's nothing to be sorry for.

125
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,938
But it makes me realize how useless I am.

126
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,940
How am I gonna live on my own?

127
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,568
Did I say something weird?

128
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,529
No, you reminded me of myself.

129
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:48,199
You just have to
tackle these things head-on.

130
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,202
A cycle of trial and error.

131
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,372
And you'll learn from your mistakes.

132
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,208
Like not having any dishes.

133
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:58,793
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,463
All done.

135
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,050
You'll need to buy a light, too.

136
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,469
Is this what we're eating with?

137
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:11,431
You actually are
a girl of privilege, aren't you?

138
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,600
You think like a rich person.

139
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,019
No, I'm not.

140
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,979
We're very middle-class.

141
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,483
Just a little different.

142
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,860
We had family precepts.

143
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:24,945
Family precepts?

144
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,864
Like laws you follow at home?

145
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,324
Yes.

146
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:35,246
One, always eat dinner at home
as a family.

147
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:39,626
Two, no using your phone
in the living room.

148
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:44,756
Three, there will be a family meeting
every Sunday night.

149
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,466
Like that.

150
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,426
That's annoying.

151
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:53,306
My parents are proud of the fact that
they can enforce these precepts.

152
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,433
And word got around at school.

153
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,144
Yeah, I can see that happening.

154
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:03,233
But I ended up dropping out of school
after I stopped going.

155
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,401
Why?

156
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,153
What does it matter?

157
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:11,658
That?

158
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,535
How did you know?

159
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,578
It's all over your face.

160
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,291
The most popular
and prettiest girl in school.

161
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,378
She dated one hot guy after another.

162
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:26,423
So what, did she bully you?

163
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,424
I guess.

164
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,050
Why?

165
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,010
I don't know.

166
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,471
She just didn't like me.

167
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,432
You didn't get her back?

168
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:41,187
Girls like her make sure to have people
on their side before coming after you.

169
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,482
She used her friends
to ignore and harass me.

170
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,318
I even got taken to the hospital,

171
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,864
but even my family said
I shouldn't make a big deal of it.

172
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,198
Stop.

173
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,951
The hot pot will overcook.

174
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,703
It's okay, I like my vegetables soft.

175
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,750
I really think you should sing.

176
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,003
You could write five songs
from that experience alone.

177
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,758
I've always wanted to try being in a band
where I wasn't the vocalist.

178
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,011
I want to know what it's like
to focus on the guitar.

179
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,763
Are you being serious?

180
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:15,929
Yeah.

181
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,020
Dropping out of high school

182
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,523
will limit your future prospects so much.

183
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,527
It'll be too late if you figure out
what you want to be later.

184
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,030
Then...

185
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,657
Then I just need to
get into college, right?

186
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,327
I'll study and get into college then!

187
00:09:38,535 --> 00:09:44,083
No, if I remain a high school dropout
who can't go to college, I'm done for.

188
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:45,710
"Done for," huh?

189
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,838
No, I didn't mean it like that.

190
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:53,134
It's just that I'd feel like I lost
if I don't accomplish this.

191
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:57,138
Like I lost to my bullies,
my parents, and my teachers.

192
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,265
Okay.

193
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,142
I won't ask again.

194
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,394
I'm sorry.

195
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,688
You don't need to apologize.

196
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,525
There's more beer, right?

197
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,657
So heavy!

198
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,784
Those are books.

199
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,495
I'll carry the heavy ones.
You get the others.

200
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:21,913
I'm okay.

201
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,082
Can you do this in one trip?

202
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,793
Yeah, this is the last of the big stuff.

203
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,795
Can you check your room?

204
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:29,754
Okay!

205
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,967
I think that's it.

206
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,929
I need to study.

207
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,350
Here.

208
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,309
You'll be needing this, right?

209
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,563
Oh, you're right.

210
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:50,316
Either way, I can't play it.

211
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,822
I suppose it's better that I take it back.

212
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,033
Thanks.

213
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:01,953
Bye then.

214
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,581
Oh, you don't need me to come with you?

215
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:05,832
I'll be fine.

216
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,208
Okay.

217
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:12,714
Then, can I ask you one last favor?

218
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:13,798
What is it?

219
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,598
I didn't know this was here.

220
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,309
You've heard of the Tama River, right?

221
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,519
It's pretty spacious.

222
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,647
I didn't think Tokyo had places like this.

223
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,732
Tokyo's on the other side.

224
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,859
You were close.

225
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,111
It really is on the edge.

226
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,615
Do you have a request?

227
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,033
Anything you want.

228
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,620
I just want to
hear you sing one last time.

229
00:11:43,785 --> 00:11:45,747
Sing whatever you want.

230
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,250
And also good luck with your studies.

231
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,545
I'm just moving back to
my old place that you've been to.

232
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,631
So let's grab a bite whenever you're free.

233
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,383
Okay.

234
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,386
And good luck with your music.

235
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:07,268
I'll write another song
you'll really love.

236
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:08,227
Yes.

237
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,772
Please flip them all off.

238
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,273
You too.

239
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:14,525
Wait.

240
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,905
If you ever want to flip someone off,
please use your pinky.

241
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,282
I'll be doing the same.

242
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,242
Okay.

243
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,293
Well then...

244
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:40,510
How would you move forward?

245
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,764
It's so blank
It's so long

246
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:50,269
The answers tend to be superficial cliches

247
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:54,774
Whether my fingers tremble or not

248
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,735
There's no right answer
There's no losing

249
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:03,157
I've been me all my life
That's all there is

250
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:09,330
No matter how much I fight
There's no tomorrow

251
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,171
Shoot.

252
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:25,388
"Jim said not to give up."

253
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,683
"Even in darkness,
a ray of hope will one day..."

254
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,107
I need to go buy one.

255
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,236
Girls Band Cry.

256
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:54,333
This is key.
The pronoun that fits here is...

257
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,177
Dodgeball was so fun!

258
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,054
Right? I hit two people!

259
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,765
- That's so impressive!
- Right?

260
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,980
I haven't talked to anyone.

261
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,612
I haven't talked to anyone all week.

262
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,198
Have you finished moving?

263
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,742
Yeah, all done. My back hurts.

264
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,786
Make sure to rest.

265
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:30,912
Thanks.

266
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,753
TOMORROW'S WEATHER FORECAST

267
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,714
Okay, time to study.

268
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:44,509
NEW MESSAGE FROM MOMOKA

269
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,344
Did you buy a light?

270
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:49,138
I got one extra if you want it.

271
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,016
Yes, thank you, I do!

272
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,770
CAN I COME PICK IT UP NOW?

273
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:57,647
Good evening!

274
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,023
Good evening.

275
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,530
Um... It should be around here.

276
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,033
Here it is.

277
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,743
Hello!

278
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,788
Hey! You were quick.

279
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,456
Excuse me.

280
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,167
Sorry to come so soon.

281
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:22,130
It's the one right there.
Seems like it'll work, right?

282
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,173
Thank you!

283
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,175
As long as it's bright.

284
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,177
You settled in yet?

285
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,930
That's a good question.

286
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,934
Wanna grab some food together?

287
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,811
My treat since I'm back at work.

288
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,814
Yes, please.

289
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,316
Is this Nina?

290
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,152
Yeah.

291
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,820
Awa here donated the light.

292
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,072
She's my new drummer.

293
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,533
I'm Subaru Awa!

294
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,826
Nice to meet ya!

295
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,328
I... I'm Iseri.

296
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,373
You'll come eat too, right?
But you pay for yourself.

297
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,083
What? You're so stingy!

298
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,127
I can't be paying for everyone!

299
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:02,670
Ready?

300
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:07,216
Actually, I should go home.

301
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,887
No, you should come.
Nina just got to Tokyo.

302
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,681
Subaru's the same age as you.

303
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,603
This is more like a hot pot now.

304
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,688
You put in too many vegetables.

305
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:25,359
Nappa cabbage gets gross
if you boil it for too long.

306
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,360
Here.

307
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,362
For you.

308
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,363
Thanks.

309
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,742
So, what kind of music do you like, Nina?

310
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,995
What's your favorite band or Vocaloid?

311
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:39,665
She likes old singers
because of her grandma.

312
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,085
Cool, I listen to them too sometimes.

313
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,378
Who do you like?

314
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:48,090
I mean, I wouldn't say I like them...

315
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,634
Isn't this Glarech?

316
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,219
It is.

317
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,221
Wait, you listen to Glarech?

318
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,641
I saw them live once,
and again at a music festival.

319
00:16:56,807 --> 00:17:00,144
- You mean last year's festival in Chiba?
- Yeah.

320
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,313
It was pretty bad.

321
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,523
Was it?

322
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,151
No wonder they disappeared.

323
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,071
They haven't put on a show since.

324
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:14,534
I hadn't really noticed,
but you might be right.

325
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,119
The reviews were good though.

326
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,164
Do you go to live shows, Nina?

327
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,290
Not really.

328
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,166
I see.

329
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,044
Should we put the meat in now?

330
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,420
Do you not like meat?

331
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,421
Nina?

332
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,551
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

333
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,474
Not your type?

334
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:40,601
She's fine.

335
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,811
Then talk to her.

336
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,189
She's trying to connect with you.

337
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,275
What does that mean?

338
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,444
Is she forcing herself to talk to me?

339
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,030
That's how everyone is at first.

340
00:17:53,196 --> 00:17:55,700
You don't know anything about each other.

341
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:59,453
It feels patronizing.

342
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:01,163
That's just your imagination.

343
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:05,334
She goes to acting school,
so that's just how she is.

344
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,086
She doesn't mean any harm.

345
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,422
How kind of her.

346
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:15,344
Really showing off how considerate she is
by dealing with a baby like me.

347
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,846
What's with your attitude?

348
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,097
I'm just fine!

349
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:22,476
You'll never be able to talk to anyone
if you keep thinking like that.

350
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,191
Hey!

351
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,777
You're right.

352
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,281
I don't think I'll ever make any friends.

353
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,782
Because of my personality.

354
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,117
Listen.

355
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,536
I'll probably be alone forever.

356
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,496
Thank you for dinner.

357
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:49,962
Thank you for the light.

358
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,589
You're welcome...

359
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,760
Geez, she's an idiot.

360
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,596
She already has what's most important.

361
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,352
What am I doing?

362
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,488
What am I doing?

363
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:21,619
She was thoughtful and tried so hard
to make a connection with me.

364
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,414
I'm so stupid.

365
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,001
I'm so stupid.

366
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,297
I'm so stupid!

367
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:37,134
Stupid! I'm so freaking stupid!

368
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,430
I'm so stupid.

369
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,765
Shut the hell up!

370
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,558
- Shut up!
- The hell did you say?!

371
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,436
What is that?

372
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,816
Shut up!

373
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,193
What... Hey, stop!

374
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,320
Shut up!

375
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,575
Shut your trap!

376
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,233
I can't even put up a light on my own.

377
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,570
I'm stuck in the dark forever.

378
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,115
I'll never escape the darkness.

379
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,452
Just darkness.

380
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,080
Come on, we should form a band.

381
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,417
Momoka.

382
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:54,628
Subaru.

383
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,173
You need a new hiding spot for your key.

384
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,258
And you already broke the light.

385
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,515
I told you, I like your singing voice.

386
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:10,394
Why would you say a lie like that?

387
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,188
I'm not lying.

388
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,982
You're so negative and complicated,

389
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:18,652
but it's because
you can't lie to yourself.

390
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:23,032
Even though you're so fragile,
you hate bending your views.

391
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:29,121
You're just like my songs
that I had forgotten about.

392
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:34,376
The ones I love
and want to keep holding on to.

393
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:45,429
I... I don't need your kindness...

394
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,686
Why are you laughing?!

395
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,439
What a pain!

396
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,484
Ow!

397
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:04,073
Just take all that negative energy
and put them into songs.

398
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:05,950
Your songs.

399
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:06,992
Here.

400
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,593
Never influenced by anybody
Never becoming anybody

401
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,596
I laughed, thinking it a dream

402
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,683
Numbed by the weakness I had forgotten

403
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,686
I can't even say that I'm lonely

404
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:39,400
This fragile heart
Vulnerable to even casual conversation

405
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:45,531
Is incapable of making anyone happy

406
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:52,746
But still, I feel a growing hope

407
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:58,711
Moving past all of the lies

408
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:02,131
I just want to hear
That I'm not wrong

409
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:05,259
I'm a dreamer, I'm young

410
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:08,888
I don't care if I'm still the same today

411
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,473
I just want to sing with you

412
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,852
My emotions stir so often

413
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:18,022
I've been hated

414
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:21,358
But I'm going to keep walking

415
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:27,573
Proud of myself
Who can never become anybody

416
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,743
Even if I'm alone

417
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:34,204
I believe in myself

418
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:41,253
Every time I get hurt, I just need to sing

419
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,845
