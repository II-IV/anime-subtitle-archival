1
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:13,263
Okay, look over here.

2
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,352
<i>Everyone looks so beautiful.</i>

3
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:20,354
<i>They've been retouched.</i>

4
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:22,731
<i>What?! Really?</i>

5
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,567
<i>You're right.</i>

6
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:29,029
Her nose looks straighter.

7
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,782
Don't use me to check!

8
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:35,619
We'll choose a photo
when you sign your contract.

9
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:36,912
Okay!

10
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,040
<i>This unfinished beat covers the night</i>

11
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,918
<i>Embracing us before we're crushed</i>

12
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:47,631
<i>Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand</i>

13
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,467
<i>There will be change
If you just reach out</i>

14
00:00:56,265 --> 00:01:00,227
<i>Crying in a crowd with a voiceless voice</i>

15
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:04,481
<i>Come morning
The footsteps drown out the voice</i>

16
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:08,610
<i>No matter how much time passes
It never dries</i>

17
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:13,197
<i>The cold, muddy waters of a decaying city</i>

18
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:14,700
<i>In a world where nothing changes</i>

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,536
<i>We have to live through it</i>

20
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,831
<i>It may be dumb, but we have no choice</i>

21
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,584
<i>We've already started walking</i>

22
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,753
<i>It may seem unreal
It may seem stupid</i>

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,548
<i>This hopeless city of ours</i>

24
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:31,842
<i>But I still saw it with my own eyes</i>

25
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,720
<i>I touched it with these hands
See? See?</i>

26
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:38,015
<i>See? There it goes again
It's so stupid</i>

27
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,851
<i>Shine a light through
The hopeless darkness</i>

28
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,020
<i>This isn't a dream
Even in a dead city</i>

29
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,063
<i>Giving up won't change anything
Even now, now</i>

30
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,568
<i>Now, this unfinished beat covers the night</i>

31
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:52,404
<i>Embracing us before we're crushed</i>

32
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:57,159
<i>Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand</i>

33
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,828
<i>There will be change
If you just reach out</i>

34
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:10,005
What? Their part-time job?

35
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,215
You could've told me.

36
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:16,136
Today is Rupa and Tomo's
last day at the store.

37
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:20,474
They really wanted to go
since the job has been good to them.

38
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,851
Well, I understand then.

39
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,144
Sorry.

40
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,480
That's the CEO's doing.

41
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,399
Water bottles with our company name on it.

42
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,610
Togenashi Togeari water?

43
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,738
My throat feels scratchy
just hearing that.

44
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,866
Okay, the contracts look in order.

45
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:43,163
Which means as of now,
you are all officially part of our agency.

46
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,749
I, Miura, will be responsible for you.

47
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,376
I'm honored.

48
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,627
Us too.

49
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,212
Thank you.

50
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,132
<i>And so, we were able to join an agency.</i>

51
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,425
What?

52
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,885
200,000 yen?

53
00:02:57,052 --> 00:03:00,389
Yeah, I think she said
on the 25th of each month?

54
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,848
And we can use it?

55
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:03,433
Of course.

56
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,893
It's our salary.

57
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,895
Really?!

58
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:10,190
I bet you didn't read the whole contract.

59
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:14,903
Obviously, the money
comes with certain conditions.

60
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:16,905
One day suddenly,

61
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,742
they demand you star in an adult-y video!

62
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,537
"It's in your contract!"

63
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,665
Keep it down.

64
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,333
But Subaru's...

65
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,918
It won't be like that.

66
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:35,424
The agency just gets a percentage
of our earnings.

67
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,426
Merch, concerts, and albums too.

68
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:42,431
The agency will help promote us,
and if we make it big, it's a win-win.

69
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,434
Well, that's the gist of it.

70
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,811
I hope we can...

71
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,689
What? You're surprisingly not confident.

72
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:54,276
Are you still hung up
on that music festival?

73
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,570
I bet you're egosurfing, aren't you?

74
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:57,904
Of course!

75
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,948
We put on such a great show!

76
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,326
But all they talk about is D-D!

77
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,204
I know our show was way better!

78
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,206
I said keep it down.

79
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,750
Besides, we were on different stages.

80
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:16,630
And it's no surprise considering an idol
band impressed even the rock aficionados.

81
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,467
Of course they're going viral.

82
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,720
But we were great too! Why not us?!

83
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,846
Don't ask me.

84
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:27,434
Well, there still were people
who gave us recognition.

85
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,644
And it led to our contract.

86
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,604
But still...

87
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,607
I told you not to egosurf.

88
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,275
Sorry.

89
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,152
You don't have to rush.

90
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,945
The competition is just starting.

91
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:40,863
Right.

92
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,867
I guess you've been
thinking about it a lot too.

93
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,911
- Ow!
- Ow!

94
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,913
BEEF BOWL

95
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:48,872
Here you go.

96
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,373
CONTRACT ENCLOSED

97
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,876
Your copies of the contract.

98
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,755
Also, congrats on your last day!

99
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,423
What is that?

100
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,509
Just take it!

101
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,011
What would you like to order?

102
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,513
One medium bowl.

103
00:05:04,678 --> 00:05:06,515
But we're having hot pot after this!

104
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,058
One beer and one medium bowl.

105
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,810
What? You're gonna drink?

106
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,521
Don't worry, I'll drink tonight too.

107
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,565
Then I'll have a medium bowl too.

108
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,151
Okay, wait one moment.

109
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,029
We came here a lot.

110
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:25,033
This was the first place
I bought you dinner.

111
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,034
Really?

112
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:29,538
It took her four hours to get here
from Tokyo Station,

113
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,040
and she was crying about
not having her key and whatnot.

114
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,166
How bad with directions are you?

115
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,170
No, it's because the Yokosuka Line
is so complicated.

116
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,547
Tomo.

117
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,299
Thanks for everything.

118
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,178
You too, although,
we're just getting started.

119
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:51,685
Now, it's time to kick off
our party for signing our contract!

120
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:54,563
Huh?

121
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,900
They said they just left work,
so they'll be here soon.

122
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,068
Okay.

123
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:03,321
They had some things
they needed to wrap up.

124
00:06:04,613 --> 00:06:05,824
Ow.

125
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:10,495
I never knew raw pumpkins were so hard.

126
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,331
My, it's been a while, princess.

127
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,001
It's not like that!

128
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,336
I've told you before.

129
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:20,213
What is it?

130
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,092
Actually, you may have been right.

131
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,180
You know how you taught me a lot
when I first moved here?

132
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,726
I was really shocked at the time.

133
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,520
That I couldn't do anything.

134
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:39,232
That I didn't even realize
how much I didn't know.

135
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:41,860
Are you better now though?

136
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,445
Yes!

137
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,488
I'll keep working on the guitar though.

138
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,616
Are you sure this was for the best?

139
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:52,120
We just all need to get to a point
where we can say that it was.

140
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:53,830
Okay, okay.

141
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,374
We're here!

142
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,793
Sorry we're late.

143
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,836
It's freezing!

144
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,630
It's colder in here!

145
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,341
Oh! Beer! Beer! Beer!

146
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,634
Geez...

147
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,347
Also, I made our band logo.

148
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,389
What?

149
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,391
Cheers!

150
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,895
Don't start without us!

151
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,106
We haven't even kicked it off yet!

152
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,400
They can't hear you.

153
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,735
Honestly.

154
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,654
I guess we can start too.

155
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,405
Okay, fine.

156
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:32,118
I told you
I like my Napa cabbage really soft.

157
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,412
- I also like it soft.
- See?

158
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,790
You two are such a pain!

159
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,458
We have our preferences!

160
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,876
- Yes.
- Shut up.

161
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,003
It tastes way better this way.

162
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,546
It's started already.

163
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,298
It needs texture to be good.

164
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,967
I'll convert you to our side.

165
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,177
Try it!

166
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,055
- Come on, eat it.
- That's so hot!

167
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,848
- You can do it.
- What is this, an old skit?

168
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,434
- Let's eat it together.
- It's too hot!

169
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,353
- What is it?
- Don't be picky!

170
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,689
An idea for a song.

171
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,692
I came up with a title.

172
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,945
DAYS LATER

173
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,238
Wow...

174
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,948
So cool!

175
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:12,701
Good morning.

176
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,203
This is your engineer, Mr. Nakata.

177
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,205
I'm Nakata, nice to meet you.

178
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,957
Nice to meet you.

179
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,126
And his assistant, Mr. Nakano.

180
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,961
Nice to meet you!

181
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,130
And Mr. Tanaka, the AP.

182
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,214
I'm Tanaka.

183
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,633
And Mr. Tano with promotions.

184
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,801
I'm Tano!

185
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,219
What?!

186
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,222
I don't think I can memorize all that.

187
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,975
Well, memorizing names
becomes part of the job.

188
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,477
Did you memorize them already?

189
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:43,732
Of course. It's common sense
for a grown-up after all.

190
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,776
Then what's the engineer's name?

191
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:47,777
Mr. Tanaka.

192
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:48,987
<i>It's Nakata.</i>

193
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,280
I'm sorry!

194
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:52,991
Don't laugh.

195
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:56,995
The song is the one you gave us
the other day, right?

196
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,497
Yeah, I put in some temporary lyrics.

197
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,249
Here.

198
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,043
Stop laughing already.

199
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,169
Sorry.

200
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,006
This title...

201
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,175
Yeah.

202
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,260
It's inspired by all of you.

203
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,014
When I thought about
what our first song should be,

204
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,267
I knew it had to be about us.

205
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,269
Momoka...

206
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,521
Okay, let's get started.

207
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,190
Nina.

208
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,652
If you're serious about beating on D-D,
put your heart into this.

209
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:31,404
Yeah.

210
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,408
<i>The five of us began writing our new song.</i>

211
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,678
BUDOKAN, HERE WE COME!

212
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:09,818
OPEN PRICE
79,200 YEN

213
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,077
BUDOKAN

214
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,878
Was it too much?

215
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,089
You think so? I think it's fine.

216
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:35,051
What about moving that part
to the beginning?

217
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,095
I guess that wouldn't be bad.

218
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,098
Yeah. We can try redoing it.

219
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:43,852
I'm sorry, but it's quite late.

220
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,227
Okay.

221
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,731
We made it.

222
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,066
Good night.

223
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,985
I'll text you later.

224
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,196
It's pretty fun.

225
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,239
What is?

226
00:10:56,405 --> 00:11:00,118
Making a new song for ourselves.

227
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:04,372
When I imagine it reaching
someone else soon...

228
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,791
It's not that easy.

229
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,879
Sometimes it never reaches anyone,
no matter how much you want it to.

230
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,422
Don't worry.

231
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:16,301
Look how hard we're working on it.

232
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,344
It'll be fine.

233
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,767
This part still bothers me.

234
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,604
<i>Do you want to listen from this side?</i>

235
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,522
Okay.

236
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,150
Huh? Where's Ms. Miura?

237
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,569
She stepped out for a call.

238
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:39,032
Can you go get her?
She should probably listen to it, too.

239
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,033
Okay.

240
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,495
- Ms. Miura...
- D-D?!

241
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,538
Really?

242
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,583
I see. I'll call back later.

243
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:55,548
Momoka wanted you
to listen to our song too.

244
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:58,635
Did you overhear that?

245
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,094
No.

246
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:01,511
I see.

247
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,974
What about Diamond Dust?

248
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:10,313
They sent this over earlier.

249
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,106
Club Citta for two days.

250
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,317
First day, Diamond Dust.

251
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,319
Second day, Togenashi Togeari.

252
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,403
For real?

253
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,988
On a big stage?

254
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:24,202
It'll be in February.
It's like they know our song's schedule.

255
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,205
They want it to coincide with Valentine's.

256
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,665
Sounds good to me!

257
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,083
Bring it on!

258
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,627
Please read the next page.

259
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:37,506
You will compete over
ticket sales and attendees,

260
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,843
and the winner's song will be chosen
for a TV show's theme song.

261
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,220
I see.

262
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,804
That's how it is.

263
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,598
What is?

264
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,350
We can't win?

265
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,102
Why give up before we even try?

266
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,854
- We won't...
- It's obvious!

267
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:55,482
D-D has doubled their follower count.

268
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:56,985
It's a fixed race.

269
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:02,782
They brought this to us
because they know they'll win.

270
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:07,620
Then they can openly say
they're better than us.

271
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,330
But...

272
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,250
But we'll be on the same stage this time!

273
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:15,878
Then we just need to get everyone pumped
like at the festival!

274
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,380
Think about it.

275
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:18,589
What?

276
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:23,136
The unfair thing about this is that
we're not playing to the same crowd.

277
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,723
We might be facing off,
but we're both playing solo.

278
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:31,519
Which means what's important isn't
the performance, but the crowd draw.

279
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,397
The more famous one will always win.

280
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:35,898
That's unfair.

281
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,401
There's no point in getting mad.

282
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,739
What do the D-D members think about this?

283
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,323
No idea.

284
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,535
They don't think anything of it.

285
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:51,039
At the very least,
the girl I know, Hina, won't care.

286
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:55,043
She sees nothing wrong with
getting an advantage.

287
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,046
I feel like talking about this
will start an argument.

288
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,964
What's wrong with that?

289
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,508
It happens a lot on TV.

290
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,802
Like throwing beer or drinks
at each other.

291
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,179
I've already been through that.

292
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,473
What?! Really?

293
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,432
Then...

294
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,684
All we can do is vote.

295
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,977
Who thinks we should do it?

296
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,773
Who thinks we shouldn't?

297
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:22,403
<i>I see.</i>

298
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:27,450
We discussed it as a group
and we think it's too soon.

299
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,535
We need more time to prepare.

300
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,287
Understood.

301
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:35,041
I'll let them know we decline.

302
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,417
Thank you.

303
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,045
What did you think about this?

304
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,254
Nina.

305
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,342
Honestly, I was torn.

306
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,803
I thought winning would be difficult,

307
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:51,808
but doing this against D-D
would help with your publicity.

308
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,142
Then...

309
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,979
But at the same time,
if the results are too one-sided,

310
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:00,733
it will leave the impression
that you're unpopular.

311
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:05,071
Were they aiming for that as well?

312
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,990
Build each other up
or tear each other down.

313
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,701
Either one could just be for show
or their real goal.

314
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,954
Honestly, I don't know.

315
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,083
Phew, I'm tired.

316
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,502
Everything seems like a scheme.

317
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,963
It's like we're in the adult world now.

318
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,048
What?

319
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,592
You still think we should do it?

320
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:31,222
I'm wondering if this is what
being a pro is going to be like.

321
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,516
You're the one who chose this path.

322
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,518
We're back.

323
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,228
It's not feeling right.

324
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:40,439
We can go back to the old phrase.

325
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,484
That wasn't working either.

326
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:47,363
It might be faster to just
rewrite it from scratch.

327
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,031
I guess we could.

328
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,616
What? Really?

329
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,368
The same part from before?

330
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:53,327
Yeah.

331
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:57,123
It seems a little dated,
and people might not like it.

332
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,082
Yeah?

333
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:01,461
I guess key changes are trendy now.

334
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,173
Like that?

335
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,132
Yeah.

336
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:07,717
Momoka.

337
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,135
What?

338
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,846
It seems like you're thinking too hard

339
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:15,641
and you're drifting further
from where we started.

340
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,937
This is supposed to be
our song by you, right?

341
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,398
Then why not just let it be that?

342
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:27,445
All that's important is
whether or not it is our song.

343
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,198
I think that's all that matters.

344
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,160
I will see you again tomorrow.

345
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,495
Thank you.

346
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,081
Excuse me.

347
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:40,666
Yes?

348
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,546
I still want to take on D-D.

349
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:50,301
I understand there are
other things at play here.

350
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,805
But we'll get to headline
our own show, right?

351
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,140
And we can sing our songs?

352
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,309
Yeah, we will, but...

353
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:01,187
Then I think we should do it!

354
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:05,942
I don't think we should ever
run away from playing our music.

355
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,484
If we do that...

356
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,862
We lose?

357
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,571
Yeah.

358
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,074
Can't we do it?

359
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,407
Momoka?

360
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,249
You should decide.

361
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:26,379
You're the one with the most history
with Diamond Dust.

362
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,840
Nina, Subaru, and Tomo,
you're okay with that, right?

363
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,010
What do you say?

364
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,347
S-So cold.

365
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:39,016
Really? I'm totally warm.

366
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,269
It's perfect fall weather.

367
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,021
What?! You northerners are crazy.

368
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,607
My legs are bare over here!

369
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:48,317
As expected of a high school girl.

370
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,528
What's that supposed to mean?

371
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:51,737
Honestly!

372
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,615
This is your neighborhood, right, Nina?

373
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,118
Why are we at a shrine?

374
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,913
It's actually the perfect time
for visiting shrines or temples.

375
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,833
So you're here to pray?

376
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,959
I see.

377
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:09,422
Did you ever visit shrines
with Nana or the rest of D-D on New Years?

378
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,631
Nope.

379
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:15,594
We didn't have time for prayers,
and it wasn't my thing.

380
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,054
I see.

381
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:21,183
But we can use all the help we can get,
be it from the gods or anyone.

382
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,643
If they exist, that is.

383
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,647
What is it, Momoka?

384
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:30,401
It's weird how irritated you've been.

385
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:33,362
Oh, that's it?

386
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,364
The song's just not going how I want...

387
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,657
Liar.

388
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,535
I don't want you to lie to us.

389
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,540
I'm scared.

390
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:51,547
The more I start writing seriously,
the more I start reliving that anxiety.

391
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,884
I get scared that
I might lose it all again.

392
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,178
I knew it.

393
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,347
That you were suffering.

394
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,601
We were all alone in this world.

395
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,354
But we had music.

396
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,816
Even now, your passion
still flows through me, Momoka.

397
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,570
And that's brought me all to you.

398
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,199
I trust this feeling

399
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,700
and our music.

400
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,578
So please trust yourself.

401
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:27,166
I want to create the story of
Togenashi Togeari.

402
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:31,462
I want the five of us
to continue to have the same dream.

403
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,967
I believe the god of rock exists.

404
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,515
That'd be nice.

405
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,936
If the god of rock existed,
what would you ask them?

406
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,356
<i>To sell a million CDs, obviously.</i>

407
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,109
<i>How about 10 million then?</i>

408
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,945
<i>More! 100 million!</i>

409
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:01,117
I'm asking to let us beat D-D at our show.

410
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,954
Momoka.

411
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,080
What?

412
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,377
There you go.

413
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,380
Do you have any thoughts?

414
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,757
I think it's good.

415
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,175
Yeah.

416
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,386
This seems clearest.

417
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,637
I like it, too.

418
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:28,686
I try not to express
if I like a song or not.

419
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,146
Right.

420
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:35,025
And I swear this isn't flattery,
but I like how it is now.

421
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,903
It properly has
all the things you want in it.

422
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:43,409
I've watched you all these last few weeks,
and this song is true to yourselves.

423
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,411
Really?

424
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,165
So it felt fulfilling to work on it.

425
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:54,795
I'm glad I took this job
helping a band like yours.

426
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:56,797
Just saying.

427
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:59,049
Thank you.

428
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,553
Thank you, Mr. Tanaka!

429
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,679
It's Nakata.

430
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:09,518
I'll let you know
when the mixing process is done.

431
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,061
When will it be uploaded online?

432
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,439
If everything goes smoothly,

433
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,650
we're on schedule
for the start of next month.

434
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,693
Bye then.

435
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,446
I like it too.

436
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,907
I believe this song will be a hit.

437
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,202
Ms. Miura!

438
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,078
Yes?

439
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:29,955
Thank you!

440
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,291
Thank you.

441
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,628
It's too early to thank me.

442
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,463
We're just starting.

443
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:38,839
Bye then.

444
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,351
It's freezing.

445
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,898
Okay then.

446
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,236
Dear god of rock,

447
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:05,157
I wish for a billion views...
But even 10,000 will be enough.

448
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,117
Please.

449
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,912
Please!

450
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,249
VIEWS: 103

451
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,297
What is this...

452
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,677
<i>Never influenced by anybody
Never becoming anybody</i>

453
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,680
<i>I laughed, thinking it a dream</i>

454
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,766
<i>Numbed by the weakness I had forgotten</i>

455
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:33,769
<i>I can't even say that I'm lonely</i>

456
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:39,441
<i>This fragile heart
Vulnerable to even casual conversation</i>

457
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:45,573
<i>Is incapable of making anyone happy</i>

458
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:52,830
<i>But still, I feel a growing hope</i>

459
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:58,794
<i>Moving past all of the lies</i>

460
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:02,214
<i>I just want to hear
That I'm not wrong</i>

461
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,342
<i>I'm a dreamer, I'm young</i>

462
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,971
<i>I don't care if I'm still the same today</i>

463
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,557
<i>I just want to sing with you</i>

464
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,935
<i>My emotions stir so often</i>

465
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,105
<i>I've been hated</i>

466
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,442
<i>But I'm going to keep walking</i>

467
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:27,615
<i>Proud of myself
Who can never become anybody</i>

468
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,826
<i>Even if I'm alone</i>

469
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:34,288
<i>I believe in myself</i>

470
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:41,295
<i>Every time I get hurt, I just need to sing</i>

471
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,512

"Rock 'n' Roll Will Never Stop"</i>
