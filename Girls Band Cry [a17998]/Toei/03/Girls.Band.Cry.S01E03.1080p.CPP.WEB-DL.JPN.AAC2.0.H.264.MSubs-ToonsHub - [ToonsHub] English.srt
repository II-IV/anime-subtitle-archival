1
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,685
Something a bit more upbeat.

2
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:21,438
This is it.

3
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:25,150
Maybe the tempo should be a little faster.

4
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:28,946
Oh, that's nice.

5
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,616
The drums carve out the rhythm.

6
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:36,870
The melody stirs my emotions
and the words come spilling out.

7
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:46,463
The moment when you find yourself going,
"Oh, that's nice."

8
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:50,008
That excitement sends you through the air.

9
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,098
It's past midnight...

10
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:03,063
Wait, wait, wait! What am I doing?!

11
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,858
I have to study! Study!

12
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:11,863
I guess you can't simply layer them.

13
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:17,661
So maybe this would be better
if it were a little quieter.

14
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,385
Study!

15
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,014
This unfinished beat covers the night

16
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,891
Embracing us before we're crushed

17
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:44,605
Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand

18
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,441
There will be change
If you just reach out

19
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:57,200
Crying in a crowd with a voiceless voice

20
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:01,455
Come morning
The footsteps drown out the voice

21
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:05,584
No matter how much time passes
It never dries

22
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:10,172
The cold, muddy waters of a decaying city

23
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:11,673
In a world where nothing changes

24
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,508
We have to live through it

25
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,804
It may be dumb, but we have no choice

26
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,556
We've already started walking

27
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:23,727
It may seem unreal
It may seem stupid

28
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,520
This hopeless city of ours

29
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,815
But I still saw it with my own eyes

30
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,693
I touched it with these hands
See? See?

31
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,988
See? There it goes again
It's so stupid

32
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,824
Shine a light through
The hopeless darkness

33
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,993
This isn't a dream
Even in a dead city

34
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,038
Giving up won't change anything
Even now, now

35
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:46,541
Now, this unfinished beat covers the night

36
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,377
Embracing us before we're crushed

37
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:54,132
Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand

38
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,802
There will be change
If you just reach out

39
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:09,773
MISALIGNED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

40
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,861
Ah! No!

41
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,029
Shh!

42
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,615
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,994
The pigeon was on the rhythm...

44
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,497
No!

45
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:32,087
I've barely made it past the first page.
It's like I wasted the whole day.

46
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,340
Oh, a guitar.

47
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,885
Did she have an acoustic guitar too?

48
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,889
Excuse me.

49
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,517
Hey, Nina! Welcome!

50
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,394
Did you eat already?

51
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,562
Not yet.

52
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,648
You want meat buns? Meat buns!

53
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,402
That's bad manners!

54
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,988
I knew you were a rich girl.

55
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,906
Sauce on meat buns?

56
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,658
It's real good.

57
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:06,872
Oh, a friend from school works
in Chinatown and brought back extras.

58
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,081
I see...

59
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,168
Is it good?

60
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,420
Yes, it's tasty.

61
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,130
Good, I'm glad.

62
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,803
So, about our first song.

63
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,013
Did you finish it?

64
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,016
I wish it were that easy.

65
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,392
Oh, then why did you call us over?

66
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,812
This is pretty far for me, you know.

67
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,107
I thought we should talk about
what kind of song we want.

68
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:38,195
I'm having a hard time picturing
what fits the three of us the best.

69
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,990
I don't care as long as
I can bang the drums.

70
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:43,825
What about you?

71
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,161
Yes, it's tasty!

72
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:58,589
I taught you how to use this app
only a week ago, right?

73
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,926
And you made this already?

74
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:01,885
Wow!

75
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:07,682
Momoka said I could just write by ear
instead of learning how to read music.

76
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:08,975
So, you know.

77
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,729
But the fact that
this song is so well-made means...

78
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,982
you spent over
eight hours a day on it, right?

79
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,238
Huh? Where are you going?

80
00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:23,990
- I'm going home.
- What?!

81
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:27,786
I have to study! I have to study!

82
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:29,746
I was right on the mark.

83
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:35,794
It's your fault for showing me this app!
You said it wouldn't affect my studies!

84
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,504
This isn't my fault.

85
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,005
I know that.

86
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,299
Then don't say it.

87
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,802
But...

88
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,387
Okay, okay.

89
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:49,766
I'm sorry for showing it to you.
I'll uninstall it, so just sing...

90
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,517
You don't need to do that.

91
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:52,811
Which is it?!

92
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,271
It's my fault!

93
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:59,067
I just need to shift my focus
and leave the band to you, right?!

94
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,735
Who are you talking to?

95
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,946
Myself!

96
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,738
I'll be back next week.

97
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,327
What is with her?
I don't get her at all.

98
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,081
I'm going home too then.

99
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,959
Hey! There's still meat buns left.

100
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,335
You can have them all.

101
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,545
Bye!

102
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,757
Nina!

103
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,094
Let's walk together.

104
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:28,513
Sure.

105
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,726
It's impressive,
being able to make a song just like that.

106
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,770
I couldn't do it.

107
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:40,317
Um, but I only just
followed some tutorials.

108
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,988
But I know I wouldn't be able to come up
with any lyrics.

109
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,449
Oh, really?

110
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:48,491
Yeah.

111
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:57,500
Um, I need to stop by
the convenience store.

112
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,753
What? I'll come with you.

113
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,508
No, but I'll probably
just walk home after.

114
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,885
I see.

115
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,553
Okay. See you.

116
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,694
Subaru, too?

117
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,282
Why can't you just go yourself?

118
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,911
I have a shift scheduled at my job.
You can't go?

119
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,205
I mean, I could, but...

120
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,874
Nina, it can be after school.

121
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,292
Just take it to her.

122
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,835
For the meat buns.

123
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,801
This is that famous place...

124
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,927
Seriously?

125
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,428
A country bumpkin.

126
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:53,807
Which way?

127
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,517
Hmm.

128
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,686
Hmm.

129
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,187
This way?

130
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:00,939
I guess not.

131
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,445
Found it.

132
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,331
Excuse me.

133
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,251
May I help you?

134
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,131
Y-Yes!

135
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,883
Is Ms. Awa here?

136
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,176
Ms. Awa?

137
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,720
Oh, Subaru!

138
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,097
Hey, Subaru!

139
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,100
For that act,
we can just go with the flow.

140
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,977
Oh, Nina!

141
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,438
What happened?

142
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,190
Did you find this place okay?

143
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,235
I would've come to get you
if you called the school.

144
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,279
I'm sorry I took so long.

145
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,572
Here.

146
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,991
Thanks!

147
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,034
You forgot your phone?

148
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:55,994
Yeah.

149
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,828
I'm such a ditz.

150
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,998
Anyway, they're waiting for you there.

151
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,083
- Okay.
- Later.

152
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,877
Have a nice day!

153
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,963
You're free after this, right?
Let's grab some food.

154
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,048
My treat.

155
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:13,136
I have to go home and study.

156
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,429
Okay, how about this weekend then?

157
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:16,723
Like Sunday?

158
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,768
Really, it's okay.

159
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,770
It's not a big deal.

160
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,813
Well, goodbye.

161
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,484
Should I quit?

162
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,530
Should I quit the band?

163
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:37,660
I'm not stupid. I know you're avoiding me.

164
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:39,496
Um, I...

165
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,415
I'm not trying to get in your way.

166
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,125
There are other bands.

167
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:48,129
No, it's not anything like that.

168
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,506
I'm just...

169
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,345
I'm sorry!

170
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,429
Huh?

171
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,307
Are you sure?

172
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:05,355
Yes, I can always study later.
Or whenever.

173
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,315
No, I meant about me.

174
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:11,903
I mean, I only started playing music
in middle school,

175
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,447
so I don't have much authority.

176
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:20,370
But bandmates tend to be close since they
have to come together to make one thing.

177
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:24,457
And when there's a difference in opinions,
you can't just ignore it.

178
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:29,337
If you just try to gloss it over,
there's bound to be a misunderstanding.

179
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,259
So you should speak up
if there's something you don't like.

180
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,719
It's not that I don't like you.

181
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,139
It's all my fault.

182
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,724
Stop doing that.

183
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,144
I'm used to being hated.

184
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,814
No, that's not it!

185
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,275
I kind of tend to keep my distance,

186
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,444
so people often
make an effort to interact with me.

187
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,738
What? You don't like that?

188
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,323
I don't hate it.

189
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,785
But when people approach me
to be their friend, for some reason,

190
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:04,706
I'm like "You think I'm just going to
to be that easy?"

191
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,125
I can't help but think that...

192
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,960
What a pain.

193
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:12,005
So that's why you dropped out of
high school, huh?

194
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,256
No, that was...

195
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,385
Wait, she told you?

196
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:18,886
Yeah.

197
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,640
Must be nice looking down at me.

198
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:24,893
Listen!

199
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,520
You've got the wrong idea about me!

200
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:31,399
For your information,
I may go to acting school,

201
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,277
but it doesn't give you
a high school diploma!

202
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,279
I'm basically like you!

203
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,032
But you're striving to be an actor!

204
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,035
That means you're chasing your dream!

205
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:45,038
You can proudly tell people that!

206
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,290
That's what you're misunderstanding.

207
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,044
Do you know her?

208
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,047
I think I've seen her before.

209
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,800
The Detective Granny Case Files.
They play reruns around noon.

210
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,052
Oh...

211
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,011
She's my grandma.

212
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:01,971
What?

213
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:06,142
She's a real nag.
She told me to follow in her footsteps

214
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,812
and arranged for me
to go to acting school.

215
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,482
So what about being an actor?

216
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,817
I'm not really trying to be one.

217
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,029
But you're still going to acting school?

218
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,740
Yeah. It makes me hate myself.

219
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,910
Seems stupid when I'm not trying
to be one.

220
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,664
But nobody around me seems to see that.

221
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,126
They just assume that I'm trying to be one
because of my family.

222
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,711
Then what about the band?

223
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,172
Just my way of gently pushing back.

224
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:40,218
I didn't just want to be in the drama club
back in junior high.

225
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,721
So I joined the band club
since I liked bands,

226
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,723
and it was pretty fun.

227
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,726
I even secretly joined a band once.

228
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,727
Your grandma doesn't know?

229
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,188
I couldn't tell her.

230
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,691
Oh, did you see Hachiko?

231
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,901
Won't they call us country bumpkins?

232
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,070
Who cares? You are one anyway.

233
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,905
This is in exchange for
me opening up to you.

234
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:06,160
We're friends now!

235
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,372
Girls Band Cry.

236
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,000
A street show?

237
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,128
Yeah, I figured that would be
a good start.

238
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,922
I've already reserved a spot
for the weekend.

239
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:23,177
I thought we were going to record
and upload a video first?

240
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,138
Yeah, we'll do that too.

241
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,808
But I feel like a live show
is the right call,

242
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,559
especially for this trio.

243
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:31,644
A live show?

244
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,272
That picture you sent made me think

245
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:38,943
the two of you are like
oozing with misery and discontent.

246
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,902
How rude!

247
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,820
Yeah!

248
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:46,242
But that's exactly why
I reached out to the both of you.

249
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,578
What do you think, Nina?

250
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,330
It bothers me a little.

251
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,582
But I guess I can see her point.

252
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:56,044
Can we play without a bass, though?

253
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,087
Nina can't play, right?

254
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,799
It's an amateur event. We'll make it work.

255
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,676
And we also have this.

256
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,178
What's that?

257
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,471
A looper.

258
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,515
You put in sound like this.

259
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,523
See?

260
00:14:18,982 --> 00:14:20,401
Wow.

261
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,863
Wait, by a street show,

262
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,365
do you mean in front of a crowd?

263
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:31,370
Obviously.
I mean, you came to see me perform...

264
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,747
- Huh?
- Huh?

265
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,375
Where are you going?

266
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,584
I'm going home.

267
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,003
Cut it out!

268
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,255
Let go! We never talked about this!

269
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,467
Calm down!
You sang in front of the station.

270
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:45,802
It's the same as that.

271
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,054
It's not that easy!

272
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,515
I don't have any experience.

273
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:54,018
Don't worry, when worse comes to worst,
I'll do something.

274
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,896
Then you should sing instead!

275
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,856
You're way better than me anyway!

276
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,525
Then will you play the guitar?

277
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,402
You know I can't!

278
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,280
I told you. I want to hear you sing.

279
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,490
Why?

280
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:11,035
You'll see if you sing. Just trust me.

281
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,083
I'm going home.

282
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,210
So you're quitting the band then?

283
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:20,169
What?!

284
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,630
Yes, thank you for everything!

285
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:26,717
Hey!

286
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:28,719
It'll be okay.

287
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,274
That's so unfair,
holding the band hostage!

288
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,900
Your logic's not adding up.

289
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,653
- But I...
- Stop being scared.

290
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,323
Whether it goes well or not,
whether you succeed or fail,

291
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,617
you're going to regret it either way.

292
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,411
Because that's who you are.

293
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:54,704
That's...

294
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:55,746
The truth.

295
00:15:55,913 --> 00:16:01,043
Then you might as well go all out
and sing what you're feeling right now.

296
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,170
Am I wrong?

297
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,548
Okay. You lose.

298
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:06,966
Shut up, Subaru!

299
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,594
Put that anger into your singing.

300
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,804
That's how you really feel.

301
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,727
They've got a nice set here!

302
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:21,230
Plus, it's the cheapest rate around here.

303
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,484
Let's see.

304
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,329
Seems good.

305
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,081
Nina, did you learn the song I sent you?

306
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,418
I added the part you composed as well.

307
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:43,377
Yes.

308
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,130
- Then let's try running it.
- Huh?

309
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,633
What did you think we were going to do?

310
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,885
It's way too sudden!

311
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,513
I told you not to be scared.

312
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,474
It's practice. It's gonna suck.

313
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,101
We're gonna fail.

314
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,061
Here.

315
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,038
Slowly.

316
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,975
One, two, three, four.

317
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:52,905
How was that?

318
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,619
I have goosebumps.

319
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,747
I got them all over!

320
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,374
- Aww.
- Hm?

321
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,460
You fell right for Momoka's trap.

322
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,380
Once you know this feeling,
you can never quit.

323
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,383
But why?

324
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:17,597
Humans have a gene
that make them move to sounds.

325
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,725
Music and dance are human instincts.

326
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:21,684
Right?

327
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:22,768
Yeah.

328
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:24,520
What is it?

329
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:28,065
Just thinking how good your voice sounds.

330
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,275
Really?

331
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,611
Yeah, I got goosebumps too.

332
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,279
Okay, let's sing.

333
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:34,739
Okay!

334
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,491
One medium bowl and a beer.

335
00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:39,035
A medium bowl, no onions.

336
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,077
A medium bowl.

337
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,832
You're so hoarse!

338
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:48,085
You both told me to sing hard.

339
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:52,423
But who sings to that point though?

340
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,507
Shut up.

341
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,468
"Thank you very much."

342
00:18:57,011 --> 00:19:01,432
It should be back to normal by tomorrow,
but take care of your voice.

343
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,933
Are you a trio?

344
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,853
I saw your guitar case.

345
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,857
Come check us out.

346
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,984
Thank you.

347
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:15,863
So?

348
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:17,406
So what?

349
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,951
I could hand them ours too.

350
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,871
Only after we check them out.

351
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,580
Thank you for the food.

352
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,458
I should get going.

353
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,876
Go where?

354
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:29,877
My job.

355
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:31,587
Later.

356
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,887
She treated us again tonight.

357
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,390
The beef bowls and the karaoke box.

358
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,561
What is she looking at?

359
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,857
They're Momoka's former bandmates.

360
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:53,984
Look.

361
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:01,325
Today is our next band's
first live performance!

362
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:05,579
A three-piece girl band hailing
from Kawasaki!

363
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,583
Their name is...

364
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,505
Shinkawasaki?

365
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,550
We need to have a meeting
about the band name.

366
00:20:17,715 --> 00:20:20,010
I said it's a placeholder.

367
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,012
Sorry I'm late.

368
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,308
Wait...

369
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,311
Are you wearing that on stage?

370
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,147
Is it bad?

371
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,150
I told you to bare your heart.

372
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,444
Get changed.

373
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,077
This is a band message.

374
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,289
I figured it'd be better
if it was an outfit you hated.

375
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,374
Don't overthink it.

376
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:54,295
Just express what you're really feeling.

377
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,506
Don't worry, I've got your back.

378
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,800
You're timid, but stubborn.

379
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,052
Cowardly, but confident.

380
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,306
You're a walking self-contradiction.

381
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,099
These aren't compliments!

382
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,561
Nina! It's almost time!

383
00:21:11,811 --> 00:21:15,065
You've got so much angst
and energy built up inside you.

384
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,400
And that's...

385
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,320
rock and roll without a doubt.

386
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:22,782
Rock and roll?

387
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,462
Nobody knows who you are
and nobody will wait for you.

388
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,715
But that's what makes it interesting.

389
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:01,529
You're rock and roll, Nina.

390
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:08,577
If nothing changes
No matter how long I wait

391
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,913
Then there's nobody I can rely on

392
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,751
It's not as if the pain disappears
When you blame someone else

393
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,504
I pray to say goodbye
To cowering every day

394
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,840
Holding my knees to my chest

395
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:25,386
I don't even believe in God

396
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:30,391
Shut up (Shut up)

397
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:36,021
Leave me alone (Leave me alone)

398
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,607
A stranger sings
Until they lose their voice

399
00:22:38,773 --> 00:22:41,068
Telling me that I'm not alone

400
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:45,321
I'm sure that to some people
Those words are enough

401
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,116
I don't know

402
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,450
I see

403
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,577
Was that right?

404
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:50,911
I forgot

405
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,204
It's all a pain

406
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,414
I want to break it

407
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,374
I don't have the courage

408
00:22:55,541 --> 00:23:01,005
Someone hurry up and teach me
A reason to live

409
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:05,217
There are so many people to take my place

410
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:10,598
You can't just tell me to be myself

411
00:23:10,763 --> 00:23:13,517
Take it back if it can be granted

412
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,811
I can dream all I want
There's still reality

413
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,689
Is anyone there?

414
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,042
This is...

415
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:40,711
amazing.

416
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:43,339
It's rock and roll.

417
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:50,012
