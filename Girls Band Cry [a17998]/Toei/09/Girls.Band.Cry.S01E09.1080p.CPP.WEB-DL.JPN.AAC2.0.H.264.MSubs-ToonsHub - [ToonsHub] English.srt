1
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,640
Are you done yet?

2
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:18,893
I really thought I was going to die.

3
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,564
Suddenly, only hot air was coming out.

4
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:24,942
It broke...

5
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:31,615
I couldn't sleep at all
since it was so hot.

6
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:32,824
Don't sleep now!

7
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:37,579
Yeah, we need to fix the lyrics
and songs by the festival.

8
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:39,706
We're fixing them?

9
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,709
I like them the way they are.

10
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,086
Really?

11
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,005
What don't you like about them?

12
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,550
Well... How do I say this...

13
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,344
Simply put, they just sound ordinary.

14
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:57,474
What do you think, Tomo?

15
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:58,433
What?

16
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:09,069
Look, I can't deal with
your perfectionism. I quit.

17
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,862
Then me, too.

18
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,244
I think they're fine, I guess.

19
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,000
This unfinished beat covers the night

20
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,877
Embracing us before we're crushed

21
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:30,590
Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand

22
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,427
There will be change
If you just reach out

23
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:43,186
Crying in a crowd with a voiceless voice

24
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:47,441
Come morning
The footsteps drown out the voice

25
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:51,570
No matter how much time passes
It never dries

26
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:56,158
The cold, muddy waters of a decaying city

27
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,659
In a world where nothing changes

28
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,495
We have to live through it

29
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,790
It may be dumb, but we have no choice

30
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,543
We've already started walking

31
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,713
It may seem unreal
It may seem stupid

32
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,507
This hopeless city of ours

33
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,800
But I still saw it with my own eyes

34
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,679
I touched it with these hands
See? See?

35
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,974
See? There it goes again
It's so stupid

36
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,810
Shine a light through
The hopeless darkness

37
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,979
This isn't a dream
Even in a dead city

38
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:29,024
Giving up won't change anything
Even now, now

39
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:32,526
Now, this unfinished beat covers the night

40
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,364
Embracing us before we're crushed

41
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,118
Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand

42
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,788
There will be change
If you just reach out

43
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,048
Why didn't you say anything?

44
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:58,387
You mentioned to me that something was
bothering you about Momoka's new songs.

45
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,223
No reason.

46
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,433
I thought they were fine.

47
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,852
I see.

48
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,145
That's fine then.

49
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:13,360
It's not eating at all.

50
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,071
You're gonna die if you don't.

51
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,990
Who could it be?

52
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,242
A neighborhood notice?

53
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,245
Could you get it
since our mailbox is broken?

54
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:24,246
Yes?

55
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,581
- Good evening! It's Nina!
- No thank you.

56
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,542
Wait, I haven't said anything yet!

57
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,501
What?!

58
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,002
It's so cool.

59
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,005
Don't steal our air-conditioned air!

60
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,757
It's not like you'll run out.

61
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,884
Stop yelling!
You're annoying the neighbors!

62
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,720
You're the one yelling!

63
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,138
Stop ringing the bell!

64
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,015
Paradise.

65
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,184
Leave after you cool down.

66
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,603
That's so cruel.

67
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,982
The AC repairman
won't come until next week!

68
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,525
Not my problem.

69
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,653
Does Momoka not have air conditioning?

70
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,698
She does, but she works nights.

71
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,493
I've been wondering.

72
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,788
Isn't it a bit weak?

73
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,378
It's so cool.

74
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:16,130
A big difference from your janky AC.

75
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,299
Don't call it janky!

76
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,218
It's pretty janky if it can't run on high!

77
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,553
Well, it was labeled not to!

78
00:04:23,053 --> 00:04:24,222
So, anyway.

79
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,434
Both of our apartment AC units broke.

80
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:32,397
We would appreciate some time
in your cool air.

81
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:36,109
Please, just one hour!

82
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,195
This is all her fault, by the way.

83
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,238
Okay, fine.

84
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,742
Just one hour!

85
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,202
Oh, that's Tomo's pet.

86
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,121
It doesn't like the heat.

87
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,706
- Wait...
- What?!

88
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,459
Don't just release it!

89
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,462
So powerful.

90
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,047
Stop saying that.

91
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,089
What an amazing apartment.

92
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,759
Good grief.

93
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,095
Oh, it's Momoka.

94
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,474
She works nearby,
so she's going to drop by later.

95
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,767
Really?

96
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:12,187
Then maybe we can all eat together here.

97
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,232
When did that become an option?

98
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,526
You said only an hour.

99
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,485
Look.

100
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,736
Huh?

101
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,863
We missed our last train.

102
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,074
Looks like it.

103
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,495
I bet this was your plan from the start!

104
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,331
Now, now. How about we play cards?

105
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,624
You're well prepared!

106
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:39,422
I realized that we've never done
anything like this before.

107
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,175
Then since there's four of us...

108
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,927
- Count me out.
- What?

109
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,178
I'm borrowing this room.

110
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,182
I also have Ametaro Dentetsu.
Wanna try the 100-year mode?

111
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,226
We'll be up all night.

112
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,478
Did I do something?

113
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,188
You've done plenty.

114
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,024
No, it's not your fault.

115
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,026
Really?

116
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,237
Let me check on her.

117
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,624
Heading to bed first?

118
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,293
No.

119
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,337
You three can play cards
or whatever without me.

120
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,798
Just leave me alone.

121
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,260
Okay.

122
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,346
If you've got a complaint, say it.

123
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,017
A complaint? Why would I have a complaint?

124
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:39,608
LOSER BUYS BEEF BOWLS

125
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,110
I've lost.

126
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,446
What am I looking at?

127
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,615
You're the cause of all of this, Nina.

128
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,782
No!

129
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,951
It's my AC's fault!

130
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,745
Just tough it out.

131
00:06:52,202 --> 00:06:52,996
I did!

132
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,373
I killed time at the convenience store,

133
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,003
hung out on a bench for an hour,

134
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:06,009
but it's so boring being outdoors
when you can't spend money!

135
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,345
- Where's Tomo?
- She went to bed.

136
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,431
Did she say anything about our songs?

137
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,891
Not particularly.

138
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,267
I see.

139
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,895
It looked like she had something to say.

140
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,438
Where are you going?

141
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,773
The fridge.

142
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,733
Can't have these going warm.

143
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,778
What do you think will happen
if my grandma finds them?!

144
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,281
Don't worry, I'll drink them all
by morning...

145
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,033
Snake?

146
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,701
It's Tomo's pet.

147
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,788
Don't worry, it's calm and not venomous.

148
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,539
Snake!

149
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,540
What a waste!

150
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,501
No!

151
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:40,794
What?

152
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:42,796
What?

153
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:44,798
Momoka.

154
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,049
Momoka!

155
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,259
You can't lock yourself in there.

156
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,470
Get rid of it already!

157
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,973
I guess Momoka doesn't like snakes.

158
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,474
So old-fashioned.

159
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:55,809
It's a snake!

160
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,519
How are you all okay?

161
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,938
It's not a big deal.

162
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,398
That's weird!

163
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,484
How can all four of you
be fine with snakes?!

164
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,944
Just spend some time with it.

165
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,446
There's a snake behind you, Momoka.

166
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:11,700
A NORMAL HAIR DRYER

167
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:12,742
Oh!

168
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,202
It opened.

169
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,454
No!

170
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,580
Beer-tiful save!

171
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,957
Hold on!

172
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,960
- Momoka!
- Just get rid of it!

173
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,714
If we get caught doing that,
I'll be the one who gets in trouble!

174
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,719
Besides, we already put it
in the same room as Tomo.

175
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,761
So come out already.

176
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,472
Hey. You'll break...

177
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,558
No way.

178
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:39,227
You're not a child anymore.

179
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:40,937
- It's going to break!
- Nina!

180
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,150
How was that?

181
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,693
Seriously?

182
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,988
All of you!

183
00:08:51,905 --> 00:08:54,659
- How could you?!
- You're nonassertive, aren't you?

184
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,120
Never come back.

185
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,123
So hot.

186
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,167
Whose fault is that?!

187
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,793
You all get along so well.

188
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,253
We don't!

189
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,255
I'm off to work.

190
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,256
Take care.

191
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,259
Get rid of that snake.

192
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,429
Where's the snake, by the way?

193
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,849
Subaru offered to keep it for now.

194
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,684
I wish I were the snake.

195
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,187
Well, we're done here.

196
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,355
Rupa, let's go.

197
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,107
We need to check up on the apartment.

198
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,611
What? You're ditching me?

199
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:34,032
Why do I have to hang out with you
when it's not even for practice?

200
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:38,244
Momoka said it's important
to do things like that.

201
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,874
If you have time,
can you watch me practice?

202
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,753
I'll go grab my guitar from the apartment!

203
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,050
An acoustic guitar?

204
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,051
Yeah.

205
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:58,056
When I asked Mine for advice,
she said to practice if I wanted to play.

206
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,809
And that this is old but a good guitar.

207
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,102
The second string's off.

208
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,062
Really?

209
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,772
That's so impressive.

210
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,234
You've been playing piano
since you were young?

211
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,570
That's unrelated, anybody could tell
when it's this off-key.

212
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,824
But guitars are amazing.

213
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,410
You really do get callouses
as you practice.

214
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,873
Is it okay now?

215
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,333
It's still a little off,

216
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:29,838
but it's probably the best you can do.

217
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,841
Here I go.

218
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,602
How's that?

219
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,897
I thought we'd play it at the next show.

220
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,066
You've really improved.

221
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,109
Go for it.

222
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:54,571
Adding an extra guitar
will elevate our sound.

223
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,072
- No.
- What?

224
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,868
You can't play a show at your skill level.

225
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,164
Tomo.

226
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,124
Tomo!

227
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,458
How was it?

228
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:11,462
How was it, Rupa?

229
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,965
It's not my expertise.

230
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:17,385
Well, I don't play the guitar either.

231
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:20,388
But you know a lot about music, right?

232
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,682
I guess.

233
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,396
It seemed fine...

234
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,189
as a hobby.

235
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,399
Hobby?

236
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,151
So not on stage?

237
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,239
Do you want to play on stage?

238
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:39,198
Yeah.

239
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:43,077
I realized something
when we went to the Diamond Dust show.

240
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,663
I want to become better.

241
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,458
Not just rely on Momoka.

242
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,920
I want to contribute.

243
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,423
Oh, I mean, with all of you too.

244
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,428
So let me know
if there's something I can improve.

245
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:03,932
It was fine.

246
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:07,434
Tell me! Tomo!

247
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,814
With your talent,

248
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,193
you'll never be good enough!

249
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,540
I see.

250
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,294
Girls Band Cry.

251
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,258
I keep telling you to play seriously...

252
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,386
Stop measuring us to your standards.

253
00:12:42,886 --> 00:12:47,725
We're not like you, who's been winning
piano awards since you were little.

254
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,727
I can't do this.

255
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,146
- Um...
- Stay out of this.

256
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,737
Look,

257
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,740
I talked to her yesterday, but...

258
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,376
It's gotten cooler.

259
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,045
Has it?

260
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:19,090
It's good to go without the AC
from time to time.

261
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,885
You can feel the temperature
change gradually on your skin.

262
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,516
THANK YOU FOR TODAY
STILL HOT AT HOME

263
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,523
Nina was happy.

264
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,861
Of course she wasn't.

265
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,116
You got some guts coming back here.

266
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,828
I wanted your advice on something.

267
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:49,787
Huh?

268
00:13:49,953 --> 00:13:52,415
I didn't come to use your AC!

269
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:53,624
Really?

270
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:58,629
I'm here for something serious
about the band.

271
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,426
I'LL REIMBURSE YOU.
(IN 36 INSTALLMENTS PLEASE) NINA

272
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,057
How was that?

273
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,933
What did Tomo tell you?

274
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,354
She said that with my talent,

275
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,190
I'll never be good enough.

276
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,567
Oof, that's harsh.

277
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:22,570
Though I'm sure
that's partly her personality.

278
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,449
Did you lose motivation?

279
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,451
Why would I?

280
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,579
Well, as long as you're not bothered.

281
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,707
So, what did you think, Subaru?

282
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,460
I guess I agree with Tomo.

283
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,961
Yeah?

284
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,465
I thought I practiced enough
to be able to play onstage.

285
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:46,469
It's not something you can do
only after a year or two.

286
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:51,015
Maybe if you were an amateur,
but not if you're aiming to go pro.

287
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:54,268
But you're managing.

288
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,770
I'm not so sure.

289
00:14:55,937 --> 00:15:00,191
I bet Tomo has a lot
she'd like to say about me.

290
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,319
But she's never said anything, right?

291
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:06,906
Because I don't go out of my way
to ask her like you.

292
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,493
Tomo's probably a little timid.

293
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:15,581
She keeps her distance because
she doesn't want to be hated.

294
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,418
She never approaches people herself.

295
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,921
But if we approach her instead...

296
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,047
Grr!

297
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,050
That sounds like me.

298
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,053
Yeah, you were like that too.

299
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:36,853
Thank you.

300
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,647
I got it an aquarium, so take it with you.

301
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:43,067
It hasn't eaten though. Is that okay?

302
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,068
It's fine.

303
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:47,822
Oh! Tomo!

304
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,658
You're still at it?

305
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:51,617
Yeah.

306
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,703
I had Subaru listen too.

307
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,456
Ow.

308
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,418
Seems fine to me.

309
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,338
You should play on stage if you want to.

310
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,592
Why are you lying?

311
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,520
- I see.
- Oh.

312
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,355
Tomo?

313
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,651
Disbanded?

314
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,907
She came to Tokyo,
recruited members online,

315
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,783
and started a band.

316
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:37,205
Is that how you met her?

317
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:42,126
Yes, there was also a drummer
and a guitarist.

318
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,004
They said they were aiming to go pro.

319
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,508
Yeah, well, everyone says that.

320
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,009
Yeah?

321
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:55,890
People who are successful say that
they didn't have to work hard at all.

322
00:16:56,933 --> 00:17:00,519
But if that was really the case,
anybody could be successful.

323
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:01,896
Exactly.

324
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,107
Tomo knows that too.

325
00:17:05,273 --> 00:17:08,694
That's why she kept saying that
we weren't good enough.

326
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,032
Since she believed
we all felt the same way,

327
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,911
she became more and more demanding.

328
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,955
Yeah, I can see that.

329
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:25,503
But you still stayed with her.

330
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:30,424
Though Tomo said she'd set out on her own.

331
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,469
But being so young...

332
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:37,807
Guarantor?

333
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,560
I don't plan to contact my parents.

334
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,436
I promise not to be a burden.

335
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,526
That's when we started living together

336
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,611
and formed beni-shouga together.

337
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,489
We had opportunities to go pro, but...

338
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:58,119
Each time, she'd butt heads
with someone and ruin it.

339
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:03,874
And because of that, I think she's become
scared to say how she feels.

340
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:08,838
That if she shared her true self,
it would ruin everything.

341
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:14,218
What do you think, Momoka?

342
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,221
My guitar skills.

343
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,474
Am I good enough to play on stage?

344
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:25,980
Are you serious?

345
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,236
I thought so.

346
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:39,577
I'm home.

347
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,497
You're late.

348
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,001
Oh! It's eating!

349
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,169
Look!

350
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,047
You're right!

351
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,759
No matter how scared you are,

352
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,805
you won't get anywhere
if you're just watching.

353
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,140
What do you mean?

354
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,517
Okay, Tomo.

355
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,978
Let's go for a walk.

356
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,152
It's not cooling down at all.

357
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,073
We're back to band practice tomorrow.

358
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,992
I hope it doesn't rain.

359
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,329
I'm not wrong.

360
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:27,041
I said she's bad because she is.

361
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,211
She's just not good enough.

362
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:35,549
Then why did you tell her
she could play on stage?

363
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:36,759
That's...

364
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,846
Because Nina's hoping to...

365
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,058
To play guitar on stage with Momoka.

366
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,646
That's why she asked you.

367
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,731
She wants to improve.

368
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,984
That's what they all say.

369
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,570
That they're serious, or want to improve.

370
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,699
But they end up just wanting compliments

371
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,077
or sing whatever way that feels good.

372
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,838
Can you hear that?

373
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:23,513
Ow.

374
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,268
Um...

375
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,604
Like this, this, and this.

376
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,857
Do what I tell you, stupid fingers!

377
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,488
I realized something

378
00:20:40,196 --> 00:20:42,450
when we saw the three of them play.

379
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,786
These people are serious.

380
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,373
It doesn't matter how good they are.

381
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,667
They give it their all on stage.

382
00:20:55,504 --> 00:21:00,468
I'm pretty sure
that's all you're looking for too.

383
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,147
You suck!

384
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,148
What...

385
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,409
I'm gonna get better!

386
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,417
You suck.

387
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,717
I love this sort of thing.

388
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:49,850
What's wrong?

389
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,896
It's just not feeling right.

390
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,189
What isn't?

391
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,692
It's fine.

392
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,986
Let's take a break.

393
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,071
Momoka.

394
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:07,535
I think this song is boring the way it is.

395
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,336
Right?

396
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:24,635
Never influenced by anybody
Never becoming anybody

397
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:27,638
I laughed, thinking it a dream

398
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:30,724
Numbed by the weakness I had forgotten

399
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,727
I can't even say that I'm lonely

400
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:39,400
This fragile heart
Vulnerable to even casual conversation

401
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:45,531
Is incapable of making anyone happy

402
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:52,788
But still, I feel a growing hope

403
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:58,752
Moving past all of the lies

404
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,172
I just want to hear
That I'm not wrong

405
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:05,301
I'm a dreamer, I'm young

406
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,929
I don't care if I'm still the same today

407
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,515
I just want to sing with you

408
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,893
My emotions stir so often

409
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,063
I've been hated

410
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,400
But I'm going to keep walking

411
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:27,573
Proud of myself
Who can never become anybody

412
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,784
Even if I'm alone

413
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:34,246
I believe in myself

414
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:41,253
Every time I get hurt, I just need to sing

415
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,887
