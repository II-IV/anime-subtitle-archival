00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:13,180
FREE STUDY

2
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,643
Are you really going to go help her?

3
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:18,727
Why?

4
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:20,562
It's not right.

5
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:24,066
She didn't do anything.
Why are they doing this to her?

6
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:26,610
Bullies don't need a good reason to bully.

7
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:29,071
If they don't like your attitude,
that's all it takes.

8
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,824
But she looked at me.

9
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,201
She wanted my help.

10
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,246
That's because
we were the only ones there.

11
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,624
If you go, I won't be able to help you.

12
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,878
You stop them and they'll target you next.

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,214
Then what about her?

14
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,215
I don't know.

15
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,426
Either she makes it through somehow
or stops coming to school.

16
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,637
Or a teacher notices and stops it.

17
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,639
You're saying to ignore it until then?

18
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,724
Why are you always like this?

19
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,228
You're so irritating.
I've had enough of this.

20
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,854
I've also had enough!

21
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,107
I get what you're saying, Hina.

22
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,566
But it's not right.

23
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:11,363
The people who are in the wrong
can't just get away with it.

24
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,117
I can't ignore it.

25
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,836
A dream...

26
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:30,632
Was I supposed to go to the agency today?

27
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,885
Crap, I overslept.

28
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,014
<i>This unfinished beat covers the night</i>

29
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,891
<i>Embracing us before we're crushed</i>

30
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:44,605
<i>Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand</i>

31
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,441
<i>There will be change
If you just reach out</i>

32
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:57,200
<i>Crying in a crowd with a voiceless voice</i>

33
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:01,455
<i>Come morning
The footsteps drown out the voice</i>

34
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:05,584
<i>No matter how much time passes
It never dries</i>

35
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:10,172
<i>The cold, muddy waters of a decaying city</i>

36
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:11,673
<i>In a world where nothing changes</i>

37
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,508
<i>We have to live through it</i>

38
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,804
<i>It may be dumb, but we have no choice</i>

39
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,556
<i>We've already started walking</i>

40
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:23,727
<i>It may seem unreal
It may seem stupid</i>

41
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,520
<i>This hopeless city of ours</i>

42
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,815
<i>But I still saw it with my own eyes</i>

43
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,693
<i>I touched it with these hands
See? See?</i>

44
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,988
<i>See? There it goes again
It's so stupid</i>

45
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,824
<i>Shine a light through
The hopeless darkness</i>

46
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,993
<i>This isn't a dream
Even in a dead city</i>

47
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,038
<i>Giving up won't change anything
Even now, now</i>

48
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:46,541
<i>Now, this unfinished beat covers the night</i>

49
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,377
<i>Embracing us before we're crushed</i>

50
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:54,132
<i>Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand</i>

51
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,802
<i>There will be change
If you just reach out</i>

52
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,523
I'll be blunt. We haven't
even reached half our projection.

53
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,899
That makes sense.

54
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,901
The video barely has any views.

55
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,278
Of course our subscriber count
hasn't grown.

56
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,739
What do you think about this, Ms. Miura?

57
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:23,912
The biggest issue is that you have more
exposure and recognition than before.

58
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,290
You also have a respectable number
of searches.

59
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:31,252
If you're being searched this much,
the song should have more traction.

60
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,004
But it doesn't.

61
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,256
It's the agency's responsibility.

62
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,426
Our promotion must be failing.

63
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,760
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,013
Please, that's not what I'm say...

65
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,224
In an age of self-publication,

66
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,436
talent agencies can't fall behind.

67
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:51,481
If we offer no benefits to artists,
they would leave us, right?

68
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:52,983
Yeah.

69
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,068
Please give me more time.

70
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,486
I'll think of a plan.

71
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,115
I've never seen Ms. Miura like that.

72
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,616
She did seem different.

73
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,493
Where's Momoka?

74
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,579
She said, "Sorry, gotta go."

75
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,289
What? She left?

76
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,374
I thought we were practicing later today.

77
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,626
Let's not today.

78
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:12,627
I agree.

79
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:13,378
Huh?

80
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,714
Momoka must have realized it.

81
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,382
I mean, obviously.

82
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,634
- Realized what?
- You're so slow.

83
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,053
- What?
- You heard what Ms. Miura said.

84
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,764
Our name's getting out there,
but not our song.

85
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,016
That means...

86
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,767
The song is the problem.

87
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:28,601
What?!

88
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,938
Ms. Miura realized
Momoka was going to say that,

89
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,732
so she was stopping her from saying it.

90
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:34,649
Why?

91
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:37,068
Because it would hurt Momoka's feelings.

92
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,404
No! Just give it time!

93
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:40,781
It's such a great song!

94
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,866
Everyone said so!

95
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,534
Ms. Miura and Mr. Nakata too!

96
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,746
Nobody would struggle
if that was enough to make a hit.

97
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:48,538
Still!

98
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:52,918
Like they say, Van Gogh only sold
one painting while he was alive.

99
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:53,877
But...

100
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,713
Ultimately,
people are influenced by trends.

101
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,008
They'll watch anything
if everyone says it's good.

102
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,886
And they won't watch something
nobody else is.

103
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,221
But that's...

104
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,722
It's true, right?

105
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,849
If there are videos about the same game,

106
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:11,520
would you watch the one
with 5,000 views or a million?

107
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:26,409
Stop that.

108
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,786
It's embarrassing.

109
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,621
I know that.

110
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,999
<i>"The band that
picked a fight they couldn't win."</i>

111
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,378
<i>"I hate how they're acting like
they're all that."</i>

112
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,380
<i>"Go away, losers!"</i>

113
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,216
Shut up!

114
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,178
Screw you,
I bet you didn't even listen to us!

115
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,806
And we're not losing to you!

116
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,058
It's got nothing to do with you all!

117
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,437
Calm down, calm down...

118
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,358
For the battle of the bands,

119
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:01,069
Diamond Dust sold out their show.

120
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,904
I mean, of course.

121
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,908
A follow request?

122
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:07,909
From Hina?

123
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,913
What?! It's a verified account.

124
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:21,964
Yo.

125
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,137
Made you look, dummy.

126
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,099
Long time no see.

127
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,226
You don't need a disguise?

128
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,605
I'm not that famous.

129
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,398
You still like these?

130
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,735
Yeah. We used to get these often
on our way home, didn't we?

131
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,986
I'll pay.

132
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,988
No, it's my treat.

133
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,617
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

134
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,119
I just figured you had the wrong idea.

135
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,120
What?

136
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:56,249
I didn't become Diamond Dust's
singer on purpose.

137
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,752
I told you I was auditioning.

138
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,005
Oh wait, that was after stopped talking.

139
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,257
And you stopped coming to school.

140
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,343
Did you come to brag?

141
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,512
That this happened
because I didn't listen to you?

142
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,891
That it wouldn't have come to this
if I only listened?

143
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,059
Correct.

144
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,269
...is what I'd like to say,
but that's not all.

145
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,023
- Your tickets aren't selling.
- That doesn't concern you.

146
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,484
I think it does.

147
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,277
We're playing a show together.

148
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,278
No, we aren't!

149
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:30,325
Your agent, Ms. Miura, came to us to talk.

150
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,910
Asking if we could do anything.

151
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:32,994
Ms. Miura did?

152
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,789
She asked if we would play both days

153
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,292
since we'd be able to sell tickets
without a problem.

154
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,421
She said you haven't sold enough
to fill 30% of the venue.

155
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:48,426
Our schedule's free, so it basically
comes down to our decision.

156
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:52,180
But I figured I'd get your opinion first.

157
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:53,723
So?

158
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,225
Whatever.

159
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,478
Does that mean not to do it?

160
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,981
Or are you saying you're grateful?

161
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,902
Can you hear that?

162
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,779
This is what it means to be a hit.

163
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:08,947
It's important.

164
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,407
Even crucial.

165
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,159
How about you acknowledge it already?

166
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,120
<i>That you were wrong.</i>

167
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,580
<i>That I was right.</i>

168
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,166
<i>That you should've listened.</i>

169
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,588
I thought you were going to bare it all.

170
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:30,385
Just admit you were wrong,
and I'll help you as much as you want.

171
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,679
I'm leaving!

172
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,349
Money!

173
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,602
Thanks for the popcorn!

174
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,066
Hello!

175
00:08:45,232 --> 00:08:46,818
Sorry to call you.

176
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:48,778
It's fine.

177
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,363
What is it?

178
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,491
Well, like I told everyone else...

179
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:58,371
D-D asked if we could play on both days
for the battle of the bands.

180
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,999
They want to play
for the same crowd against us.

181
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,003
Ms. Miura contacted you about that, right?

182
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,756
- Yes, what about it?
- Nothing.

183
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,131
What do you think, Nina?

184
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,884
What about all of you?

185
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,135
Well, I mean...

186
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:17,015
We didn't have a chance before, but
this would make things a bit more even.

187
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:20,268
But then, the competition wouldn't matter.

188
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:24,272
D-D would get credit
for the crowd that comes.

189
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:28,526
Isn't that the same as
us admitting defeat now?

190
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,029
So are you against it?

191
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,405
Yes, I am.

192
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:33,990
Here we go.

193
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,950
I get where you're coming from...

194
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,203
No! There's no way I'll agree!

195
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,956
Think of everything we went through!

196
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,541
Momoka's not wrong.

197
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,712
Our whole point was to prove that
her songs can reach people!

198
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,381
We came this far because we believed that.

199
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,134
But reality won't let us.

200
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,929
We haven't even sold enough tickets
to fill 30% of the venue.

201
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,390
That's worse than before the agency.

202
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,934
So what?

203
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,269
Are you gonna take responsibility then?

204
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,688
Do you know how much money this costs?

205
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,648
Money?

206
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,691
Not just the venue.

207
00:10:08,857 --> 00:10:13,279
We also made merchandise to sell
and marketing isn't free either.

208
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,491
We need to reduce our losses
as much as we can.

209
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,284
It's all my fault.

210
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,452
I'm sorry.

211
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,208
Does this mean
you'll bow your head to D-D too?

212
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,837
That's not what we're doing.

213
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,923
Yeah, we're just taking them up
on their offer.

214
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:32,881
We are bowing to them!

215
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,885
Do you really think D-D
made that offer to us?

216
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,261
What do you mean?

217
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,264
It's obvious.

218
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:41,850
Ms. Miura bowed her head and begged them.

219
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,604
To help us by playing with us.

220
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,232
Really? How do you know that?

221
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:53,903
Hina came to tell me
and told me to admit that I was wrong.

222
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,489
Then they'd help us as much as we wanted.

223
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,617
But I don't want to!

224
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,494
Because...

225
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,121
I wasn't wrong!

226
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,124
Nina.

227
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,628
So don't bow your heads to them!

228
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,557
Don't reject the person I was!

229
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,852
Money, responsibility, popularity!

230
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,688
I know that already!

231
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:32,066
I'm so mad and frustrated!

232
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,068
Just shut up already!

233
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,905
- Nina!
- Nina!

234
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:38,907
You okay?

235
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,827
Why am I so weak?

236
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,504
Did they do this to you?

237
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,550
I told you I can't help you.

238
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,803
Was what I did that upsetting for you?

239
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:05,266
You know, every time we talked,
I got this feeling

240
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:09,938
that you have this sense of justice
that you flaunt and hurt everyone with.

241
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,816
You make us feel like we're the bad guys.

242
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,736
You haven't talked since?

243
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:17,695
Right.

244
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,032
Well, that certainly sounds like you.

245
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:24,285
What happened to the girl
who was being bullied?

246
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:30,583
Funny thing is, she started bullying me
with her former bullies not long after.

247
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,671
Then she'd tell me privately
to apologize to them.

248
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,881
That they'd probably forgive me,

249
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,801
and I wouldn't have to go through this.

250
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,094
What the hell?

251
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,054
But she was shaking.

252
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,098
She was scared of them.

253
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,933
But you saved her.

254
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,768
She owes you, right?

255
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,104
So that's why you stopped going to school.

256
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,355
Yes.

257
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,857
Because you weren't wrong, huh?

258
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,025
But you were wrong!

259
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,236
You were clearly wrong!

260
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,237
Tomo...

261
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,446
Look at the results!

262
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,658
That Hina girl was obviously right!

263
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:04,993
But!

264
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,369
But...

265
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,123
I think that's why I was drawn to you.

266
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,041
I like your voice.

267
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,253
Rupa, Momoka, and Subaru, too, probably.

268
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,672
Tomo!

269
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,341
- Stop!
- Aw, come on!

270
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,719
I don't like these things!

271
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,471
We have our decision.

272
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,766
But Ms. Miura worked hard on this deal.

273
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,643
We need to take responsibility.

274
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,687
Seriously?

275
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:37,482
But I guess I knew it would turn out
this way from the beginning.

276
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,193
It's Nina after all.

277
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,778
Yeah, it is.

278
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:41,779
So mean.

279
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,366
You decline?

280
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,118
Yes, we're sorry.

281
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:50,872
They said they want to do
a proper battle of the bands.

282
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:56,502
We know, but it would look like
we're getting saved by them.

283
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:00,506
Even so, the audience would...

284
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,424
RESIGNATION

285
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,509
It's what we all decided.

286
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,263
We also know
how selfish of a decision this is,

287
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,558
and the loss to the agency
isn't insignificant.

288
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,144
Please let us know the cost
for this event.

289
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:18,149
I can't promise when,
but we will pay it back, so please.

290
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,026
Please.

291
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,696
Please raise your heads.

292
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:25,907
Please tell me why.

293
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:28,826
I got a message.

294
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,662
Hina from D-D contacted me directly.

295
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,040
I was happy to hear about your dedication,

296
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:38,753
that you would do this much when
I asked to take part in this competition.

297
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,632
And I do feel guilty about
turning this down despite everything.

298
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,052
I'm sorry for being selfish!

299
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:52,391
Honestly, I knew
it would go against your wishes.

300
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,643
Ms. Miura.

301
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,394
I'm a bad manager.

302
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,480
Don't get the wrong idea.

303
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,900
The agency and I will do something
about the money.

304
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:05,154
This is exactly why
I wanted to work with you.

305
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,824
Please let me help you one last time.

306
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,534
You're quitting?

307
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:10,785
Yes.

308
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:14,622
- You're changing agencies?
- No, we'll continue on our own.

309
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,374
Were you dissatisfied?

310
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,417
No.

311
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,585
It's just what we decided.

312
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,628
That's all.

313
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,383
You sound so naive.

314
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:31,431
Come back here
if you're still around in ten years.

315
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,890
I'll work for you for free.

316
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,770
Okay, thank you, Mr. Nakata!

317
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,022
Let's grab a beef bowl.

318
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,774
I bet you just want to drink.

319
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,276
Of course not.

320
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,194
You're not convincing.

321
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,906
This is where we first met you.

322
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,032
Yeah.

323
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,535
Beni-shoga, huh?

324
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,288
Want to make an oath on it?

325
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,249
It's an important name to the two of you,

326
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,042
so an oath just as important.

327
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,544
What oath are we making?

328
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,798
The five of us will stick together,
and we'll never quit.

329
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,634
I guess we have to eat here then.

330
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,760
I like it.

331
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,679
Just one drink.

332
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,306
Momoka!

333
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,559
I love this city.

334
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:22,231
I love this city where I met
lifelong friends I can laugh and cry with.

335
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,484
Kawasaki, right?

336
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,235
Yes!

337
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,577
<i>Call the game, we lost.</i>

338
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,496
<i>Like four consecutive losses
in the Japan series.</i>

339
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,540
<i>No miracle, huh?</i>

340
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,125
<i>Of course not.</i>

341
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,710
<i>This isn't a soap opera.</i>

342
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,003
<i>You watch soap operas?</i>

343
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,631
The only drama I watch
is <i>Detective Granny</i>!

344
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,467
Are you picking a fight?

345
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,761
But we knew this would happen.

346
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:56,140
That things were stacked against us,
and it wouldn't be easy.

347
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,808
You're one to talk.

348
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,561
You're the one who was the most clueless.

349
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:01,812
You got me there.

350
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,816
That's why you can say you weren't wrong.

351
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:06,817
Momoka.

352
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:11,030
D-D had their show last night,
so we got more comments.

353
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,491
You're the one who said not to look!

354
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,575
Now, now.

355
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:15,910
Let's see.

356
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,578
"I like this."

357
00:17:17,744 --> 00:17:20,080
"Why do they get so much hate?"

358
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:23,167
"Shut up, songs aren't about numbers."

359
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,711
"It's not over until it's over."

360
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:30,840
See, there are people who say these things
instead of staying quiet.

361
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,469
We really can reach people.

362
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,471
Yeah.

363
00:17:36,763 --> 00:17:40,476
But I didn't expect your guitar playing
to improve so much.

364
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,478
Yeah, what a surprise.

365
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,231
It's really okay for me to play?

366
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,317
You practiced so much in the park.

367
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,234
Seems fine.

368
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,654
Thanks, everyone.

369
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,240
Please get ready.

370
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,366
Okay.

371
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:00,371
NINA, LOOK UP
HINA

372
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:01,789
"Up"?

373
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,374
NOW LOOK LEFT
HINA

374
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,334
"Left"?

375
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:07,878
TOGENASHI TOGEARI

376
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,255
MADE YOU LOOK, DUMMY

377
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:10,756
That girl...

378
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,840
She's funny.

379
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:15,428
Maybe Hina didn't want you
to fold after all.

380
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,679
What do you mean?

381
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,390
She came all this way
to tell you to apologize

382
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,642
even though she knows you wouldn't.

383
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,561
True, Nina is like the final boss.

384
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,189
The universe's
most irritating Morality Demon King.

385
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:31,068
Beating you means the game's over,
but she still wants to play.

386
00:18:31,234 --> 00:18:32,820
That doesn't make me happy at all.

387
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,155
It's a compliment.

388
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,198
You know I'm right.

389
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,659
Everyone, it's time.

390
00:18:54,759 --> 00:19:00,097
Um, as you know,
we're competing against Diamond Dust.

391
00:19:00,263 --> 00:19:01,849
But you can see the results...

392
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,353
Thank you for coming today!

393
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,313
Ow...

394
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:13,152
To be honest, we cared about it a lot.

395
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,196
We wanted to beat Diamond Dust.

396
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:16,614
We didn't want to lose.

397
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,617
We really did our best
at the last music festival too.

398
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,996
Let me speak about myself for a moment.

399
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,248
Is that okay, Rupa?

400
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:31,504
Back in high school, I helped someone
who was being bullied.

401
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:36,258
<i>I was really happy as I left my classroom
to go save her.</i>

402
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:40,012
<i>I felt so proud,
and I loved myself for doing it.</i>

403
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,933
But because of that, I got bullied instead

404
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,143
and I ultimately dropped out of school.

405
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,939
But not once did I ever think
"I shouldn't have gone"

406
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:54,151
or "This wouldn't be happening
if I hadn't gone."

407
00:19:54,984 --> 00:19:56,278
That's when I realized...

408
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,698
I don't regret anything.

409
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,452
I became stronger
because of Momoka's song,

410
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,372
and I often talked about that to Hina...

411
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,085
Oh, I see.

412
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:16,215
<i>She liked D-D's songs too.</i>

413
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:18,759
<i>It wasn't just my song.</i>

414
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,719
<i>It reached her too.</i>

415
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,726
Once again, thank you so much
for coming today.

416
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,895
You are the contrarians
who came to see us.

417
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,148
But I love people like that.

418
00:20:33,898 --> 00:20:37,111
And I'll scream out that we haven't lost.

419
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:38,737
That we weren't wrong.

420
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:43,159
Please be the witnesses to our beginning!

421
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:52,792
<i>We're all the same
Living life</i>

422
00:20:52,960 --> 00:21:01,177
<i>If you don't have a place of your own
Go fly</i>

423
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:06,056
<i>Fate tangled up, reverberating
I had taken all other paths</i>

424
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:10,770
<i>I dedicate the rest of my life
To singing with you</i>

425
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:15,648
<i>No light or wind, like an isolated prison</i>

426
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:22,448
<i>Pain and suffering
Scars all over, I hated it all</i>

427
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,910
<i>Even with wings full of holes</i>

428
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:31,207
<i>Even in the depths of hell
I could sing with you</i>

429
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,628
<i>I flew away, wanting to disappear</i>

430
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,297
<i>But now I don't want to disappear</i>

431
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:42,593
<i>I picked the flower and kept it
Waiting for it to blossom</i>

432
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,846
<i>The version of me
Who wanted to disappear is gone</i>

433
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,349
<i>I'm glad I didn't disappear</i>

434
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:56,732
<i>Because I met you
Our flower of fate bloomed</i>

435
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,962
Ready?

436
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:22,174
Thank you!

437
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:29,640
<i>Never influenced by anybody
Never becoming anybody</i>

438
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:32,643
<i>I laughed, thinking it a dream</i>

439
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,729
<i>Numbed by the weakness I had forgotten</i>

440
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,732
<i>I can't even say that I'm lonely</i>

441
00:22:38,898 --> 00:22:44,405
<i>This fragile heart
Vulnerable to even casual conversation</i>

442
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:50,536
<i>Is incapable of making anyone happy</i>

443
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:57,792
<i>But still, I feel a growing hope</i>

444
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,757
<i>Moving past all of the lies</i>

445
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:07,177
<i>I just want to hear
That I'm not wrong</i>

446
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,306
<i>I'm a dreamer, I'm young</i>

447
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,934
<i>I don't care if I'm still the same today</i>

448
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,520
<i>I just want to sing with you</i>

449
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,898
<i>My emotions stir so often</i>

450
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:23,068
<i>I've been hated</i>

451
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:26,405
<i>But I'm going to keep walking</i>

452
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:32,578
<i>Proud of myself
Who can never become anybody</i>

453
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:35,789
<i>Even if I'm alone</i>

454
00:23:35,955 --> 00:23:39,251
<i>I believe in myself</i>

455
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:46,258
<i>Every time I get hurt, I just need to sing</i>
