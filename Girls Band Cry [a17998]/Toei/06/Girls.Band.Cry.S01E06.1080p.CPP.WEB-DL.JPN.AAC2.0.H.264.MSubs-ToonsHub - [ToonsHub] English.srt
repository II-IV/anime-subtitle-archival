1
00:00:15,123 --> 00:00:17,375
In this ever-changing world

2
00:00:17,542 --> 00:00:21,963
What should we come up with?

3
00:00:24,882 --> 00:00:26,467
I'm turning off the AC.

4
00:00:30,555 --> 00:00:31,639
Okay, let's start.

5
00:00:31,806 --> 00:00:32,598
Okay.

6
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:35,810
Playback.

7
00:00:50,908 --> 00:00:52,118
Seriously!

8
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:57,749
The song gets harder when you make
the melody using a Vocaloid.

9
00:00:57,915 --> 00:01:01,794
I really like this melody line you wrote,

10
00:01:02,337 --> 00:01:05,757
so maybe we should
find a vocalist who can sing it.

11
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:09,636
I told you no.

12
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:11,137
I see.

13
00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:14,098
Then I suppose that's it.

14
00:01:14,265 --> 00:01:18,561
We'll just have to continue
making music on our own.

15
00:01:19,937 --> 00:01:22,106
I'll go take the trash out.

16
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:23,900
Rupa.

17
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,276
Yes?

18
00:01:25,443 --> 00:01:27,904
Are you wanting to try?

19
00:01:28,654 --> 00:01:29,989
Look at this.

20
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:33,660
BENI-SHOUGA
WE MAKE MUSIC.

21
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:35,411
22,738 FOLLOWERS

22
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,293
If you're serious about pursuing
your dream...

23
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,964
BUDOKAN, HERE WE COME!

24
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:50,093
This unfinished beat covers the night

25
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:52,970
Embracing us before we're crushed

26
00:01:53,137 --> 00:01:57,684
Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand

27
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,520
There will be change
If you just reach out

28
00:02:06,317 --> 00:02:10,279
Crying in a crowd with a voiceless voice

29
00:02:10,446 --> 00:02:14,534
Come morning
The footsteps drown out the voice

30
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:18,663
No matter how much time passes
It never dries

31
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,251
The cold, muddy waters of a decaying city

32
00:02:23,418 --> 00:02:24,752
In a world where nothing changes

33
00:02:26,254 --> 00:02:27,588
We have to live through it

34
00:02:28,756 --> 00:02:30,883
It may be dumb, but we have no choice

35
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,636
We've already started walking

36
00:02:33,803 --> 00:02:36,806
It may seem unreal
It may seem stupid

37
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:39,600
This hopeless city of ours

38
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:41,894
But I still saw it with my own eyes

39
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,772
I touched it with these hands
See? See?

40
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:48,067
See? There it goes again
It's so stupid

41
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,903
Shine a light through
The hopeless darkness

42
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,072
This isn't a dream
Even in a dead city

43
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,117
Giving up won't change anything
Even now, now

44
00:02:56,284 --> 00:02:59,620
Now, this unfinished beat covers the night

45
00:02:59,787 --> 00:03:02,457
Embracing us before we're crushed

46
00:03:02,623 --> 00:03:07,211
Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand

47
00:03:07,377 --> 00:03:09,881
There will be change
If you just reach out

48
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:19,389
BATH HOUSE

49
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:22,018
How's your voice?

50
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:25,980
Much better.

51
00:03:26,147 --> 00:03:28,274
Doesn't sound like it.

52
00:03:30,693 --> 00:03:34,739
You two, come in the sauna,
it's good for your throat.

53
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,872
You won't last
if you wreck your voice every time.

54
00:03:43,372 --> 00:03:44,707
For sure. Ow...

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,001
Does it hurt?

56
00:03:47,543 --> 00:03:50,171
When this pain feels like home,

57
00:03:50,338 --> 00:03:52,673
it makes the performance feel real.

58
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,758
Ow!

59
00:03:54,884 --> 00:03:58,137
Still, that was a crazy show.

60
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,306
It was fun though.

61
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,558
Nina really let loose.

62
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:04,644
You went pretty hard too.

63
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,647
Pleia on the drums!

64
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:10,441
I'm Pleia!

65
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:11,901
Zing!

66
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:16,029
I can't use my real name!

67
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:17,698
Personas are important.

68
00:04:17,865 --> 00:04:20,493
Pleia the high school girl!

69
00:04:21,452 --> 00:04:24,539
I'm getting out now.

70
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:33,005
She's really obsessed with it.

71
00:04:33,464 --> 00:04:35,174
- You mean, Nina?
- Yeah.

72
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:36,592
Is that bad?

73
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,303
It's not that.

74
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,431
Momoka!

75
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:43,599
Huh?

76
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:46,561
I'll read some of the reactions
to our show.

77
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,189
"Momoka really is Diamond Dust."

78
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:54,360
"Her new band's way more rock
than the current Diamond Dust."

79
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:58,197
Wow, they say you're cute, Nina.

80
00:04:58,363 --> 00:04:59,657
Well, thanks.

81
00:04:59,824 --> 00:05:04,202
Anyway, the audience likes
the old Diamond Dust better.

82
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:06,998
So?

83
00:05:07,164 --> 00:05:07,957
What?!

84
00:05:08,124 --> 00:05:12,503
You want to make a post trashing
the current Diamond Dust as posers?

85
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:16,214
That they should support us
because we are more authentic?

86
00:05:17,008 --> 00:05:18,175
You don't want to?

87
00:05:18,342 --> 00:05:19,969
Are you serious?

88
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:22,221
Do you know how many followers they have?

89
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:23,598
Just look.

90
00:05:25,474 --> 00:05:26,559
20,000.

91
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:27,601
It went up.

92
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:29,353
And how many do we have?

93
00:05:30,104 --> 00:05:31,480
500.

94
00:05:31,647 --> 00:05:33,190
There you go.

95
00:05:33,357 --> 00:05:35,568
So what do we do?

96
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:36,527
Nothing.

97
00:05:36,694 --> 00:05:39,779
Just do what we've been doing,
practice when we can,

98
00:05:39,947 --> 00:05:42,116
make songs, and do shows...

99
00:05:42,283 --> 00:05:43,868
And then what?

100
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:48,497
What's the goal for our band?

101
00:05:48,956 --> 00:05:50,374
Aren't you going to go to college?

102
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:53,169
I'm asking about your goals.

103
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:54,754
What a pain.

104
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,008
Don't ruin my mood when
I just got done taking a relaxing bath.

105
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:01,636
But I kinda want to know too.

106
00:06:02,637 --> 00:06:06,015
I mean, you used to be a professional.

107
00:06:06,182 --> 00:06:12,396
It's a little strange that someone like
that would be in a band with us amateurs.

108
00:06:12,563 --> 00:06:14,982
Do you have something in mind?

109
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:17,526
No, not really.

110
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:19,612
So no goal either?

111
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,197
Nope.

112
00:06:22,573 --> 00:06:24,158
I'm so ticked off.

113
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:26,619
I'm so ticked off!

114
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,245
You're getting rice everywhere.

115
00:06:30,206 --> 00:06:34,877
What's her deal?! Every time I try to have
a serious discussion with her...

116
00:06:35,044 --> 00:06:37,380
You like to charge at people too much.

117
00:06:39,882 --> 00:06:42,510
It's like you're a bull.

118
00:06:42,677 --> 00:06:43,636
Moo.

119
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,639
There's no way
she'll open up like that.

120
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,641
Then what do I do?

121
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:52,144
Make a situation
where she can open up

122
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:53,771
and let her do it gradually.

123
00:06:53,938 --> 00:06:54,980
Liar.

124
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:56,774
I'm not lying about this!

125
00:06:59,694 --> 00:07:03,531
But I wonder how she actually feels.

126
00:07:03,698 --> 00:07:07,910
What is it that you want to do
with this band anyway?

127
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:11,288
- I mean...
- You want to beat Diamond Dust?

128
00:07:13,082 --> 00:07:14,917
That's a high bar.

129
00:07:15,084 --> 00:07:17,420
They're pros that have
an agency behind them.

130
00:07:18,087 --> 00:07:19,296
What do you want to do?

131
00:07:21,549 --> 00:07:23,050
I'm home.

132
00:07:30,224 --> 00:07:32,768
Band. Goal.

133
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:37,606
How to become a professional band.

134
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:38,566
HOW TO START A BAND

135
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:44,572
Professional?

136
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:45,698
Yes.

137
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,325
You starting to feel ambitious?

138
00:07:48,492 --> 00:07:52,121
It's not like we've had any offers.

139
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:54,206
I'm just curious.

140
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,460
It used to be that scouts
would come out to the venues

141
00:07:57,626 --> 00:08:01,589
or you would send in audition tapes,

142
00:08:01,756 --> 00:08:05,843
but these days directly contacting
bands popular online is the norm.

143
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,846
Is a talent agency that important?

144
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:10,264
Yeah.

145
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:13,309
You can release songs online,

146
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:16,854
but when it comes to collaborations
and promotions...

147
00:08:17,021 --> 00:08:21,275
I suppose you should strive to reach
the indie band days of Diamond Dust.

148
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:25,654
They had about 10,000 followers
back when they were still a local band.

149
00:08:26,197 --> 00:08:28,449
That's how they got noticed by agencies.

150
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,368
So it just comes down to numbers.

151
00:08:31,535 --> 00:08:32,745
I mean, yeah.

152
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,872
Followers represent crowd potential.

153
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,625
When it's high,
interested parties approach you.

154
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:38,626
471 FOLLOWERS

155
00:08:38,793 --> 00:08:40,127
It went down?

156
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,923
...not to hear

157
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,134
Look, it's passing us by

158
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:50,471
The city flows down a whirlpool of truth

159
00:08:50,638 --> 00:08:53,724
Where should we float to?

160
00:08:53,891 --> 00:08:56,434
If we can smile when we arrive

161
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,854
Then let's hold hands

162
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:00,606
It's not a dream

163
00:09:01,273 --> 00:09:04,068
"I don't want to risk losing
what we have."

164
00:09:04,235 --> 00:09:07,363
"I'd rather stay where I am than suffer."

165
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,783
There's nothing wrong with thinking that.

166
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,994
But in that case,
you need to take that down.

167
00:09:14,537 --> 00:09:15,621
It's absurd.

168
00:09:18,874 --> 00:09:21,293
Rupa, do you think it'll work out?

169
00:09:21,836 --> 00:09:23,587
There's no way to know.

170
00:09:23,754 --> 00:09:27,341
Close friends can end up
fighting and split up.

171
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:30,553
While incompatible members
somehow stay together.

172
00:09:32,721 --> 00:09:37,601
But I think the three of them
are a good fit for you.

173
00:09:37,768 --> 00:09:38,561
Why?

174
00:09:39,144 --> 00:09:40,062
Just a feeling.

175
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,820
Anything else you want to do?

176
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,614
Considering we need to clean up,
we should call it a day.

177
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,074
That's true.

178
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:54,076
That okay, Nina?

179
00:09:55,703 --> 00:09:56,495
Nina?

180
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:57,453
Um...

181
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:01,583
Can we start thinking about
outfits for our next shows?

182
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,377
I mean, sure.

183
00:10:03,544 --> 00:10:05,880
You chose them for our last performance.

184
00:10:06,046 --> 00:10:11,343
Yes, but I'm thinking about
something cuter for next time.

185
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,845
Cuter?

186
00:10:13,011 --> 00:10:17,850
Also, can I upload the picture I took
of you earlier to social media?

187
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,352
Oh, nice!

188
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,855
You're glowing.

189
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:25,732
It will attract lots of followers...

190
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,568
Of course not!

191
00:10:27,735 --> 00:10:29,778
I thought since you seemed into it...

192
00:10:29,945 --> 00:10:31,614
Post your own picture!

193
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:32,948
Sorry.

194
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:36,118
I thought maybe fans
would like this better.

195
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:38,495
What if my grandma sees?!

196
00:10:38,662 --> 00:10:40,748
You want to gain followers that badly?

197
00:10:40,915 --> 00:10:42,708
It's important to draw a crowd.

198
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:46,503
Then we can try wearing
high school uniforms.

199
00:10:47,004 --> 00:10:49,881
Call ourselves
the Shinkawasaki Girls' School.

200
00:10:50,925 --> 00:10:53,636
It'd be a scam
if you wore one though, Momoka.

201
00:10:53,802 --> 00:10:55,011
Just let her have this.

202
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:56,054
I'll kick you.

203
00:10:56,931 --> 00:10:59,516
But if that will get us followers...

204
00:10:59,683 --> 00:11:01,936
Are you serious?

205
00:11:02,102 --> 00:11:06,398
Wouldn't that be the same
as the current Diamond Dust?

206
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,107
I know that.

207
00:11:08,275 --> 00:11:12,571
But it's hard to reach their level
of success without going pro.

208
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,908
And for that, we need a strong fan base.

209
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:18,285
Since when is that our goal?

210
00:11:18,452 --> 00:11:22,164
Because we won't be able to beat
Diamond Dust otherwise!

211
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:25,042
Like I said, when did it become
about beating them?

212
00:11:30,255 --> 00:11:31,423
I keep telling you.

213
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,134
I don't hold a grudge against them.

214
00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:36,178
It's me who doesn't want to lose.

215
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:37,429
Like I care.

216
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:42,059
Don't put your personal vendettas on us.

217
00:11:42,726 --> 00:11:43,936
I know.

218
00:11:44,102 --> 00:11:47,815
But I really don't want to lose.

219
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,618
Look, I get where you're coming from.

220
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,203
Good evening!

221
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,664
But suddenly wanting to go pro?

222
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,958
I know things won't immediately
work out if we go pro.

223
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,586
Nor do I think we'll beat Diamond Dust.

224
00:12:09,753 --> 00:12:13,465
But I hate admitting defeat
and giving up from the start.

225
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:15,884
Because we're not wrong.

226
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:19,554
Medium bowl, no onions, please.

227
00:12:20,014 --> 00:12:21,932
One medium bowl for me, please.

228
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:23,684
Okay, two medium bowls...

229
00:12:27,855 --> 00:12:28,897
What?

230
00:12:30,732 --> 00:12:31,692
Nice to meet you.

231
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,653
Girls Band Cry.

232
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,033
You two play music?

233
00:12:39,575 --> 00:12:41,035
Let me introduce myself.

234
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,415
Hi. I'm Rupa.

235
00:12:46,582 --> 00:12:48,167
And this is Tomo Ebizuka.

236
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,170
We've been making songs
together for a while.

237
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,131
I've seen this before.

238
00:12:54,298 --> 00:12:56,383
People were buzzing about it.

239
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:00,679
The faces were hidden,
so it was you two, huh?

240
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,181
So cute.

241
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,932
Thank you.

242
00:13:04,475 --> 00:13:06,268
Did you come to us because...?

243
00:13:06,434 --> 00:13:07,811
A battle of the bands?

244
00:13:07,977 --> 00:13:08,812
No.

245
00:13:08,979 --> 00:13:09,938
To complain?

246
00:13:10,105 --> 00:13:10,939
No.

247
00:13:11,106 --> 00:13:13,442
I know, we're the 10,000th customer!

248
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:14,568
No.

249
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:18,447
You're kinda slow.

250
00:13:18,614 --> 00:13:20,616
We're here to scout you.

251
00:13:21,158 --> 00:13:22,910
- The power level detector.
- No.

252
00:13:23,077 --> 00:13:24,828
We're scouting you!

253
00:13:24,995 --> 00:13:26,246
Scout?

254
00:13:26,413 --> 00:13:27,206
Who is?

255
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,208
Scouting who?

256
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:35,130
You're poaching her?

257
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:36,131
No!

258
00:13:36,298 --> 00:13:39,885
We're asking if all three of you
want to work with us!

259
00:13:40,803 --> 00:13:42,346
- No way.
- Way.

260
00:13:42,513 --> 00:13:44,848
We went to see your last live show.

261
00:13:45,015 --> 00:13:46,558
No way.

262
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,102
The two of us talked it over,

263
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:51,855
and we decided we want to play with you.

264
00:13:52,022 --> 00:13:53,482
No way!

265
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:55,442
Vocabularily stunted.

266
00:13:56,568 --> 00:14:02,116
But we don't draw a crowd,
and our fan base is still small.

267
00:14:02,282 --> 00:14:04,243
We're the same.

268
00:14:04,701 --> 00:14:06,245
The same boat, huh?

269
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:09,873
But we still had a few agencies
reach out to us.

270
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,208
Wow.

271
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,420
Yes, but as we talked,

272
00:14:14,586 --> 00:14:19,133
none of them really matched
with what we were looking for.

273
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:23,137
They just latch on
to what sells right now.

274
00:14:23,303 --> 00:14:25,514
That's going a bit far.

275
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:28,892
At the very least,
they weren't a good fit with Tomo.

276
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:30,727
So that's why you approached us?

277
00:14:30,894 --> 00:14:36,483
Yes, after seeing your show,
we realized you only sing what you want.

278
00:14:37,025 --> 00:14:39,403
That you'd voice your opinions.

279
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,029
Really?

280
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:42,322
Were we wrong?

281
00:14:42,489 --> 00:14:44,908
No, that's how I sang.

282
00:14:45,075 --> 00:14:47,494
Nina really knows how to let off steam.

283
00:14:49,746 --> 00:14:50,998
Come in.

284
00:14:51,165 --> 00:14:53,000
- Excuse us.
- Excuse us.

285
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:55,669
Hold on, I'll turn the light on.

286
00:14:55,836 --> 00:14:56,753
Okay.

287
00:14:57,171 --> 00:14:57,963
This way?

288
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:58,922
Ow.

289
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:00,549
Don't wander around.

290
00:15:00,716 --> 00:15:02,259
Excuse me.

291
00:15:02,426 --> 00:15:03,427
Huh?

292
00:15:03,594 --> 00:15:04,678
What's this?

293
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:08,432
- It's a lizard!
- Gecko!

294
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:11,310
I see your goal is to play at the Budokan.

295
00:15:12,352 --> 00:15:13,270
Budokan?

296
00:15:13,437 --> 00:15:14,479
W-What?

297
00:15:14,646 --> 00:15:16,773
There's nothing wrong with that,
is there?

298
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,817
Nothing wrong at all.

299
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,777
It's really amazing actually.

300
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:24,072
It never even crossed my mind.

301
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:25,574
Yeah.

302
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:31,330
Is the Budokan big?

303
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,081
You don't know?

304
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:37,336
I mean, I've heard of it
and seen it on TV.

305
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,587
A country bumpkin...

306
00:15:38,754 --> 00:15:40,923
Tomo's from Sendai though.

307
00:15:41,632 --> 00:15:42,549
Sendai city?

308
00:15:42,716 --> 00:15:43,842
I'm from Kumamoto!

309
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,011
What? Sendai in Miyagi!

310
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:47,387
Oh.

311
00:15:49,598 --> 00:15:52,893
Do you guys want to go check it out?

312
00:15:53,644 --> 00:15:54,728
What?

313
00:15:55,229 --> 00:15:58,732
Why did we have to come here this late?

314
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:02,236
It's important to close the distance.

315
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:09,243
BUDOKAN

316
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,745
If we could sing here...

317
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,166
If we could sing here

318
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,961
then we'll be able to feel
that we weren't wrong.

319
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:21,880
We could say we aren't losing
to Diamond Dust.

320
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:23,548
I'm sure.

321
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:29,805
Budokan, here we come!

322
00:16:34,184 --> 00:16:36,019
So, what are we going to do?

323
00:16:36,186 --> 00:16:38,272
Let's call Momoka!

324
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:41,817
- Are you stupid?
- Why?

325
00:16:41,984 --> 00:16:46,613
Momoka said she wanted
a bass and keyboard player!

326
00:16:47,864 --> 00:16:49,741
But their dream is the Budokan.

327
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,035
It means wanting to go pro.

328
00:16:52,202 --> 00:16:54,538
Do you think Momoka would agree to that?

329
00:16:54,705 --> 00:16:56,748
Then what should we do?

330
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,041
Good question.

331
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:01,169
I think I'll tell her after all.

332
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:02,629
An opening.

333
00:17:03,213 --> 00:17:06,174
Is that all you can think of?
Morality Monster.

334
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,802
But there's no other way.

335
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:11,763
What?

336
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:12,931
Is there?

337
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:15,100
You won't call me a liar?

338
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,059
Huh?

339
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:19,646
I'll tell you if you don't call me a liar.

340
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,734
Look forward and take a step

341
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:26,320
They're good.

342
00:17:26,987 --> 00:17:30,949
There's proper top-end isolation,
and effective rests.

343
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:31,907
Right?

344
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:34,328
And they're bass and keyboard players.

345
00:17:34,494 --> 00:17:38,373
Seems perfect to try making
one song together at least.

346
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:39,958
What do you think?

347
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,960
What are they saying?

348
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:45,297
They're really up for it!

349
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:49,259
They want to try jamming
together this Sunday.

350
00:17:49,426 --> 00:17:50,218
Are you free?

351
00:17:50,385 --> 00:17:51,178
Probably.

352
00:17:51,345 --> 00:17:53,388
I'll send you the details later.

353
00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:55,599
Liar!

354
00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:56,975
It's a strategy!

355
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:01,605
- Which is it?
- Well, she's in and she's out.

356
00:18:01,772 --> 00:18:03,106
What's that mean?

357
00:18:03,273 --> 00:18:06,026
Just from what I could tell.

358
00:18:06,193 --> 00:18:08,862
I think there are two different Momokas.

359
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:13,116
When she's making music,
she's serious and dedicated,

360
00:18:13,282 --> 00:18:15,494
wanting to create something great.

361
00:18:16,286 --> 00:18:19,790
She wants to see if her songs
can resonate with people.

362
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:25,379
But when she drifts away from music,
she comes to her senses.

363
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,633
Realizing she stepped down
from music once already.

364
00:18:30,258 --> 00:18:34,679
I think she's wondering if there's
any point in taking this so seriously.

365
00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:35,806
I see.

366
00:18:35,972 --> 00:18:37,474
Who cares.

367
00:18:37,641 --> 00:18:39,476
Can we play together or not?

368
00:18:39,643 --> 00:18:40,852
I don't know.

369
00:18:41,436 --> 00:18:46,191
But I feel like she'll give in
if it looks like we'll be a good band.

370
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,859
She's a musician through and through.

371
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,070
I see.

372
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:52,739
I understand.

373
00:18:52,906 --> 00:18:55,242
Do we have to get ready now?
So annoying.

374
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:56,618
Huh? What do you mean?

375
00:18:56,785 --> 00:18:59,496
Just do as I tell you.

376
00:19:01,832 --> 00:19:03,500
DAYS LATER

377
00:19:07,462 --> 00:19:08,672
Are you ready?

378
00:19:09,631 --> 00:19:11,883
It's nice to play in a studio.

379
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,678
There's something weird
with this cable.

380
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:17,763
Granny?

381
00:19:18,306 --> 00:19:20,767
Wait, this picture!

382
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:22,227
Is it real?

383
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,146
How did you get a picture with her?

384
00:19:24,311 --> 00:19:25,397
Are you a fan?

385
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:30,819
Yes, Tomo watches it about
three times whenever it's on TV.

386
00:19:31,778 --> 00:19:33,696
She always cries at the end.

387
00:19:33,864 --> 00:19:36,199
You don't need to mention that.

388
00:19:37,284 --> 00:19:40,287
Still, getting a picture like this...

389
00:19:40,454 --> 00:19:43,915
Tendo Awa is famous for being
distant with her fans.

390
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:44,875
Awa?

391
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:46,460
Yes.

392
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:48,670
Okay, I need details.

393
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:49,629
Yo.

394
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:51,756
What?

395
00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:53,133
You're late.

396
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,259
Nice to meet you.

397
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,178
I'm the bass player, Rupa.

398
00:19:56,344 --> 00:19:58,096
This is Tomo, she plays keyboard.

399
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:59,763
You're from the beef bowl...

400
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:02,517
Thank you for your patronage.

401
00:20:02,684 --> 00:20:05,604
Order something other than
a medium bowl and beer sometime!

402
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,231
Good to have you.

403
00:20:08,398 --> 00:20:09,648
I'm Kawaragi, I play guitar.

404
00:20:09,816 --> 00:20:12,819
Former Diamond Dust member
Momoka Kawaragi!

405
00:20:12,986 --> 00:20:15,155
We'll get back to you later.

406
00:20:18,032 --> 00:20:19,576
So what are we playing?

407
00:20:19,743 --> 00:20:22,244
Can we play the song from our last show?

408
00:20:22,412 --> 00:20:24,830
Sure, but can the two of them play it?

409
00:20:24,998 --> 00:20:29,586
Yes, we listened and practiced a bit
before you arrived.

410
00:20:29,753 --> 00:20:31,671
I'll be changing it up a little.

411
00:20:32,172 --> 00:20:33,173
Is that okay?

412
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,174
One second.

413
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,010
I guess we'll give it a try.

414
00:20:37,177 --> 00:20:38,261
Okay.

415
00:20:39,262 --> 00:20:40,972
Okay, ready.

416
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,226
One, two, three, four.

417
00:20:51,441 --> 00:20:52,484
Wow.

418
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:53,777
What is this?

419
00:20:53,944 --> 00:20:54,736
Wow.

420
00:20:57,781 --> 00:21:00,867
The city flows down a whirlpool of truth

421
00:21:01,034 --> 00:21:04,162
Where should we float to?

422
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,915
In this ever-changing world

423
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:11,419
What should we come up with?

424
00:21:21,388 --> 00:21:23,181
Um, Momoka.

425
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:28,645
The two of them are actually wondering
if we want to be in a band together.

426
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:32,398
I want to try.

427
00:21:32,566 --> 00:21:34,317
You weren't wrong.

428
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:37,153
Your songs are just as good!

429
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,071
I want to prove it to everyone!

430
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:45,119
A festival?

431
00:21:45,287 --> 00:21:48,164
The first step is getting attention there.

432
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:51,001
There's an amateur section.

433
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:55,171
We apply, get selected,
play on stage, and make waves.

434
00:21:55,338 --> 00:21:58,258
Then an agency would reach out?

435
00:21:58,425 --> 00:21:59,259
Yes.

436
00:21:59,926 --> 00:22:03,638
Music producers flock to festivals.

437
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:05,724
They'll come to look.

438
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,393
For a diamond in the rough.

439
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,853
We'd play here?

440
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,148
Diamond Dust.

441
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,701
Never influenced by anybody
Never becoming anybody

442
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:27,704
I laughed, thinking it a dream

443
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:30,790
Numbed by the weakness I had forgotten

444
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:33,792
I can't even say that I'm lonely

445
00:22:34,002 --> 00:22:39,507
This fragile heart
Vulnerable to even casual conversation

446
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:45,638
Is incapable of making anyone happy

447
00:22:46,973 --> 00:22:52,854
But still, I feel a growing hope

448
00:22:53,063 --> 00:22:58,818
Moving past all of the lies

449
00:22:59,027 --> 00:23:02,238
I just want to hear
That I'm not wrong

450
00:23:02,446 --> 00:23:05,367
I'm a dreamer, I'm young

451
00:23:05,575 --> 00:23:08,994
I don't care if I'm still the same today

452
00:23:09,204 --> 00:23:11,580
I just want to sing with you

453
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,959
My emotions stir so often

454
00:23:15,167 --> 00:23:18,129
I've been hated

455
00:23:18,338 --> 00:23:21,465
But I'm going to keep walking

456
00:23:21,675 --> 00:23:27,681
Proud of myself
Who can never become anybody

457
00:23:28,348 --> 00:23:30,850
Even if I'm alone

458
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:34,311
I believe in myself

459
00:23:34,521 --> 00:23:41,361
Every time I get hurt, I just need to sing

460
00:23:48,284 --> 00:23:50,704
Next episode, "I'll Give It a Name"
