1
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:16,517
Dropping out of middle school
seems bad though.

2
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,893
Can't we wait until we graduate?

3
00:00:19,393 --> 00:00:21,188
Well, the guy at the live house told us

4
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:24,524
that there are countless cases
of people getting nowhere

5
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,653
after hesitating too long.

6
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:30,697
But what will our parents say?

7
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:31,949
How about taking a gap year?

8
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:33,951
Oh, that could be good.

9
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,954
We record an album then go back to school.

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,287
No.

11
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,333
Trust me, it's going to work out.

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,335
The people at the agency told us.

13
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,712
We're a revolutionary girl band,

14
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,632
and we'd make it big out in Tokyo.

15
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,717
That they'll help us debut.

16
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,303
I can't imagine it going that well.

17
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,596
Me either.

18
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,724
They didn't ask us
to drop out of school, right?

19
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,725
Then...

20
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:02,729
I told you, that's no good.

21
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,233
So much confidence.

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,736
If we create a contingency plan,
we'll want to run to it.

23
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:13,740
The more escape routes we have,
the less motivated we'll be.

24
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,492
But...

25
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:21,373
Because it's hard, it's important
to not have any escape routes!

26
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,125
Momokan.

27
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,296
Hey! Hold on!

28
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,553
We're gonna make it!

29
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,393
Does anyone need a bathroom break?

30
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,022
She's asking you, Momoka.

31
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,023
Shut up.

32
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:47,774
Then answer her.

33
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,403
Why you!

34
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,197
Don't provoke her!

35
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,160
Take the pit stop.

36
00:01:58,327 --> 00:01:59,828
Okay.

37
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,041
This unfinished beat covers the night

38
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,918
Embracing us before we're crushed

39
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:11,631
Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand

40
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,468
There will be change
If you just reach out

41
00:02:20,264 --> 00:02:24,227
Crying in a crowd with a voiceless voice

42
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:28,482
Come morning
The footsteps drown out the voice

43
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:32,611
No matter how much time passes
It never dries

44
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:37,199
The cold, muddy waters of a decaying city

45
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:38,700
In a world where nothing changes

46
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:41,536
We have to live through it

47
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,831
It may be dumb, but we have no choice

48
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,584
We've already started walking

49
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,754
It may seem unreal
It may seem stupid

50
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,548
This hopeless city of ours

51
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,842
But I still saw it with my own eyes

52
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:58,720
I touched it with these hands
See? See?

53
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:02,014
See? There it goes again
It's so stupid

54
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,851
Shine a light through
The hopeless darkness

55
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,020
This isn't a dream
Even in a dead city

56
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,065
Giving up won't change anything
Even now, now

57
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:13,568
Now, this unfinished beat covers the night

58
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,405
Embracing us before we're crushed

59
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:21,159
Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand

60
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,829
There will be change
If you just reach out

61
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,046
First, apologize.

62
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,005
Excuse me?

63
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,757
Yeah, that makes sense.

64
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,885
What? You're taking her side?

65
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,679
There are no sides here.

66
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,890
But you shouldn't have
said all that there.

67
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,560
The stage is for the audience.

68
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,270
The most important place.

69
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:51,523
Not the place to spill
your personal situation!

70
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,025
That's exactly why I wanted to say it there

71
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:55,902
to you, Momoka!

72
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,408
Both of you sit down. People are staring.

73
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,911
You're not innocent either, Subaru.
Why didn't you stop her?

74
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,081
Me? As if I could stop her.

75
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,917
This is embarrassing,
I'm going back to the car.

76
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,547
We should welcome internal conflict.

77
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,092
This is all your fault, Momoka.

78
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,260
My fault?

79
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,303
Yes!

80
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,432
You said you're quitting and that
it was your last without warning!

81
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:29,561
I don't want to hear it from someone
who suddenly decided we're going pro.

82
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,646
You're both at fault.

83
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:35,734
You're the one who made this complicated!

84
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:36,985
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,069
Anyway,

86
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,821
I'm not quitting.

87
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,407
You're free to get all worked up,

88
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,075
but you'll regret it later.

89
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,829
Do you have any idea
how popular Diamond Dust is?

90
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,875
That doesn't mean I want to just give up.

91
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,962
I don't want to say that we were wrong.

92
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,882
Face reality.

93
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,969
You're the one turning a blind eye
and running away.

94
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,346
Shut up.

95
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:07,057
What do you know about me?

96
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,808
Then tell me!

97
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,726
Why did you keep playing music?

98
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,772
If you thought your music was no good,

99
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:16,233
why didn't you move back home?

100
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,777
Why did you start a new band?

101
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,656
Whatever, you need to go back
to cram school.

102
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,116
No.

103
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,204
Then do whatever you want.

104
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,916
You're running away?

105
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,587
Don't run away!

106
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:40,924
Shut up.

107
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,717
Sorry for the commotion.

108
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:43,927
They're acting!

109
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,928
We're filming a TV drama!

110
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,722
They're so passionate.

111
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:48,932
They're just stupid.

112
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,309
You can punch me if you want.

113
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,185
I'm used to it.

114
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,187
Go ahead and do it.

115
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,440
Then I'll be able to hate you.

116
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,193
You'd just be the same as them.

117
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,205
Want some water?

118
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,207
It's over again.

119
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,959
It's the beginning.

120
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,962
Thank you all.

121
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,714
I'll text you tomorrow.

122
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,468
We're finally freed from this tension.

123
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,184
Hey!

124
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,644
What?

125
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,938
What's with that guitar?

126
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,190
It was given to me as I was leaving.

127
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,942
What?

128
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,444
Is there a problem?

129
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,198
Mine gave Nina
one of her guitars she wasn't using.

130
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,702
She said her voice wasn't
unpleasantly seeking attention.

131
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,705
That she was like you, Momoka,
and wished her luck.

132
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,541
Thanks.

133
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:01,338
I told the car owner that you would
be the one dropping it off.

134
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,255
Sure, no worries.

135
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,801
Then maybe I'll get off here too.

136
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,094
I can take you.

137
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,681
I know going downtown is a pain.

138
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,099
The trains are still running.

139
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,978
Don't forget to take
motion sickness medicine next time.

140
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,605
Don't talk to me.

141
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:22,025
- See you later.
- Drive safe!

142
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,570
Are the trains really still running?

143
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:26,863
Nope.

144
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,532
I figured we should talk.

145
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,701
I was being considerate.

146
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:37,415
This kind of house is really relaxing.

147
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,750
Maybe I'll move here.

148
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,752
Do you want to when a room opens?

149
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:45,006
Wait, if you're going to be my roommate,
I may need to reconsider.

150
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,424
That's cold.

151
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:52,013
Did Rupa and Tomo know
Nina would say that?

152
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,056
No way.

153
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:58,186
But I bet they saw it coming
from the way she's been acting.

154
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,106
You're the only one who didn't notice.

155
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,317
Why didn't you stop her?

156
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,902
She's free to do as she wants.

157
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:10,657
You know just how reckless
what she said was.

158
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,536
We haven't even made our indie debut.

159
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,038
We got accepted to that festival.

160
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:22,127
And a label contacted Rupa
expressing interest.

161
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,044
What?

162
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,797
You may think it's crazy,

163
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:29,801
but you're a former Diamond Dust member.

164
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:35,306
Rupa and Tomo are a mystery duo
that got a lot of attention online.

165
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:40,937
And some vocalist tweeted
how much they liked Nina's voice.

166
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,772
That went semi-viral.

167
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:43,940
Really?

168
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,526
We have this many followers now.

169
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,737
The survey for our next performance said

170
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,699
we have the most fans
that are specifically coming for us.

171
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,451
I see.

172
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,537
Nina's not talking about some pipe dream.

173
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,415
I mean, beating Diamond Dust is crazy,

174
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:03,460
but we can at least take the first step.

175
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,962
What's Rupa and Tomo saying?

176
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,798
They were always looking to go pro.

177
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,258
What about you?

178
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,093
I'll do whatever.

179
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,679
What I'm saying is that
we won't be kids forever.

180
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,058
The rest is up to you.

181
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:23,104
So basically,
everyone was already in agreement.

182
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,398
Not exactly.

183
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,859
But Nina is always saying

184
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:31,780
that we need to set a goal
and corner ourselves.

185
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:36,493
Because it's hard, it's important
to not have any escape routes!

186
00:09:39,953 --> 00:09:42,499
Hmm... This one?

187
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,417
Hmm...

188
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:45,502
And this?

189
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,254
Hmm, I guess that should be good?

190
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,883
A minor.

191
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,177
F.

192
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,679
G.

193
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,475
How do they do this?

194
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:01,518
Let's see...

195
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:08,024
Freedom, freedom, I'm free starting today!

196
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:12,946
I'll do whatever I want
Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow!

197
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:13,988
Tada!

198
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,659
Dear Dad,

199
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,160
Thank you for raising me.

200
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,164
I'll try to make it on my own now.

201
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,542
You don't need to send me money anymore.

202
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,461
I'm returning your bankbook too.

203
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:29,921
From Nina.

204
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,923
MUNEO ISERI

205
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,389
Hey, welcome!

206
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:40,640
We're not a sushi place.

207
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,392
Was that wrong?

208
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,394
Just say hello.

209
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,145
You've been here before.

210
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,107
I never pay attention
to this type of thing

211
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,401
when I'm the customer.

212
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:52,902
Gulp.

213
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,779
You eat it, you're fired.

214
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:55,905
Really?

215
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,407
Obviously!

216
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,702
Why did you even apply
to work here anyway?!

217
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,871
It's my first job ever,

218
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,956
so I figured I'd do it with friends.

219
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,416
You're so slow!

220
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,918
We asked for the check ages ago.

221
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,295
I'm sorry.

222
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,797
Where are you from?

223
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,800
You foreigners should know your place.

224
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,093
Excuse me!

225
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:18,720
My apologies.

226
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,096
Just watch it.

227
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,765
Thank you very much.

228
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:24,851
Rupa.

229
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,812
This happens all the time.

230
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,235
It means that I need rock and roll too.

231
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,280
I'll check the inventory.

232
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,242
So what's up with you and Momoka?

233
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,785
Nothing.

234
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,081
We'll probably just fight again
if we talked now.

235
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,086
Just so you know, if things stay rocky,
we're going to quit.

236
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:53,963
I know.

237
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,801
Hey, welcome...

238
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,346
One medium bowl.

239
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:02,764
Hello!

240
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,682
One medium bowl!

241
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,481
You don't need a beer?

242
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:12,815
Nina.

243
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,859
Would you like to order?

244
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,778
You free after this?

245
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,240
I... am.

246
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,326
Girls Band Cry.

247
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,623
So can we agree that there was
no intention of bullying or harm?

248
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,708
A simple argument
got a little out of hand.

249
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,087
Is that the understanding here?

250
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,256
That's good.

251
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,717
We'll have both girls write an apology

252
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:43,721
and seal it with a handshake.

253
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,269
Ms. Iseri?

254
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:56,985
Where are we going?

255
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,488
Somewhere close, we'll be there soon.

256
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:02,699
I see.

257
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,701
Did you want to go somewhere?

258
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:05,994
No.

259
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,123
I don't hate driving with you
in the Kei truck.

260
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:19,756
Honestly.

261
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:24,261
The least they could do is send us
a message, especially when we're waiting.

262
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,763
It'll be okay.

263
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,518
They say the opposite of like
is indifference.

264
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:34,772
They still want to talk alone
after all that fighting.

265
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,649
It proves they care.

266
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,153
They're just stupid.

267
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,283
Is this the place?

268
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,160
Just open the door.

269
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,341
Diamond Dust.

270
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:07,054
This is what it means
to not set escape routes and survive.

271
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:11,184
We can't afford to just play
the songs we like.

272
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,809
In order to survive,

273
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:17,815
we'll have no choice but chase
what will sell, what will be liked,

274
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,234
and what will go viral.

275
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,821
Not everything will necessarily
be like that.

276
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,201
Only a handful can survive

277
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,037
doing the things they want to.

278
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:37,460
Even the current Diamond Dust
didn't want to do this from the start.

279
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:42,090
They chose this to survive,
to sell tickets.

280
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:48,846
That doesn't mean your songs
won't reach people.

281
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:55,269
You rejected your song and
quit the band before you even tried.

282
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,356
But they found an audience
as they are now.

283
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,234
What they're doing now is right.

284
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,778
At first, they were all

285
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,864
totally against being an idol band.

286
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,117
That they'd only play their music.

287
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,869
Nobody listened.

288
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:17,375
But the reality was, even if we
were praised, we didn't sell tickets.

289
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,712
Only the most laughable acts
would become hits.

290
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,881
That's how the world is.

291
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:27,510
That truth slowly begins to pressure you.

292
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,513
And then comes the choice.

293
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:35,184
If you choose to reject it,
you can't continue.

294
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,356
They chose to continue.

295
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,359
You can't hold that against them.

296
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,363
But I don't want you
to make the same choice as me.

297
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:53,536
You asked me why I never moved back home
and why I started a new band.

298
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:59,333
When I saw you sing, it reminded me of
myself when I was first starting out.

299
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:03,671
You didn't care about money
or recognition.

300
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,048
You just sang a song you loved.

301
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:10,511
You were the version of myself I loved.

302
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,014
Someone I used to be.

303
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:17,560
That's why I wanted you to continue
singing as yourself.

304
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,271
Bound by nothing,

305
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,940
I wanted to listen by your side.

306
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,943
Thank you very much!

307
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,738
We're Diamond Dust!

308
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,074
Stick around for the next band!

309
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,370
What about my feelings?

310
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,122
Nina.

311
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,625
What about my feelings?!

312
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:42,710
Nina!

313
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:47,131
Nina!

314
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,758
Let go of me!

315
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,514
I'm not your memory.

316
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,518
Don't lock me up inside your memory!

317
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:03,272
Now, shake hands to make up.

318
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,779
Ms. Iseri?

319
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,074
Ms. Iseri!

320
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,784
Stop, Nina!

321
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,496
It's so blank

322
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,330
It's so long

323
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:25,962
Answers are just formalities

324
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,631
Whether my fingers tremble or not...

325
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,678
There are people who decided to live
because of your songs.

326
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,681
Who you need to protect

327
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,975
isn't yourself in your memories.

328
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,728
It's your desire
to have your songs reach people.

329
00:17:43,436 --> 00:17:45,606
You started the band because

330
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,233
you wanted to express

331
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,486
your feelings, your joy, your anger,
your sadness.

332
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:54,240
That's why you sang at your school
and came to Tokyo!

333
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,992
That's why you went professional!

334
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,994
Why are you so scared?

335
00:17:59,494 --> 00:18:00,955
Stop being scared!

336
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,040
There's one in front of you.

337
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:08,254
Someone who was able to fly
because you gave them the courage!

338
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,382
Someone who felt joy being able
to sing with you,

339
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,759
and is willing to bet everything on you!

340
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,012
Someone who believes in you

341
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,471
is right in front of you...

342
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,766
Momoka.

343
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,271
Don't use me to run away.

344
00:18:28,898 --> 00:18:29,734
Momokan?

345
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,028
It's you, right?

346
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,529
Right?

347
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,406
Let's go, Nina.

348
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,157
- What?
- Just come on!

349
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,327
Hina.

350
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,911
- Hey!
- Coming!

351
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,371
I'm leaving!

352
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,332
- You can take the train!
- What?!

353
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,416
Momokan!

354
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,667
Momoka!

355
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,925
Wait, Momoka!

356
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:55,676
Momoka!

357
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,556
You idiot.

358
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:01,682
Are you crazy?!

359
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,560
Now we're even.

360
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,648
Why are you running away?

361
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,693
You don't need to run.

362
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:15,446
You did nothing wrong!

363
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:16,696
Shut up!

364
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,202
Momokan!

365
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,928
You don't have to say anything,
just listen!

366
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,305
We heard you started a band.

367
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,307
We look forward to it.

368
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,976
We don't regret anything.

369
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,479
We're going to make it to the top.

370
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,981
We'll make you admit we weren't wrong.

371
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,984
We're gonna survive until then.

372
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:57,738
We're not going to lose either.

373
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,242
You'll say that we were right.

374
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,372
That we weren't wrong!

375
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,498
What?

376
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,250
Who do you think you are?

377
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:14,171
You've got some nerve saying that
after that crappy performance!

378
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,506
Momokan.

379
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,090
You're an idol band, right?

380
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,719
If you don't have any regrets,
then try being cuter!

381
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,012
Act professional!

382
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,182
We're entering the next festival too.

383
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,393
If you play like crap again there,

384
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,771
we're stealing all your fans!

385
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,276
What's that?

386
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,278
A declaration of war.

387
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,532
Momokan!

388
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:44,034
We won't forget!

389
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,416
Nina, get in.

390
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,922
Do you know her?

391
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:58,924
No.

392
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,926
I don't know her.

393
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,055
Damn it.

394
00:21:05,388 --> 00:21:06,432
Damn it!

395
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,435
What's so funny?

396
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:10,895
Momoka.

397
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:11,979
What?

398
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,941
I love you after all.

399
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,068
The hell is that?

400
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,281
Isn't it obvious?

401
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,285
I'm confessing my love.

402
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,980
HOW DID IT GO?

403
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,445
What is it, Rupa?

404
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:04,823
I told you so.

405
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:10,788
Good grief.

406
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,129
They're interesting for sure.

407
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,718
Never influenced by anybody
Never becoming anybody

408
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,721
I laughed, thinking it a dream

409
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,808
Numbed by the weakness I had forgotten

410
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,811
I can't even say that I'm lonely

411
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:39,525
This fragile heart
Vulnerable to even casual conversation

412
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:45,656
Is incapable of making anyone happy

413
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:52,871
But still, I feel a growing hope

414
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:58,836
Moving past all of the lies

415
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:02,256
I just want to hear
That I'm not wrong

416
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,384
I'm a dreamer, I'm young

417
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:09,013
I don't care if I'm still the same today

418
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,599
I just want to sing with you

419
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,977
My emotions stir so often

420
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:18,147
I've been hated

421
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,483
But I'm going to keep walking

422
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:27,698
Proud of myself
Who can never become anybody

423
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,868
Even if I'm alone

424
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,330
I believe in myself

425
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:41,378
Every time I get hurt, I just need to sing

426
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,596
