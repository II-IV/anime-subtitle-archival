1
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:14,973
Nice to meet you!

2
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,265
We are...

3
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,810
Diamond Dust.

4
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,646
Our debut single--

5
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:24,650
We're wasting time.

6
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,151
This place isn't free.

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,737
We should look for
a bass player after all.

8
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,031
If we can find one.

9
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:34,701
But I think the three of us
sound pretty good as we are.

10
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:38,789
What is it?

11
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,290
It's just...
Who's the girl that was just talking?

12
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,211
No idea, D-D's new vocalist, right?

13
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,796
Not that I've ever met her.

14
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:47,673
What about her?

15
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,800
It can't be.

16
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,511
No, it's nothing.

17
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:59,059
This unfinished beat covers the night

18
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,937
Embracing us before we're crushed

19
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:06,650
Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand

20
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,486
There will be change
If you just reach out

21
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:19,246
Crying in a crowd with a voiceless voice

22
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:23,500
Come morning
The footsteps drown out the voice

23
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:27,629
No matter how much time passes
It never dries

24
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:32,217
The cold, muddy waters of a decaying city

25
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,719
In a world where nothing changes

26
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,555
We have to live through it

27
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,850
It may be dumb, but we have no choice

28
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,603
We've already started walking

29
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,772
It may seem unreal
It may seem stupid

30
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:48,567
This hopeless city of ours

31
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,861
But I still saw it with my own eyes

32
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,739
I touched it with these hands
See? See?

33
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:57,034
See? There it goes again
It's so stupid

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,870
Shine a light through
The hopeless darkness

35
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,039
This isn't a dream
Even in a dead city

36
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,042
Giving up won't change anything
Even now, now

37
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,587
Now, this unfinished beat covers the night

38
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:11,423
Embracing us before we're crushed

39
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,178
Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand

40
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:18,847
There will be change
If you just reach out

41
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,648
RISING VOCALS

42
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:28,732
Yo.

43
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,985
Hey, Momo! How many years has it been?

44
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,363
Not more than two, I think.

45
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,116
This place sure hasn't changed.

46
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,913
Yes, it has! We're about to go under.
Maybe even tomorrow!

47
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,456
You're my only hope.

48
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,167
Is that Momoka?

49
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,211
Wow, so cute!

50
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,421
Shut up.

51
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,591
She only looks like her, right?

52
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:55,925
Nina.

53
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:56,927
Y-Yes?

54
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,429
He said we can look inside.

55
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,599
- Excuse us.
- Excuse us.

56
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:14,736
It's a bit smaller than
the stage we played on before.

57
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,656
So this is how much room I'll have.

58
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,157
It's like this at most live houses.

59
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,412
But this place
has been around for a while,

60
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,455
so there are a lot of regulars.

61
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:28,208
They'll be ruthless if you suck.

62
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,127
He said he wanted us to play a show here.

63
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,212
What do you think?

64
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,214
A live show...

65
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,217
We don't have to if you're not feeling it.

66
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,095
- We'll need to practice--
- Let's do it.

67
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,180
At least think about it a little.

68
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,141
You're totally hooked now.

69
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,601
You were so reluctant before.

70
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:50,230
Well, we have about 20 minutes
for our set.

71
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,150
It won't be that bad.

72
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,235
Let's try it.

73
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,238
Here are your tickets.

74
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:02,325
Also, don't mention that I'm a former
Diamond Dust member in the promos.

75
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:06,204
I'm forming a new band
with these two after all.

76
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,169
Here.

77
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,629
There's no running away now.

78
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:15,672
What?

79
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,633
THE NEXT DAY

80
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:22,637
I didn't expect that we'd have to
sell them ourselves.

81
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,098
Have you sold any?

82
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,434
Of course not!

83
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,769
I only have two left.

84
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,729
No way!

85
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,898
Ask around at your cram school.

86
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,650
It's not like
they'll hear about it back home.

87
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,040
What?

88
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,918
My band is playing a show...

89
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,795
Would you be interested?

90
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:56,546
You're playing?

91
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:57,798
Yes.

92
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,050
I'm more of a fan of heavy metal.

93
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:03,053
Oh, I think you'll like our music then.

94
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,308
And you just gave it to her for free?

95
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,519
We need to get an audience before profits.

96
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,313
And it's not like we're in it
for the money to begin with.

97
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,399
Isn't it more important
that a lot of people show up?

98
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:17,442
They won't come.

99
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:23,281
Look, people generally don't want to waste
anything they spend money on,

100
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,535
but they're totally fine
with wasting something that's free.

101
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:31,498
Besides, we eat the cost
of any ticket we give away for free.

102
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,626
Do you really not know anything?

103
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:35,752
What do you mean?

104
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,508
We paid the live house
our own money for these tickets.

105
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,009
What?!

106
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,136
One medium beef bowl.

107
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,931
This kind of
ticket-quota concept is dying out,

108
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,309
but live houses generally
get paid upfront by the bands

109
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,854
as a participation fee
or to cover tickets.

110
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:59,901
That way, even if nobody shows up,
the venue is guaranteed a minimum income.

111
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,903
That's unfair!

112
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,904
That's the business!

113
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,950
These rice grains...

114
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:11,121
Huh?

115
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,166
Here.

116
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,003
Sorry to interrupt your break.

117
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,588
What?

118
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:25,051
Momoka should've told us that
she was putting up her own money.

119
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,722
Well, from her point of view,
we're just kids.

120
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:29,681
Why?

121
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:34,311
Well, we're younger and
it's not like we're out here with jobs.

122
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,314
Oh?

123
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,565
You were with Momo!

124
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:40,609
Hello!

125
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,529
What's that?

126
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,575
Where did I put it?

127
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,244
Is he going to add more tickets
we have to pay for?

128
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,245
I doubt it.

129
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,330
Found it!

130
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,332
Here you go.

131
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:56,666
What is it?

132
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,587
You know how Diamond Dust
is making their major debut?

133
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,839
They came by around noon
to thank me for my support in the past

134
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,842
and said I should go see them.

135
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,344
You're giving these to us?

136
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:13,224
I kind of lose interest when they get
such a major label backing them.

137
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:18,980
Why did Momoka quit Diamond Dust?

138
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,273
She didn't say?

139
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,232
No.

140
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,360
I don't know the details,

141
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:28,740
but there were rumors that they were told
to be more mainstream before they debuted.

142
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,077
Momo was the only one against it.

143
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,497
Could you give a ticket to Momo, too?

144
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,416
So, should we give one to Momoka?

145
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,795
I feel like we'd just
get into an argument.

146
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,132
But... I want to see them.

147
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,386
Then, want to go together?

148
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,721
I'm getting curious too.

149
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:53,974
Subaru...

150
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,737
You're the one who gave me
the live show ticket, right?

151
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:08,697
Yes.

152
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:13,326
I have three friends who want to go.
Do you have more tickets?

153
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,870
It's 7,500 yen for three tickets.

154
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,206
Oh, you're charging money?

155
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,251
You don't have to buy them
if you don't want to.

156
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,587
You're too extreme.

157
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,339
Then what was I supposed to do?

158
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:31,344
"Oh! Last week, we were allowed to
give them away for free,

159
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,139
but from this week,
I have to start charging people."

160
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:36,015
"But how about this?"

161
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,601
"I can give them to you for 2,500 yen
instead of 3,000!"

162
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,519
Liar.

163
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,477
It's hard work.

164
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,232
Okay, queue numbers 500 to 550!

165
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:49,738
What is it?

166
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,083
They sold out the venue as expected.

167
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:27,442
I'm currently at a crossroads
You won't find on any map

168
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:34,783
What should I use to guide me?

169
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,674
It's your own fault.

170
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,768
- No way... It can't be.
- How would you move forward?

171
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,979
It's so blank
It's so long

172
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:10,193
The answers tend to be superficial clichés

173
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,655
- You don't get to sing this.
- Whether my fingers tremble or not

174
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,449
- What? Hey!
- There's no right answer

175
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,703
Hold on. What's wrong?
It hasn't even been five minutes!

176
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,788
Subaru.

177
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:22,747
What?

178
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:27,919
Give me a minute, I just feel like
saying some really nasty words right now.

179
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,965
I'll shout out some meaningless words
to let off some steam.

180
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:32,715
Huh?

181
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,099
...die, you piece of crap!

182
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,601
Some of the words at the end
were comprehensible.

183
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,688
What the hell? What the hell?!

184
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,481
- What the hell?!
- I don't know.

185
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,067
It had to be Diamond Dust?

186
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,736
Something I care about
just as much as my life.

187
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,780
My treasure...

188
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,657
So what's the problem?

189
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,996
Their new vocalist...

190
00:11:03,453 --> 00:11:05,164
I know her.

191
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,586
She used to be my friend,
before I cut contact.

192
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,629
She's dead to me!

193
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,467
Girls Band Cry.

194
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:20,972
Nice to meet you!

195
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,348
We are...

196
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,684
Diamond Dust!

197
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,188
You'll break it.

198
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,607
I don't want to hear them.

199
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,193
You decided to go to their show,
got bent out of shape,

200
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,904
and now you're whining.

201
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,030
You know what that's called?

202
00:11:38,655 --> 00:11:40,241
Annoying.

203
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,660
You wouldn't know how I feel.

204
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,412
I wouldn't even want to.

205
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,414
What kind of coincidence is this?!

206
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:47,957
Like some bad miracle!

207
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,002
Why is she the vocalist for Diamond Dust?

208
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,588
Not to mention how superficial she is!

209
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:58,301
But she actually went to many auditions
and ended up doing well, right?

210
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,803
- But still!
- Shut up!

211
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,804
That's your problem.

212
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,559
You're right, but I've listened to
and loved Diamond Dust

213
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,188
way more than anyone at that show!

214
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,315
That's what's annoying.

215
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,943
D-D doesn't belong to just you.

216
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,196
Then you're fine with this?

217
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,739
Seems fine to me.

218
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,325
They're more popular than
when I was in the band.

219
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,993
Is that all that matters?

220
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,870
It's better than not being popular.

221
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,789
You're not answering the question!

222
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,336
You're really butting into
other people's business.

223
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:37,381
I told you,
it's a waste of money to argue here.

224
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,424
Subaru.

225
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,634
It's no use.

226
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,721
There's no way we can practice like this.

227
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,349
If you're gonna fight,
make sure to settle it first.

228
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,229
TORITEI
PUB

229
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,691
- So?
- Hold on.

230
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,735
So unnecessary...

231
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:01,239
And by the way, why did we come to a pub
when you're wearing that?

232
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:05,284
It shouldn't be a problem
as long as I don't drink.

233
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,746
Why are you always in
your school uniform, anyway?

234
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,165
I don't have to figure out what to wear

235
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:15,461
and there are other benefits
when you're a high school girl.

236
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,171
Liar.

237
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,881
Anyway, enough about me. Now go.

238
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,261
Why do you defend them?

239
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,388
I'm not defending them.

240
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,182
Yes, you are. Think about it.

241
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:32,812
The current Diamond Dust isn't
the same as the one with you in it.

242
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:33,771
So?

243
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,524
I'm saying that it's weird
you're backing them up.

244
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,109
It's not weird!

245
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:41,237
I'm not in their band anymore,
so they're free to do whatever.

246
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:44,782
It's not my place
to criticize their decisions.

247
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,201
That's not what I'm saying.

248
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,453
I'm asking you if you like it or not.

249
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:50,913
It's whatever.

250
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,041
I don't like it or hate it.

251
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,377
It's the band you were in.

252
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,881
It's the band
that you poured your soul into.

253
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,009
Don't decide that on your own.

254
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,470
I guess I was wrong then.

255
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:10,641
I guess you never cared about Diamond Dust
and never poured your soul into it.

256
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:11,934
Shut up.

257
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,812
It's who the vocalist is
that bothers you, right?

258
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:15,938
No!

259
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,942
I just want to know if you're fine with
what Diamond Dust has become!

260
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,906
Please pay no attention to us!

261
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,325
Calm down, both of you.

262
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:33,247
Listen, just like people,
bands grow and change.

263
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,500
For all things, change is inevitable.

264
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,211
Then why did you quit?

265
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,799
You quit because
you couldn't accept that change, right?

266
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:47,011
You quit because it wouldn't be
the Diamond Dust you knew.

267
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,140
You quit because you thought
you weren't wrong.

268
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:55,103
You quit because you hate
the kind of stuff they're doing now.

269
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,772
Why won't you say anything?!

270
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:00,191
Does the song I heard back then
mean nothing?!

271
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,568
Isn't that the kind of thing
D-D wanted to do?

272
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,446
Just admit that they're different.

273
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,449
What they are now isn't Diamond Dust!

274
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,326
They're just--

275
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,703
Oh, geez...

276
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,706
Shut up.

277
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,417
No.

278
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:22,255
I just love the Diamond Dust
that you were a part of.

279
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:34,183
It's so blank
It's so long

280
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,619
The answers tend to be superficial clichés

281
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:39,897
I just love the Diamond Dust
that you were a part of.

282
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,220
That song changed my life.

283
00:15:43,286 --> 00:15:44,252
Whether my fingers tremble or not

284
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,362
That's why I don't want you to lose.

285
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,201
I know you're not satisfied,

286
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,745
but you still say,
"I'm in the wrong. They're right."

287
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,248
I don't want to see you lie to yourself!

288
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:03,337
Do you know what
Diamond Dust's goal was back then?

289
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,756
What?

290
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:10,678
To keep the original band members
until we were all old ladies.

291
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,014
To never quit.

292
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,183
It wasn't about music or direction.

293
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,101
We only cared about that one thing.

294
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,938
That's why it's all my fault.

295
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,067
"Just be patient."

296
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,655
"One day, we'll be able to do
what we want to do."

297
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,202
They desperately tried to convince me.

298
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,998
But I still quit. I did.

299
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,296
Here. More oolong tea.

300
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,173
Thank you.

301
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,050
Nina.

302
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,887
I'm sorry for the commotion, folks!

303
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:57,934
Still...

304
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,562
I still like you.

305
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,940
Because I like your music.

306
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:09,737
Because the one who moved me
was the Diamond Dust from back then.

307
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,073
Because it was you.

308
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:18,871
You're so stupid.

309
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:20,705
You're dripping snot.

310
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:22,875
Yes, I am stupid.

311
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:27,505
I wouldn't be doing this here
if I weren't stupid.

312
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,759
More alcohol, please!

313
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,844
- Subaru...
- Hm?

314
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,265
What? Wait, no...

315
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:45,022
I'm sorry, looking at your face
just ticked me off.

316
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,986
I thought you could hold your liquor.

317
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,363
She did drink a lot today.

318
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,739
She reeks of booze.

319
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:57,368
You're dragging her!

320
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,369
- Get her legs!
- Roger!

321
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,167
How's this?

322
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,128
This feels weird...

323
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,381
We're going to put you down for a second.

324
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,383
I'm sorry.

325
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:18,973
I'm sorry.

326
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,643
Maybe she was happy.

327
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,311
No.

328
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,398
No.

329
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,744
You should pick our stage outfits.

330
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,911
What?

331
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,372
Having someone you have a history with

332
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:48,377
take over as the vocalist for
your favorite band is a rare experience.

333
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,297
Better make use of it
and not let it go to waste.

334
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,715
Make use of it?

335
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,678
Putting all your anger,
joy, and sadness into it

336
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,430
is what makes bands great.

337
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:00,638
What?

338
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,725
The promo page for our upcoming show.

339
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:07,355
"Featuring former
Diamond Dust member Momoka!"

340
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,440
That jerk!

341
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,403
But this means some of the people
who went to see that Diamond Dust show

342
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,113
will definitely check us out.

343
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,826
So think about what you want to show them.

344
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:22,953
You're right.

345
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:25,455
Outfits...

346
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,167
But we can't spend much money on them.

347
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,463
It's been three years.

348
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:38,552
We were talking about how we need
to leave a mark at the next competition.

349
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,478
Momo!

350
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:48,521
Yo.

351
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,523
Sorry!

352
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:55,111
I told them not to,
but the staff just wrote that about you.

353
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,946
Though thankfully, we sold out the show!

354
00:19:58,823 --> 00:19:59,573
What?

355
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,038
So, what about our outfits?

356
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,333
I thought these might work.

357
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:11,836
Here!

358
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,921
What? You guys prepared these?

359
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,048
Let us know if you don't like it.

360
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,175
You'll still have to wear it though.

361
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,428
I want you to bare it all with us.

362
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:23,388
I see.

363
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,349
I like it.

364
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,811
You're Momoka?

365
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,271
Yeah.

366
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:34,692
No offense, but I don't vibe
with girl bands.

367
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,694
Mind if I go tear it up?

368
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,654
We're not really a...

369
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:41,949
No need to worry,
we'll tear it up on our own.

370
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:45,578
Whatever.

371
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,873
Nice one.

372
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,338
18:25 SHINKAWASAKI (PLACEHOLDER)

373
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,007
Momo!

374
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,340
Momoka!

375
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,679
Momoka! I love you!

376
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,894
Wanna just start?

377
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:13,522
Don't you think "leaving a mark"
is a nice concept?

378
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,692
Frantically struggling
and flailing around...

379
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:21,614
We'll hurt ourselves in the process,
but also our adversaries.

380
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,449
Maybe.

381
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,869
Your song ripped my heart out.

382
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:29,705
It left a mark on me.

383
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,957
And told me not to lose, no matter what.

384
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,796
Let's go leave our mark!

385
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,135
Shout what you feel.

386
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,513
Don't speak and
just shout what's in your heart.

387
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,724
Your dissatisfaction, anger, sadness,
shame, embarrassment,

388
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,851
past events that make you want to scream,

389
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,604
and all the regrets that
make you sweat to just think about...

390
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,606
Just bare it all!

391
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,401
Let's go!

392
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,903
LIAR

393
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,404
WITHDREW

394
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,907
I'm gonna bare it all!

395
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,794
What did we find
At the constantly flowing intersection?

396
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:20,047
Hollow words, shaving each other down

397
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:23,092
A fallen shooting star
Would blow it all away

398
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:26,303
Well, we couldn't change anything at all

399
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,348
We pretend not to know
So our hands stay clean

400
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,226
In the corner of our eyes
Our dreams crumble to pieces

401
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:33,727
We pretend not to notice

402
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,311
We pretend not to hear

403
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,691
Look, it's passing us by

404
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,734
The city flows down a whirlpool of truth

405
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:45,196
Where should we float to?

406
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,867
If we can smile when we arrive

407
00:22:48,032 --> 00:22:50,411
Then let's hold hands

408
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:51,453
It's not a dream

409
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:54,415
We finally notice
After they've turned to ashes

410
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:57,710
Our wishes never reach

411
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,337
In this ever-changing world

412
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:04,883
What should we come up with?

413
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,681
What should we raise?

414
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,979
Will I be able to meet you?

415
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,777
Before everything ends

416
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,825
With our own hands

417
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:38,667
Let's draw it out

418
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,012
