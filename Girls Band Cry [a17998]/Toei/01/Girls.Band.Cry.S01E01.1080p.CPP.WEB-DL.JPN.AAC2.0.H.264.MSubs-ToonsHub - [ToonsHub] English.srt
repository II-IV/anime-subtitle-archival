1
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,889
Thank you for riding with us.

2
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:15,891
Passengers changing to
the Chuo Line, Yamanote Line,

3
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:21,563
Keihin-Tohoku Line, Tokaido Line,
Joban Line, Sobu Line, Keio Line,

4
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,735
or the Tohoku, Hokuriku, and Joetsu
Shinkansen Lines. Please transfer here.

5
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:34,493
This train will be
turning back at 17:54 as...

6
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,170
Miss?

7
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,714
Miss!

8
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,512
Good morning. You've reached Tokyo.

9
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,056
Thank you.

10
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,814
I had to get off at Shinagawa
and take the blue line...

11
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,691
but I came all the way to Tokyo.

12
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:10,696
Um, blue...

13
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,408
Well, there's light blue and indigo.

14
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:25,961
Bound for Kamata and Kannai...

15
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:30,549
Get your grilled eel bento,
katsu sandwich, and katsu curry here!

16
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,634
Grilled eel, katsu sandwich...

17
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,345
Grilled eel, katsu sandwich,
and katsu curry...

18
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,055
Grilled eel, katsu sandwich...

19
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,183
Grilled eel, katsu sandwich,
and katsu curry...

20
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,978
Whoa.

21
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,317
Um...

22
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,029
Yokohama...

23
00:01:56,658 --> 00:02:01,496
In March, at the age of 17,
I moved to Tokyo.

24
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,790
Because I hate to lose.

25
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,334
Because I wasn't wrong.

26
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,591
Snow!

27
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:24,019
This unfinished beat covers the night

28
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,897
Embracing us before we're crushed

29
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:31,610
Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand

30
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,446
There will be change
If you just reach out

31
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:44,206
Crying in a crowd with a voiceless voice

32
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:48,460
Come morning
The footsteps drown out the voice

33
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:52,589
No matter how much time passes
It never dries

34
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:57,177
The cold, muddy waters of a decaying city

35
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,679
In a world where nothing changes

36
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,514
We have to live through it

37
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,810
It may be dumb, but we have no choice

38
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,562
We've already started walking

39
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,732
It may seem unreal
It may seem stupid

40
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,526
This hopeless city of ours

41
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,821
But I still saw it with my own eyes

42
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,698
I touched it with these hands
See? See?

43
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,993
See? There it goes again
It's so stupid

44
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,830
Shine a light through
The hopeless darkness

45
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,998
This isn't a dream
Even in a dead city

46
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:30,043
Giving up won't change anything
Even now, now

47
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,547
Now, this unfinished beat covers the night

48
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,383
Embracing us before we're crushed

49
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:41,138
Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand

50
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,807
There will be change
If you just reach out

51
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,943
TOKYO HEAVE-HO

52
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,737
Excuse me.

53
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,822
Excuse me!

54
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:02,117
It's Iseri. I'm here to pick up my key.

55
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,121
That figures.
I mean, I got here pretty late.

56
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,123
Still dead.

57
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,628
Um...

58
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:17,632
Is this it?

59
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,389
Excuse me, is this...

60
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,738
Keep it down!

61
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,032
I'm sorry!

62
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,038
This is it.

63
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,710
Yeah, I figured.

64
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:02,511
These places usually have...

65
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,346
No?

66
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,472
Excuse me.

67
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,431
Ow!

68
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,560
I live next door. Can I help you?

69
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,899
Um... My name is Iseri. I just moved here.

70
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,485
Oh, is that right? Nice to meet you.

71
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,569
Likewise.

72
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,072
It's just that I don't have the key.

73
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,325
I was supposed to get it
from the real estate agent today,

74
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,910
but I showed up too late.

75
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,077
Did you call?

76
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,248
My phone battery died...

77
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,290
Want to use mine?

78
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,544
The phone number is saved on my phone.

79
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,797
Then why don't you recharge it
at our place?

80
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,300
It's okay, we don't mind at all.

81
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:48,390
No, thank you. I'm sure it'll work out.

82
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:49,891
Thank you for the offer.

83
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,520
Excuse me! I'll just leave my bag there!

84
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:58,440
Yes, finally!

85
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,442
9 MESSAGES FROM SUZUNE

86
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,694
That figures.

87
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:01,945
SUZUNE
CALLING

88
00:06:04,154 --> 00:06:04,948
Hello.

89
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,700
You finally answered.

90
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,202
Mom! Nina answered her phone!

91
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,288
Sorry, my battery died earlier.

92
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,415
What are you doing?

93
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,791
The man called us.

94
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,711
He said you never showed up.

95
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,713
I know.

96
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,755
I'll go tomorrow.

97
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,258
Enough. Leave her be.

98
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,217
Bye.

99
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,470
Do you really think
you can make it over there?

100
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,306
Sorry, my battery's low.

101
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,363
AROUND HERE
I'LL BE PLAYING HERE

102
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,366
That's close by.

103
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,327
"22:00"?

104
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,371
No way!

105
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,483
It's so blank
It's so long

106
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:27,072
The answers tend to be superficial clichés

107
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:32,410
Whether my fingers tremble or not

108
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:36,164
There's no right answer
There's no losing

109
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,959
-I've been me all my life
-She's actually here.

110
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,087
That's all there is

111
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:49,594
No matter how much I fight
There's no tomorrow

112
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,347
Excuse me.

113
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,974
Excuse me!

114
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,895
You're Momoka Kawaragi, aren't you?

115
00:07:59,062 --> 00:07:59,854
Yes.

116
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:05,151
I'm a big fan of yours and Diamond Dust.

117
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:06,861
Thanks.

118
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:11,199
I really love your songs.

119
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,952
I just moved to Tokyo
from the countryside today

120
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,371
with the help of your music.

121
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:17,789
That right?

122
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,041
It's true! Really.

123
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,712
I've probably listened to it
a thousand times.

124
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:28,383
I saw on social media
that you were playing here tonight.

125
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,968
It felt like fate.

126
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,636
Then would you buy a CD?

127
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,931
Yes, of course!

128
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,392
A thousand yen.

129
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,477
Here.

130
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,522
Thanks.

131
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,276
That's not a thousand yen.

132
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,363
You're so straight-laced.

133
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,242
Did I say something weird?

134
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,785
No.

135
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,665
I'm just kind of happy
to have a fan like you.

136
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,294
Hey.

137
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:12,177
Like I said last time, this is our spot.

138
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,429
What? Then write your name down.

139
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,183
Go play somewhere else.

140
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,063
Let's go.

141
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,981
O-Okay.

142
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:25,940
Hey!

143
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,739
Get back here!

144
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:33,990
Run!

145
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,201
You're dead!

146
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,746
Why am I running too?

147
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,289
That's a good point.

148
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,751
Maybe if you tell them
that you don't really know me,

149
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:45,919
they might forgive...

150
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,170
Get back here!

151
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,463
Yeah, never mind.

152
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,048
This way!

153
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,467
Damn it!

154
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,559
Idiots.

155
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,562
What does that mean?

156
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,356
It means thank you.

157
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,192
Then why were they so mad?

158
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,070
What's your name?

159
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,322
Nina.

160
00:10:15,155 --> 00:10:16,241
Nina Iseri.

161
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,953
Kawasaki and Shin-Kawasaki?

162
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,249
Wouldn't you expect
Kawasaki to come after Shin-Kawasaki?

163
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,500
But it wasn't.

164
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,335
You could've just looked it up.

165
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,337
My phone died.

166
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,589
So that's why you're locked out.

167
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:36,386
My uncle told me that Kawasaki would be
a good place to live in Tokyo.

168
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:37,636
What a lie!

169
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:38,596
Tokyo?

170
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:39,597
What?

171
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,724
Kawasaki isn't in Tokyo.

172
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,019
It's actually in Kanagawa Prefecture.
Just like Yokohama.

173
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,689
What? He said
it was on the edge of Tokyo...

174
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,817
You got tricked by your uncle
and real estate agent.

175
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,111
I bet they gave you an unpopular room.

176
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,864
That's why rent was so cheap...

177
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,616
Although, I actually love Kawasaki.

178
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:02,162
Yes, I mean,
I got the chance to meet you after all.

179
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:07,667
I always carry the ticket for the canceled
Diamond Dust concert in my hometown.

180
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,295
Would you autograph it?

181
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,588
Wow.

182
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,131
Here you go.

183
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,133
One medium beef bowl.

184
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,636
So this is a beef bowl!

185
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:22,265
Is this your first?
What planet are you from?

186
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,391
Kumamoto.

187
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,184
They don't have this chain?

188
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,144
We do!

189
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:30,648
But my family always eats at home.

190
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,902
What are you, some rich girl?

191
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,904
No, it's not like that.

192
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:41,326
Yummy! What is this?

193
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,577
Is it that good?

194
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:43,535
Yes!

195
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,956
That was delicious.

196
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,919
It's almost time for the last train.

197
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,712
What's your plan?

198
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,130
I'll make do.

199
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:55,924
How?

200
00:11:58,968 --> 00:11:59,928
Come on.

201
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,264
Thanks. I'll leave money here
for the both of us.

202
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,475
Thank you!

203
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,437
I take care of my fans.

204
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,524
It was very delicious!

205
00:12:14,107 --> 00:12:15,485
Thank you very much!

206
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,779
You wanna fight?

207
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,697
Thank you!

208
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,493
You said it meant thank you!

209
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,410
It's the complete opposite!

210
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,453
My bad.

211
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,498
Is this it?

212
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,500
Be prepared, it's cold.

213
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,585
The heat doesn't work.

214
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,045
Do you live with family?

215
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,089
No.

216
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,010
Go on in, it takes forever
to get these off.

217
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,220
The room up ahead.

218
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,929
Excuse me.

219
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,648
The light's on the left.

220
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,407
You okay with cats?

221
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,828
Have a seat. I'll pour you some coffee.

222
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,162
Thank you.

223
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,374
So cool.

224
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,708
Do you play?

225
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,878
Not at all, but I wish I could.

226
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,714
Want to hold it?

227
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,881
Can I?

228
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,135
Go on.

229
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,388
Wow! It's heavier than I imagined.

230
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,140
It doesn't suit you.

231
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,142
That figures.

232
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,727
I'm kidding!

233
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,896
Anybody can learn
to look good holding a guitar.

234
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,024
You're still in high school?

235
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,067
Yes. I'm 17.

236
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,321
I'd be in my third year
if I was still in high school.

237
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:44,824
Do you want sugar?

238
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,159
Yes, please.

239
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:52,415
I also dropped out and moved here
with a friend when I turned 17.

240
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,542
It's already been three years...

241
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,211
So you're still 20?

242
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,672
I don't know why, but that stings.

243
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,592
But maybe this really is fate.

244
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,260
Yes, it's fate!

245
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:05,678
Um...

246
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,929
You just got here today, right?

247
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,183
Yes. If you'd like to exchange...

248
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,436
I'm going back to Asahikawa tomorrow.

249
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,522
Girls Band Cry.

250
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:18,941
Going back?

251
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,694
I'm leaving this place.

252
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,697
I'm heading back home and quitting music.

253
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:29,744
Why? Your songs are so amazing.

254
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:31,829
Thanks.

255
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:32,830
It'll get cold.

256
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,583
Momoka.

257
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,795
I don't have a choice.
Not everyone can make it big.

258
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:42,048
It's hard living off my music earnings.

259
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,342
I spend all my time at my part-time job.

260
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:49,472
But you made this song
and it's gotten so many views.

261
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,768
I gave it away.

262
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:57,230
I don't have the rights to that song.

263
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,400
Details!

264
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,152
Please.

265
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,737
You don't need the details.

266
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:05,780
Please!

267
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:08,366
I mean, you're the one who made it!

268
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,743
You couldn't have just given it away!

269
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,828
You can.

270
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,079
You can't!

271
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,749
- You can!
- You can't!

272
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,961
You're stubborn. A stubborn Kumamoto girl.

273
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,212
You got that right.

274
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:24,882
Please stop that.

275
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:28,761
Don't touch me.

276
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:30,847
Damn it.

277
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,808
What's with you?
You were so timid just minutes ago.

278
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:34,767
You're so weird.

279
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,477
Because that song...

280
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,022
Good evening.

281
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,649
Good evening.

282
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,735
If you make a racket,
the neighbors will complain again.

283
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,071
You're heading out now?

284
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:49,490
Is he...

285
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,616
He's...

286
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,828
Y-Your boyfriend, right?!
You live together?!

287
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,165
Calm down!

288
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,375
He's just a roommate.

289
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,086
You think
I could afford to live here alone?

290
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,130
But he's a man.

291
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,799
Yeah, but he's only interested in men.

292
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,594
He's probably staying over
at his boyfriend's.

293
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,595
Boyfriend?

294
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,684
Tokyo is so different!

295
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:17,643
It's Kawasaki.

296
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,438
We have different rooms and schedules.

297
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,190
We barely even see each other.

298
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,149
But...

299
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,819
You should think about
finding a roommate too.

300
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:31,407
Or else you'll just be spending
all your time working part-time.

301
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:32,575
How much is rent?

302
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:33,910
Fifty thousand.

303
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,244
And work?

304
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,580
I will, but I haven't found one yet.

305
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,832
Are you going to be okay?

306
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:44,295
I have savings, and I got some money
from my family when I left.

307
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,339
Oh, you got it easy then.

308
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,050
Sounds like you'll be fine.

309
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,635
As long as you have money...

310
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,513
What do you know about me?

311
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,560
Don't just assume that I have it easy!

312
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,604
Thank you for the coffee.

313
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:02,730
I should leave.

314
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:15,826
Hold up.

315
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,537
You walk pretty fast.

316
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,584
Look, I'm sorry.

317
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,505
You dropped out of school
and moved here at your age.

318
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,840
Of course it isn't easy.

319
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,051
What's your dream?

320
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,845
I don't really have one.

321
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,097
You don't have one?

322
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:39,392
I didn't come here because of a dream.

323
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,353
I just didn't have anywhere I belonged.

324
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,483
People acted like I was at fault
even though I did nothing wrong.

325
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,359
And I didn't want to lose to that.

326
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,946
I see. Then I need to apologize again.

327
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,366
What happened?

328
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,575
With you.

329
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,078
Why are you moving back to Asahikawa?

330
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,790
It was nothing big.
Just your usual fighting and splitting up.

331
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,127
You mean Diamond Dust?

332
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,086
Yeah.

333
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:11,132
When we split up, we talked about
who the song belonged to.

334
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,760
And since they said
they were going to continue music...

335
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,512
You just gave it to them?

336
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:21,642
At the time, I figured
I could just write another good song.

337
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:23,769
What?

338
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,523
So you're just a softie.

339
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,277
But I think that's cool of you.

340
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,864
Hey! That hurts!

341
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,282
Oh, your face is red.

342
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,241
Shut up!

343
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,036
Hey! You're messing up my hair!

344
00:18:44,205 --> 00:18:45,499
Wanna go karaoke?

345
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,042
Now?

346
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,550
You know some old songs.

347
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,552
My grandma likes them.

348
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,555
But you still became
a fan of Diamond Dust.

349
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:03,559
Yes, I listened to you
when I was feeling really stuck

350
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:07,563
and it felt like you were singing about
exactly how I was feeling.

351
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,983
That I can't lose.

352
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,527
It's like my theme song.

353
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,243
Tonight was the last night for that song.

354
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,622
The last Diamond Dust song I'll ever sing.

355
00:19:25,955 --> 00:19:26,749
I...

356
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,334
Okay, next song.

357
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,513
Ow...

358
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,350
Oh, it's just you.

359
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:46,435
Good morning.

360
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:51,816
By the time you read this, I'll be gone,
and the movers will have probably started.

361
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,862
I'm going to go pick up my last paycheck
and wait at the station for my train.

362
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:01,117
Anyway, I want you to have my guitar.

363
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,619
Enjoy your new life in Tokyo.

364
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,999
Sorry!

365
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,334
I'll unlock it now.

366
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,004
Yes, thank you.

367
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,013
GOOD LUCK!!

368
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:34,150
MIDDLE FINGER UP!

369
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,527
I'll be right back!

370
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,674
Momoka.

371
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,426
Momoka...

372
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,055
Momoka...

373
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:12,980
I'm sorry!

374
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:14,690
- What?!
- Hey, you!

375
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,443
Momoka!

376
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,612
Are you really sure?!

377
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,490
If you stop, it all ends!

378
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:27,453
If you say it's over,
then it really is over!

379
00:21:28,244 --> 00:21:29,413
You okay?

380
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,459
I'm going to say something
really stubborn and selfish now!

381
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,962
I came here because I didn't want to lose!

382
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:40,174
So I don't want you to lose either!

383
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,260
Please...

384
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:48,307
raise your middle finger with me!

385
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,238
You can sing it, right?

386
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:05,616
Yes!

387
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:13,666
It's so blank
It's so long

388
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:18,838
The answers tend to be superficial clichés

389
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:23,551
Whether my fingers tremble or not

390
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:30,224
I'm currently at a crossroads
You won't find on any map

391
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:37,106
What should I use to guide me?

392
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:40,234
People often say to follow the book

393
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,778
So many words I don't understand

394
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:48,742
Today is no different than that day

395
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:56,417
Will filling in this blank
Solve everything someday?

396
00:22:56,584 --> 00:23:02,131
How would you move forward?

397
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:05,551
It's so blank
It's so long

398
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:10,681
The answers tend to be superficial clichés

399
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:15,311
Whether my fingers tremble or not

400
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,355
There's no right answer
There's no losing

401
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:23,694
I've been me all my life
That's all there is

402
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:29,950
No matter how much I fight
There's no tomorrow

403
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,796
No matter how much I resist
There's no tomorrow

404
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,970
Next episode,
"Three Nocturnal Creatures."
