1
00:00:12,821 --> 00:00:14,574
They're so cool!

2
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,702
What? You want to play guitar too?

3
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:21,329
I've never played,
but do you think I could?

4
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:24,792
Could I play like you, Momoka?

5
00:00:29,422 --> 00:00:30,214
Forget it.

6
00:00:30,381 --> 00:00:34,135
You've got no experience.
You'll end up neglecting your singing.

7
00:00:35,386 --> 00:00:37,555
Doesn't seem like she hears you at all.

8
00:00:37,722 --> 00:00:41,851
Well, people tend to become like this
after their first performance.

9
00:00:42,018 --> 00:00:45,062
Wow, look at her.
Like she had meant for all this to happen.

10
00:00:47,273 --> 00:00:50,735
Shouting the things I'm feeling...

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,240
at the top of my lungs
while giving it my all.

12
00:01:02,205 --> 00:01:05,124
It was the first time
I ever did something like that.

13
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:11,130
Before, I would always care so much
about what other people thought of me,

14
00:01:11,297 --> 00:01:12,882
I often choked on my words.

15
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:16,469
Nina!

16
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:20,890
Let's go practice!

17
00:01:23,226 --> 00:01:24,018
Okay!

18
00:01:24,977 --> 00:01:27,938
This unfinished beat covers the night

19
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:30,816
Embracing us before we're crushed

20
00:01:30,983 --> 00:01:35,530
Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand

21
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:38,366
There will be change
If you just reach out

22
00:01:44,163 --> 00:01:48,125
Crying in a crowd with a voiceless voice

23
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:52,380
Come morning
The footsteps drown out the voice

24
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:56,509
No matter how much time passes
It never dries

25
00:01:56,676 --> 00:02:01,097
The cold, muddy waters of a decaying city

26
00:02:01,264 --> 00:02:02,598
In a world where nothing changes

27
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,434
We have to live through it

28
00:02:06,602 --> 00:02:08,729
It may be dumb, but we have no choice

29
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,482
We've already started walking

30
00:02:11,649 --> 00:02:14,651
It may seem unreal
It may seem stupid

31
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,446
This hopeless city of ours

32
00:02:17,613 --> 00:02:19,740
But I still saw it with my own eyes

33
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:22,618
I touched it with these hands
See? See?

34
00:02:22,785 --> 00:02:25,913
See? There it goes again
It's so stupid

35
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,749
Shine a light through
The hopeless darkness

36
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,918
This isn't a dream
Even in a dead city

37
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:33,963
Giving up won't change anything
Even now, now

38
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,466
Now, this unfinished beat covers the night

39
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:40,303
Embracing us before we're crushed

40
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:45,056
Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand

41
00:02:45,224 --> 00:02:47,727
There will be change
If you just reach out

42
00:02:55,526 --> 00:02:58,904
APPRECIATION (SURPRISE)

43
00:02:59,071 --> 00:03:00,489
Okay, stop.

44
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:02,700
What do you think?

45
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:03,868
Looks good.

46
00:03:04,535 --> 00:03:05,328
Let's play it back.

47
00:03:05,494 --> 00:03:06,871
I want to break it

48
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:08,913
I don't have the courage

49
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:14,544
Oh! Sounds good.

50
00:03:14,712 --> 00:03:16,756
There are so many people

51
00:03:16,922 --> 00:03:20,885
Nina, can you modulate more
when you enter the chorus?

52
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,849
Someone hurry up and teach me
A reason to live

53
00:03:27,016 --> 00:03:28,017
Like that?

54
00:03:28,184 --> 00:03:30,853
Yeah. It was kinda obvious and boring.

55
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,272
And let's retake the drums.

56
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,024
What, now?

57
00:03:35,191 --> 00:03:37,693
I have to get up early tomorrow.

58
00:03:40,196 --> 00:03:41,572
Diamond Dust?

59
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:45,826
Yeah. She was looking them up online.
I bet they're getting in her head.

60
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:49,038
Yeah, but they're a hit band.

61
00:03:49,205 --> 00:03:50,831
That's true, but...

62
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:53,000
If she really was wary of them,

63
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:55,586
she wouldn't have recruited
amateurs like us.

64
00:03:56,587 --> 00:03:57,463
But...

65
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,257
- Hm?
- Hm?

66
00:04:01,717 --> 00:04:03,511
What? No way...

67
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,179
No way!

68
00:04:05,888 --> 00:04:06,722
What's wrong?

69
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:08,516
Sorry, I have to go now!

70
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:09,475
Huh?

71
00:04:09,642 --> 00:04:11,018
See you tomorrow!

72
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:11,977
What?

73
00:04:15,606 --> 00:04:17,525
She's not reading our texts.

74
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,484
It's a guy then.

75
00:04:18,651 --> 00:04:19,485
What?!

76
00:04:19,652 --> 00:04:22,446
But it really didn't seem like
she was dating.

77
00:04:22,613 --> 00:04:24,865
Maybe she's trying to get back with an ex.

78
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:26,701
W-What are you saying?!

79
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,994
Why are you so upset?

80
00:04:29,161 --> 00:04:31,163
B-Because...

81
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:33,499
Is she really...?

82
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:37,128
Girls in bands do get attention
from guys in bands.

83
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:39,964
They see us as easy prey.

84
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,382
"Easy prey"?

85
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:43,509
You should be careful, too.

86
00:04:44,593 --> 00:04:45,386
I'll call her.

87
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:46,803
She won't answer.

88
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:48,389
We'll find out tomorrow.

89
00:04:49,014 --> 00:04:53,017
But I think we should be free to choose
who we date and where we work.

90
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,147
What do you think about them?

91
00:04:56,313 --> 00:04:57,148
Hm?

92
00:04:58,023 --> 00:05:00,025
The current Diamond Dust.

93
00:05:01,944 --> 00:05:04,279
Nothing really.

94
00:05:04,447 --> 00:05:05,781
What do you mean?

95
00:05:05,948 --> 00:05:09,034
I don't hate them or anything.

96
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:12,788
I honestly wish them the best.

97
00:05:12,955 --> 00:05:15,499
Then why did you quit?

98
00:05:18,961 --> 00:05:20,880
We don't need to talk about that.

99
00:05:21,046 --> 00:05:24,467
Stop worrying about these things.
Just focus on singing.

100
00:05:29,305 --> 00:05:31,557
What kind of band were you?

101
00:05:32,183 --> 00:05:33,684
I said drop it.

102
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:35,311
Please tell me.

103
00:05:46,238 --> 00:05:47,031
Here.

104
00:05:47,198 --> 00:05:49,158
Whoa... Hm?

105
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:51,410
We started out as a school music club.

106
00:05:51,577 --> 00:05:55,414
But everyone was already good.
And we had passion.

107
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,502
We all had the same goal
and it felt like fate.

108
00:05:59,668 --> 00:06:02,671
It felt so much like a miracle
I got goosebumps.

109
00:06:02,838 --> 00:06:04,924
My prediction was right.

110
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:07,301
We packed our entire gym with a crowd

111
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:11,263
at the fall school festival
in our freshman year.

112
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,432
We were the closing act. It was awesome.

113
00:06:14,058 --> 00:06:17,436
So we decided to
drop out of school to go pro

114
00:06:17,603 --> 00:06:19,980
and we moved here, put out a CD ourselves,

115
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:22,690
played some shows
and came close to a major debut.

116
00:06:22,858 --> 00:06:25,194
That's when I quit.

117
00:06:27,363 --> 00:06:28,531
Momoka.

118
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:33,327
So this is how you smile.

119
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,757
Sorry, I wasn't sleeping.

120
00:06:46,924 --> 00:06:47,716
Huh?

121
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:54,515
I should've just slept in my bed.

122
00:07:01,146 --> 00:07:02,731
It's from Subaru!

123
00:07:02,898 --> 00:07:04,483
Hm? Huh? What?!

124
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,235
HEY
IS THERE SOMEONE YOU LIKE?

125
00:07:06,402 --> 00:07:07,736
Hey!

126
00:07:10,614 --> 00:07:12,741
This isn't a good idea.

127
00:07:12,908 --> 00:07:17,079
Why? The three of us made a pact
to do this together!

128
00:07:17,246 --> 00:07:19,248
Are you really giving up already?

129
00:07:19,415 --> 00:07:21,292
It's not that I'm giving up.

130
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,877
She can always dump the guy and come back.

131
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,797
Try to force it
and it might reignite their spark.

132
00:07:26,964 --> 00:07:29,008
What? Really?

133
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:33,095
Wait, have you never dated a guy?

134
00:07:33,262 --> 00:07:35,097
Have you?

135
00:07:36,682 --> 00:07:39,143
Excuse us.

136
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,020
What are you doing?

137
00:07:41,186 --> 00:07:44,148
This place makes me nervous.

138
00:07:44,857 --> 00:07:47,401
Please take charge
since you're our leader.

139
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,028
Since when?!

140
00:07:49,194 --> 00:07:54,283
Also, Subaru acts pretty annoying here,
but don't let that get to you.

141
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,451
Huh?

142
00:07:55,618 --> 00:07:56,619
Oh?

143
00:08:00,205 --> 00:08:01,332
Subaru...

144
00:08:01,498 --> 00:08:02,499
What?

145
00:08:10,382 --> 00:08:13,260
Grandmother. It's this way.

146
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:26,148
May I help you?

147
00:08:26,315 --> 00:08:28,025
- Suba...
- What? You're lost?

148
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:31,445
Grandmother,
I'll just go help her very quickly.

149
00:08:34,365 --> 00:08:36,200
Why did you come here?!

150
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:39,453
Of course we'd come
after that text you sent!

151
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,623
I'll explain later! Please go home!

152
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,958
At least tell me the reason!

153
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,543
I just said...

154
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,836
Who are they?

155
00:08:48,504 --> 00:08:49,672
Grandmother.

156
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:53,384
Th-They're my actor friends.

157
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,343
Actors?

158
00:08:58,764 --> 00:09:00,766
Right?

159
00:09:03,727 --> 00:09:06,981
It's so lively here,
it's a bit overwhelming.

160
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,607
Yes, it's very crowded.

161
00:09:11,402 --> 00:09:12,611
Subaru.

162
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:14,363
- Posture.
- Yes, ma'am!

163
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,741
I always tell you
to maintain good posture.

164
00:09:17,908 --> 00:09:22,413
Your regular mannerisms
will always come out in your acting,

165
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:26,125
so you must always maintain
a healthy mind and body.

166
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,127
Yes, Grandmother.

167
00:09:28,293 --> 00:09:33,465
Feel free to remind her
whenever you see her do something wrong.

168
00:09:33,631 --> 00:09:35,384
Please excuse me.

169
00:09:39,221 --> 00:09:40,264
Subaru!

170
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:41,390
I know, I know.

171
00:09:41,557 --> 00:09:44,601
Was that the actress Tendo Awa?

172
00:09:44,768 --> 00:09:45,894
You just noticed?

173
00:09:46,061 --> 00:09:48,772
How was I supposed to know?

174
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:50,857
Yes, she's my grandma.

175
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:53,777
She told me yesterday
that she'd be visiting.

176
00:09:53,944 --> 00:09:56,280
Wait, are you from
a family of celebrities?

177
00:09:56,447 --> 00:09:58,240
It's not like that.

178
00:09:58,407 --> 00:10:00,325
My parents have normal jobs.

179
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,287
You don't want to be an actor, right?

180
00:10:03,453 --> 00:10:07,416
I don't.
But I told you that I can't tell her now.

181
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:10,753
Then why did you say
you were quitting the band?!

182
00:10:13,422 --> 00:10:15,506
I kinda freaked out.

183
00:10:15,674 --> 00:10:18,927
And they say to trick your friends
to trick your enemies.

184
00:10:19,928 --> 00:10:21,096
I don't get it.

185
00:10:21,263 --> 00:10:24,475
That's how committed
I need to be to trick her.

186
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:27,059
She seems nice though.

187
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,854
On the surface, sure.

188
00:10:29,021 --> 00:10:30,606
But she's from Kyoto,

189
00:10:30,773 --> 00:10:34,068
which means you shouldn't take
what she says at face value.

190
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,069
Really?

191
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,528
- Posture.
- Yes, ma'am!

192
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:42,326
I'd like to get back and see
how much your acting has improved.

193
00:10:42,493 --> 00:10:43,577
W-What?

194
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:46,580
Would you two like to join us?

195
00:10:47,122 --> 00:10:49,208
- W-What?
- W-What?

196
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,086
W-What is it?

197
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:57,216
Well, t-truthfully, I actually like you.

198
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:01,595
Don't laugh!

199
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,597
An étude?

200
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:06,350
Yes, a lovers' étude.

201
00:11:06,517 --> 00:11:09,311
You confess your love to her,

202
00:11:09,477 --> 00:11:12,397
just as her ex, Subaru,
comes to win her back.

203
00:11:12,564 --> 00:11:13,857
- I... see.
- I... see.

204
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:18,362
That's wonderful, Grandmother.

205
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:21,782
Let's head back to the school and try.

206
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:23,575
Are you ready?

207
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:28,789
No thank you.

208
00:11:33,877 --> 00:11:36,463
Oh, it seems Nina didn't hear you well.

209
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:39,091
Just do it!

210
00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:42,094
Do it if you want me in the band!

211
00:11:44,221 --> 00:11:47,224
You can't talk about the étude beforehand
on your phones.

212
00:11:47,391 --> 00:11:48,767
Y-Yes, ma'am!

213
00:11:49,434 --> 00:11:51,770
Let us go then.

214
00:11:54,022 --> 00:11:54,815
Wait!

215
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:56,482
Y-You're...

216
00:11:57,276 --> 00:12:01,196
I don't want to lie to myself anymore.

217
00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:03,866
I love you too!

218
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,706
Then why did you break up with me?

219
00:12:10,873 --> 00:12:11,957
What?

220
00:12:12,124 --> 00:12:15,043
I was committed to us from the very start.

221
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,546
I was sure we'd never split up.

222
00:12:17,713 --> 00:12:20,716
So how could you say
that you were leaving so easily?

223
00:12:20,883 --> 00:12:21,925
Well...

224
00:12:22,092 --> 00:12:23,218
How could you?!

225
00:12:23,385 --> 00:12:26,304
Did you lie when you said
you were serious about us?

226
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:29,975
No, I was serious about that.

227
00:12:30,142 --> 00:12:31,852
Then what?!

228
00:12:47,784 --> 00:12:51,371
That was low, unloading all that
during the improv!

229
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:53,123
What's the problem?

230
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,458
I know you're not satisfied.

231
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,919
I'm not looking to quit the band.

232
00:12:57,085 --> 00:13:02,591
Besides, everyone in the industry
just sees me as Tendo Awa's granddaughter.

233
00:13:02,758 --> 00:13:04,009
- It's just...
- What?

234
00:13:05,928 --> 00:13:07,511
It's been bugging me.

235
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,307
My grandma normally wouldn't just drop by.

236
00:13:10,474 --> 00:13:13,977
She's not a spontaneous person at all.

237
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:19,566
So this is why!

238
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,111
Girls Band Cry.

239
00:13:24,488 --> 00:13:26,073
Appearing in a drama?!

240
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,034
The feedback!
Don't use the mic for talking!

241
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:32,328
I don't have a choice, my grandma decided.

242
00:13:32,496 --> 00:13:36,541
It's a minor role,
so I should be done after a week,

243
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,085
but I'll miss practice.

244
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:39,086
Got it.

245
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:40,087
Really?

246
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:43,966
You skip practice to study too, Nina!

247
00:13:44,131 --> 00:13:45,717
That's different.

248
00:13:45,884 --> 00:13:46,718
It's the same!

249
00:13:46,885 --> 00:13:48,053
No!

250
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:52,391
Don't fight.

251
00:13:52,557 --> 00:13:55,352
But... Subaru might not come back!

252
00:13:55,894 --> 00:13:57,479
It happens all the time.

253
00:13:57,646 --> 00:13:58,772
But...

254
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:00,482
What are you so mad about?

255
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:03,235
Because you don't seem to care.

256
00:14:03,402 --> 00:14:06,655
You're the one who doesn't seem to care!

257
00:14:06,822 --> 00:14:08,699
I told you I'm coming back.

258
00:14:08,865 --> 00:14:10,367
Why can't you trust me?

259
00:14:10,534 --> 00:14:11,493
But...

260
00:14:12,035 --> 00:14:15,998
Look, everyone has personal issues
they don't want to share.

261
00:14:16,707 --> 00:14:20,002
You don't like being asked about
why you moved here, right?

262
00:14:20,168 --> 00:14:20,961
That's...

263
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:22,421
We're wasting time.

264
00:14:22,587 --> 00:14:26,008
We'll just re-record Subaru's part today,
so you can leave, Nina.

265
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,138
What is their problem?!
I am being caring!

266
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:32,347
Seriously...

267
00:14:32,514 --> 00:14:33,306
Huh?

268
00:14:35,183 --> 00:14:36,810
You free tomorrow?

269
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:38,270
No!

270
00:14:41,064 --> 00:14:42,274
I lied. I am!

271
00:14:45,444 --> 00:14:47,029
Where are we?

272
00:14:47,195 --> 00:14:48,822
Hm? This is my home.

273
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:50,282
Come on in.

274
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:51,408
THE NEXT DAY

275
00:14:52,242 --> 00:14:54,411
Oh, wow.

276
00:14:55,954 --> 00:14:57,497
You get over it quickly.

277
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,791
- Is tea fine?
- Oh, yeah.

278
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:02,544
Sit wherever you want.

279
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:10,052
That's the best seat for gaming.

280
00:15:10,218 --> 00:15:11,261
Thanks.

281
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:13,138
Look at this.

282
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:18,894
She's so pretty.

283
00:15:20,062 --> 00:15:24,441
I figured I should tell you
since you might moan about it later.

284
00:15:24,983 --> 00:15:26,943
STARRING TENDO AWA (UP-AND-COMER)

285
00:15:28,987 --> 00:15:32,074
I was named after this title.

286
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,451
My grandma picked it.

287
00:15:35,077 --> 00:15:37,704
Wait, is she your...

288
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:42,292
Yeah, she said this movie made her famous
when she was young.

289
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:45,378
I wasn't born yet, so I don't really know.

290
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:47,297
Mm.

291
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:52,803
But she said it's an auspicious name
if I'm going to be an actor.

292
00:15:54,805 --> 00:15:56,848
But you don't want to be.

293
00:15:57,015 --> 00:16:02,229
Yeah. I can't stand getting
special treatment for who my grandma is.

294
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:05,399
And I just don't like acting.
I get embarrassed.

295
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:13,240
But when I tell her
that I'm trying to become an actor,

296
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:14,491
she smiles.

297
00:16:14,658 --> 00:16:17,661
It's the only time she really smiles.

298
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:19,621
Not a forced one.

299
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:32,843
What do you think?

300
00:16:33,969 --> 00:16:35,887
What would you do?

301
00:16:37,472 --> 00:16:38,431
There.

302
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:42,477
Do you see now where I'm coming from?

303
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:45,480
But something has to change.

304
00:16:45,647 --> 00:16:48,733
You should tell her soon
if you don't want to act.

305
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:50,735
Right?

306
00:16:52,654 --> 00:16:53,738
Yeah.

307
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:58,827
It's too bad.
I figured if I went to acting school,

308
00:16:58,994 --> 00:17:01,997
she'd realize I can't act
and give up on me.

309
00:17:03,206 --> 00:17:04,791
- Bye.
- Yeah.

310
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:07,502
Don't worry, I won't quit the band.

311
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:09,254
- Really?
- Yeah.

312
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:12,382
When we did our live show,

313
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:15,510
I kinda realized that
I really like hitting the drums.

314
00:17:20,348 --> 00:17:21,433
Ow...

315
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,269
It's rare for me to open up,
so at least say something!

316
00:17:25,395 --> 00:17:26,188
Yeah.

317
00:17:27,856 --> 00:17:29,148
Hm? What's this?

318
00:17:34,863 --> 00:17:37,115
I'm sorry. From Nina.

319
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:43,163
Then try to not get so mad
in the first place.

320
00:17:44,205 --> 00:17:47,375
Welcome to
The Detective Granny Case Files Part 6!

321
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:49,794
This is Tendo Awa who plays Granny!

322
00:17:50,545 --> 00:17:51,671
Thank you.

323
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:55,258
I'm her granddaughter, Subaru.
I'll be playing the store clerk.

324
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:56,968
It's nice to meet you all.

325
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:01,806
That's a lot of makeup.

326
00:18:01,973 --> 00:18:04,351
You need that much to see it on camera.

327
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,686
It's the same on stage.

328
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,230
You do makeup?

329
00:18:08,396 --> 00:18:10,065
Depending on the situation.

330
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:12,943
Stop imagining it.

331
00:18:13,777 --> 00:18:14,694
Okay, ready!

332
00:18:15,654 --> 00:18:17,239
She's really gonna tell her?

333
00:18:17,405 --> 00:18:19,115
Yeah, that's what she said.

334
00:18:19,282 --> 00:18:21,826
She might need to quit her school

335
00:18:21,993 --> 00:18:25,080
and move back home,
but she wants to stay in the band.

336
00:18:25,247 --> 00:18:29,584
If it's that big of a deal,
she doesn't have to tell her.

337
00:18:29,751 --> 00:18:31,127
I know.

338
00:18:31,294 --> 00:18:34,339
But she knew
she eventually had to one day.

339
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:36,174
Okay!

340
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:39,219
Checking the footage!

341
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:41,596
Are you sure we can be here?

342
00:18:42,597 --> 00:18:44,808
Yes, I'm done for today.

343
00:18:45,433 --> 00:18:47,352
It was our first time acting together.

344
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,853
That's great.

345
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:51,356
It's been my dream...

346
00:18:53,692 --> 00:18:56,444
to appear in the same title as her.

347
00:18:59,489 --> 00:19:01,992
Do you really want her to be an actor?

348
00:19:02,157 --> 00:19:03,243
Of course.

349
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,748
Subaru was named after the role
that gave me my big break.

350
00:19:09,374 --> 00:19:13,420
You see, my daughter hates my job.

351
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:15,297
She says I'm never home

352
00:19:15,463 --> 00:19:18,758
and I'm too bossy for someone
who can't take care of a home.

353
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:25,265
That's why it made me so happy
when Subaru said she liked my job.

354
00:19:26,891 --> 00:19:29,269
She was the only one to smile.

355
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:33,315
The only one who liked my job.

356
00:19:33,481 --> 00:19:35,275
And when she said she wanted to try,

357
00:19:35,984 --> 00:19:37,359
I was so grateful.

358
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:39,362
Okay!

359
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:40,530
Checking the footage!

360
00:19:42,032 --> 00:19:44,743
Now, shall we go check?

361
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:48,663
Grandmother!

362
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,041
Ah, good work.

363
00:19:53,585 --> 00:19:56,129
Um, I'd like to talk to you
about something.

364
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:58,465
What is this about?

365
00:19:59,257 --> 00:20:04,137
It should probably wait, but you need to
catch your bullet train, right?

366
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:07,140
Yes, I should be going soon.

367
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,892
Right.

368
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:11,102
Then I'll say it.

369
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:12,771
The thing is...

370
00:20:14,606 --> 00:20:15,398
Um...

371
00:20:16,191 --> 00:20:17,734
I...

372
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:20,779
Grandmother.

373
00:20:21,905 --> 00:20:22,696
I...

374
00:20:25,617 --> 00:20:26,451
I...

375
00:20:26,618 --> 00:20:28,119
Subaru, come quick!

376
00:20:28,286 --> 00:20:29,079
- What?
- Hm?

377
00:20:29,244 --> 00:20:32,040
You forgot something! We need to go!

378
00:20:32,207 --> 00:20:33,166
Huh?

379
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,127
We have to go now! Come on, let's go!

380
00:20:36,294 --> 00:20:39,672
What? Ow! Hey!

381
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,425
Ow. Don't push me!

382
00:20:43,301 --> 00:20:45,470
Hey! What...

383
00:20:47,597 --> 00:20:49,432
Your words don't match your actions!

384
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:50,683
I'm sorry!

385
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,935
Keep it down!

386
00:20:52,102 --> 00:20:56,106
You're the one who said
I should come clean and tell her already!

387
00:20:56,272 --> 00:20:58,691
- I did!
- How can you say that proudly?!

388
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,944
I finally got ready to tell her!

389
00:21:01,111 --> 00:21:02,237
Well...

390
00:21:02,404 --> 00:21:04,948
Everyone has their own personal issues.

391
00:21:05,115 --> 00:21:05,949
Huh?

392
00:21:06,574 --> 00:21:10,744
It's not easy, but you need to
grow to be more understanding.

393
00:21:10,912 --> 00:21:11,705
Right?

394
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,289
That's rich coming from you!

395
00:21:13,455 --> 00:21:14,833
Ow!

396
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:18,670
I knew that already, unlike you!

397
00:21:18,837 --> 00:21:19,838
And you just...

398
00:21:20,004 --> 00:21:23,299
But you will have to tell her eventually!

399
00:21:23,465 --> 00:21:24,551
When?

400
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:27,303
When you find something you want to do.

401
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:29,556
What's her problem?

402
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:31,099
I don't know.

403
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:37,981
I'm over it! I'm so over this!

404
00:21:38,606 --> 00:21:41,693
I finally made up my mind
because you told me not to quit.

405
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:45,196
But now I'm stuck with a Morality Monster
who suddenly changes her mind

406
00:21:46,156 --> 00:21:48,575
and someone who gets it,
but won't help.

407
00:21:51,286 --> 00:21:54,372
I'll make my own decisions,
so leave me alone!

408
00:21:55,665 --> 00:21:57,083
Subaru...

409
00:22:04,048 --> 00:22:06,384
How was my acting?

410
00:22:06,551 --> 00:22:08,386
Wow, I feel so much better.

411
00:22:08,553 --> 00:22:12,390
It's fine, I know I'll have to
deal with it eventually.

412
00:22:13,016 --> 00:22:16,394
So I'll be here
kicking your asses forward until then!

413
00:22:17,811 --> 00:22:18,897
Let's go then!

414
00:22:21,523 --> 00:22:24,486
Never influenced by anybody
Never becoming anybody

415
00:22:24,694 --> 00:22:27,489
I laughed, thinking it a dream

416
00:22:27,696 --> 00:22:30,575
Numbed by the weakness I had forgotten

417
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:33,578
I can't even say that I'm lonely

418
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:39,292
This fragile heart
Vulnerable to even casual conversation

419
00:22:40,376 --> 00:22:45,423
Is incapable of making anyone happy

420
00:22:46,758 --> 00:22:52,638
But still, I feel a growing hope

421
00:22:52,847 --> 00:22:58,603
Moving past all of the lies

422
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:02,023
I just want to hear
That I'm not wrong

423
00:23:02,232 --> 00:23:05,151
I'm a dreamer, I'm young

424
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,780
I don't care if I'm still the same today

425
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:11,366
I just want to sing with you

426
00:23:11,574 --> 00:23:14,744
My emotions stir so often

427
00:23:14,953 --> 00:23:17,914
I've been hated

428
00:23:18,122 --> 00:23:21,251
But I'm going to keep walking

429
00:23:21,459 --> 00:23:27,465
Proud of myself
Who can never become anybody

430
00:23:28,132 --> 00:23:30,635
Even if I'm alone

431
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:34,097
I believe in myself

432
00:23:34,305 --> 00:23:41,145
Every time I get hurt, I just need to sing

433
00:23:47,777 --> 00:23:49,946
