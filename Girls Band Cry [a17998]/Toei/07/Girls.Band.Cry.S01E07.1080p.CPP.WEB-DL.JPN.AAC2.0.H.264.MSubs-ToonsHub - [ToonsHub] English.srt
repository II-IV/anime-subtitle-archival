1
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:13,514
T-shirts for sale!

2
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:15,641
We also have towels!

3
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,768
Thank you!

4
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,062
Thank...

5
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:27,653
That's why I told you
not to bother with merchandise.

6
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:31,615
Why did you make these when
we haven't even decided on a band name?

7
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:36,078
Well, I thought it could
help fund our activities.

8
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:37,787
What are we, a soccer team?

9
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:42,918
But I guess it might become valuable
if we become famous.

10
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:44,670
You're way too positive.

11
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:46,797
Hey!

12
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,424
Stop spacing out!

13
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:51,969
I'm rooting for you!

14
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,595
I believe in you!

15
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,931
I'm coming to your next show too!

16
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,517
Yes, please do!

17
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,979
Wow, Rupa's so popular.

18
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,357
More importantly,
we need to decide on a band name.

19
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:06,316
Okay.

20
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,566
Got a second?

21
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,446
Yes?

22
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,992
This unfinished beat covers the night

23
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,869
Embracing us before we're crushed

24
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:22,581
Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand

25
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,419
There will be change
If you just reach out

26
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:35,178
Crying in a crowd with a voiceless voice

27
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:39,433
Come morning
The footsteps drown out the voice

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,562
No matter how much time passes
It never dries

29
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:48,150
The cold, muddy waters of a decaying city

30
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,651
In a world where nothing changes

31
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:52,487
We have to live through it

32
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,782
It may be dumb, but we have no choice

33
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,535
We've already started walking

34
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,705
It may seem unreal
It may seem stupid

35
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,499
This hopeless city of ours

36
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,793
But I still saw it with my own eyes

37
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,671
I touched it with these hands
See? See?

38
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,966
See? There it goes again
It's so stupid

39
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,802
Shine a light through
The hopeless darkness

40
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,971
This isn't a dream
Even in a dead city

41
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,016
Giving up won't change anything
Even now, now

42
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:24,519
Now, this unfinished beat covers the night

43
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,356
Embracing us before we're crushed

44
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:32,110
Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand

45
00:02:32,276 --> 00:02:34,780
There will be change
If you just reach out

46
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,705
A live show?

47
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:47,501
Yeah. Someone who helped me
when I was starting out

48
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,627
asked if we wanted to play.

49
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,213
Where is it?

50
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,006
Suwa in Nagano.

51
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,425
We'll arrive the day before to rehearse.
The show will be the next night

52
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,053
then we'll head home right after,

53
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,847
so I can go do this by myself
if you're busy.

54
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,684
And I'm sure
you have studying to do, Nina.

55
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:04,851
I'll go.

56
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,770
- Okay?!
- Seriously?

57
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,522
We're still out of sync.

58
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,983
But the more shows we play the better.

59
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,861
Okay, if you say so, Rupa.

60
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,322
So we're in!

61
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:18,615
Okay.

62
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,367
Uh...

63
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:21,743
What?

64
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,413
What were we gonna do
about our band name again?

65
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:30,877
Just so you know,
I'm really quitting if it's Shinkawasaki.

66
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,629
I know.

67
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:36,216
I mean, we're aiming
to go professional as well.

68
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,137
Has Momoka said anything since?

69
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,596
No.

70
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:47,394
She didn't even say anything
about us really trying to go pro.

71
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,271
A cold war.

72
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,732
Why do you seem happy?

73
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,318
Momoka tends to make
snide comments to Nina.

74
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,903
Huh? Where's the lizard?

75
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,155
Gecko!

76
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,283
I temporarily moved it
because it wasn't feeling well.

77
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,285
What the hell?!

78
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:06,204
If she wants to say something,
then she should say it!

79
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,873
You're bothering the neighbors!

80
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:13,962
I think it's natural to assume she's mad
because you keep making decisions, Nina.

81
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,964
This was your idea.

82
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:17,924
Tehee.

83
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,803
Just so you know, if this is
going to be a fight, we're both out.

84
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,513
We don't have the time.

85
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,475
I know that. Geez...

86
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:30,395
So, what are we going to do
about the name of the band

87
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:33,064
whose members are all over the place?

88
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,942
- Do you have any ideas?
- What? Me?

89
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,903
You suggest one first!

90
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,738
Yeah! You should suggest one
before asking others!

91
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:43,325
What? I'm too embarrassed.

92
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:46,077
What if the three of you say it
at the same time?

93
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,121
If you say so, Rupa.

94
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,665
Okay, we say it together.

95
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:51,666
Okay.

96
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,335
Ready, and...

97
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,128
- Chocolate.
- Undine.

98
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,423
Ready, and...

99
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,091
- Chocolate.
- Undine.

100
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,140
It wouldn't be in katakana.
"Chocolate" in hiragana.

101
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,391
What a suggestion.

102
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,185
You stubborn Kumamoto girl.

103
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,103
It sounds cavity-inducing.

104
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,146
That's mean!

105
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,190
What did you say? "Undine"?

106
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,315
That's...

107
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,652
It's way more embarrassing than mine.

108
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,779
What?! Are you crazy?

109
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,488
They're both terrible.

110
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,866
Then what's yours?

111
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,369
Yeah, say it again.

112
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,829
Dream Girl.

113
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:34,876
Any progress?

114
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,255
I had no idea we'd have this much trouble.

115
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,758
That's because
you're being so picky, Subaru.

116
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:46,012
I'd like to say the exact same about you.

117
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,146
"Did you settle on a name?"

118
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,607
So annoying.

119
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,904
We basically wasted the entire day.

120
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,787
She's so late...

121
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,289
Sis!

122
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:17,210
You could've messaged me!

123
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,546
I wanted to surprise you.

124
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,173
But I didn't think you'd be this late.

125
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:24,467
I usually don't stay out this late.

126
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,969
Things just ran long today.

127
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,512
You got a boyfriend?

128
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,683
Are you doing something weird for money?

129
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:35,562
Then what?

130
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,564
A band.

131
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,565
What?

132
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,815
A band.

133
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,192
A band?

134
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,694
Yeah.

135
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,742
You? Really? Are you serious?

136
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,951
Do you have pictures?

137
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:50,994
I do.

138
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,457
Whoa, you're serious. Are you the singer?

139
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:56,625
Wow.

140
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,209
What's with this outfit?

141
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,586
That's...

142
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,171
rock and roll.

143
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:02,714
Rock and roll.

144
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,424
What's that?

145
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,843
What does it matter?

146
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,888
That's why your grades crashed.

147
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,848
How did you know that?

148
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,517
Your cram school reached out
after your grades dropped

149
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,686
and you kept missing a bunch of classes.

150
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,271
That's so unnecessary.

151
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,816
Just be thankful that
I stopped Dad from coming.

152
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,737
What will you tell him?

153
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,740
I'm leaving home.

154
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,204
That's fine,

155
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:38,083
but that means you'll never be
able to come home again.

156
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:43,004
You know, I do think Dad was in the wrong.

157
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:54,182
He was revered enough as a teacher
to have written about education.

158
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:57,519
he couldn't accept
his own daughter's truancy.

159
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,774
I know you must have been hurt.

160
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,152
But I also see where Dad's coming from.

161
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,990
At the very least,
if we had overlooked the bullying,

162
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,991
the school would've owed us.

163
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,120
You could've easily gotten
recommendations with your grades.

164
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,956
That's cheating.

165
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:22,544
Which is why you said you'd come here
and make it to college on your own, right?

166
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,924
But now you're abandoning that
and leaving home?

167
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,260
Even I can't support you on that.

168
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,141
Come on, hurry.
We have rehearsals tomorrow morning.

169
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,726
Okay.

170
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,602
Sorry I'm late!

171
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,896
What is all that?

172
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,106
Is something wrong?

173
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,732
Show me.

174
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,318
This and this...

175
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,945
The rest are clothes, right?

176
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,655
Leave everything else.

177
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:51,823
What?!

178
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,868
You have to pack as light as you can.

179
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,495
Now then.

180
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,498
The Chuo Expressway, right?

181
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,916
Then just go...

182
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,043
Quiet.

183
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,880
A manual transmission? That's rare.

184
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:11,051
I asked an acquaintance
and this was all they had.

185
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,010
Uh...

186
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,386
I think...

187
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,015
Oh, did that do it?

188
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,897
Who votes for a new driver?

189
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,027
Rupa, you're a great driver.

190
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:32,405
I used to drive at my last job.

191
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,909
We'll make a rest stop, so could you
drive all the way there?

192
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,410
You hate my driving that much?

193
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,875
I'll stop at a rest area if I get tired,

194
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,044
so you guys can all rest.

195
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:49,339
What? But we're all here together.

196
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,006
Want to play a game then?

197
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:54,385
If everyone raises their hand
to your question, you win.

198
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,054
For example...
Who likes cats better than dogs?

199
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,475
Wow, I'm surprised Tomo's a dog person.

200
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:03,812
They say cat-like people
tend to love dogs.

201
00:10:03,977 --> 00:10:05,563
You're next, Nina.

202
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,773
Um...

203
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,484
Who has few friends?

204
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,821
Yes!

205
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,323
Don't end the game so fast!

206
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,450
Momoka's up next.

207
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,203
What? What a pain...

208
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:24,457
Fine. Who hates my driving?

209
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,963
Let's take a break.

210
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,381
We'll be right back.

211
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,054
So cold!

212
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,348
Stop that!

213
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:41,599
Rock paper scissors!

214
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,351
When are we leaving again?

215
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,477
Excuse me.

216
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,482
What took you so long?

217
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:52,485
What is this?

218
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,987
Did you want something else?

219
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,489
I mean, it's fine.

220
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,949
Good.

221
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,330
Tomo...

222
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,583
why did you quit school?

223
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,751
Why are you asking?

224
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,754
Because I have nobody else to ask.

225
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,425
I didn't have time to waste there.

226
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,260
My parents were never around

227
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:21,222
so I knew I'd be on my own
after graduation.

228
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,643
Mom?

229
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,652
She was acting like someone else
with another man.

230
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,698
Seeing my mom like that,
it flipped a switch in me.

231
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:43,453
It's not rare to see singers
who are 18 or 20 years old these days.

232
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,664
So the earlier I start, the better.

233
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,418
Which is why I came to Tokyo
and recruited band members.

234
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,172
The time I had spent at school
seemed like a waste.

235
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:55,673
That's all.

236
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:57,383
Wow.

237
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:01,054
I never even thought like that.

238
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:05,642
Anybody would think like that
if they had nobody to rely on.

239
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,061
When Rupa lost her family
in an accident...

240
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,314
She said she thought about it.

241
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,317
I'm not on that level at all.

242
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:21,574
I've always wanted to do this.

243
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,368
Okay, smile!

244
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,245
Momoka, Tomo, smile a bit more please.

245
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:29,123
Okay. Say cheese, please.

246
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,044
We're like idols.

247
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,337
Shut up.

248
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:38,341
WELCOME TO THE LAND OF SUWA
FIREWORKS FESTIVAL

249
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,345
I know we're on a budget, but this is...

250
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:43,846
It's so hot.

251
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,224
So heavy.

252
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,727
Good morning.

253
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,981
Good morning.

254
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,274
Girls Band Cry.

255
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,987
SUWA FIREWORKS SHOW
PREVIOUS-PREVIOUS-PREVIOUS NIGHT FESTIVAL

256
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,242
That went well.

257
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,326
How?!

258
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,785
We weren't in sync!

259
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,789
What? You two are behind!

260
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,708
That's not possible!

261
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,418
You're both off.

262
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,421
More importantly, Subaru,
your neck is bent.

263
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,423
I know! I slept on it funny!

264
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,592
So this is your new band, Momo?

265
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,552
"Momo"?

266
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,553
Yes!

267
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,554
"Yes"?

268
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:25,804
Oh. My neck's fixed.

269
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:29,434
I won't say you're good,
but I don't hate it.

270
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,811
Better than being just a little good.

271
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,231
Sorry, we'll do our best
not to embarrass you.

272
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,567
Oh. That guitar...

273
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,694
Yeah, it's still the same one.

274
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,196
It still has the sticker you gave me. See?

275
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:48,870
She seems like
a completely different person.

276
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:53,708
I'm sure that's close to
how she used to be.

277
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,711
I want to play one song together
at the end.

278
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:57,670
Is that okay?

279
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:58,755
Are you sure?

280
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,881
You're okay with us?

281
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,259
I invited you because
I wanted to play with you.

282
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,386
So, are you guys in too?

283
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,639
What? O-Oh, yes.

284
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,934
Are you guys up for a jam session?

285
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,771
- Jam session?
- Basically to sing together.

286
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,273
You're the vocalist, right?

287
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,232
Yes.

288
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:24,280
Goodbye the melody of yesterday

289
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:29,035
Until we can meet again

290
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,788
We're growing up

291
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,040
Once more

292
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:38,669
Even if we've forgotten

293
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,047
- So?
- What?

294
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,924
- Can you sing it?
- Oh, yes.

295
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,425
Probably.

296
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:45,802
I'll do my best.

297
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,222
Okay, it's decided then.
I'll tell the owner.

298
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,893
- It's a good song, right?
- Yes!

299
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:59,315
When I moved to Tokyo,
I saw Mine's show and thought to myself...

300
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,653
She was like a bonus to the opening act.

301
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:08,157
But she stood firm
and fought with her song.

302
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,536
It was so rock and roll.

303
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,289
It's perfect for my last show.

304
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,337
I'm going to quit this band.

305
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,423
Tomorrow's show will be my last.

306
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,674
Then I'm out.

307
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,135
What are you talking about?

308
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:32,598
Sorry, but I don't feel like
I can carry this band to go pro.

309
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,808
Why not?

310
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:37,979
Because the songs I make
won't work on a professional level.

311
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:42,817
I'm happy that you like my songs.

312
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,945
And I'm grateful
that you've taken this seriously.

313
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,113
Thank you.

314
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,489
You're fine with that?

315
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,490
Yeah.

316
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,245
I'm fine with that.

317
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:57,748
NICHOME

318
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,544
Who knew you'd become such
a heavy drinker!

319
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,009
And you can hold your liquor, Rupa.

320
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,720
She loves drinking people under the table.

321
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,763
Do we have to carry her again?

322
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,600
She may not look it, but Momoka is heavy!

323
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,811
You'd better do the show
properly tomorrow.

324
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,189
You have to pay the audience respect.

325
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,565
I know that.

326
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,025
What's with the scary looks?

327
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,028
Are you guys fighting?

328
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:34,160
More importantly,
what kind of music do you like, Mine?

329
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,663
Have you ever thought about
quitting music before?

330
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,082
Where is this coming from?

331
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,834
You're being annoying.

332
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,880
She must not like coming to a conclusion.

333
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,843
The longer you do something,
the clearer the results become.

334
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,764
If it didn't go well the first time,
you can chalk it up to bad luck.

335
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:58,684
But a second time
may point to a lack of talent.

336
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,813
Can't she believe that it will go well?

337
00:17:05,523 --> 00:17:07,276
I'm sure she wants to.

338
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:11,821
But if you have faith, it cuts
even deeper when it doesn't work out.

339
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,241
She's scared.

340
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,535
Because she truly loves music.

341
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,457
See you tomorrow.

342
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:25,211
Um...

343
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,799
are you not scared?

344
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:31,050
Me?

345
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,218
Yes.

346
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:36,931
Of course, I'm scared.

347
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:40,476
Even now, there are times
when I lose sleep or my appetite.

348
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:41,686
Still?

349
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:47,608
Of course, but that's what happens
when you do something you love as a job.

350
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,777
I thought about it
when I was in music school.

351
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:53,155
To just become a teacher
and sing as a hobby.

352
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,868
That it would be the smartest path.

353
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,372
Why didn't you do that?

354
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:02,832
I wonder.

355
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,459
I forgot already.

356
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:06,877
You forgot?

357
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,967
Except, for me, the stage is
where I can say whatever I want.

358
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,427
I love it.

359
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,388
So it doesn't matter how scared I am
or how tough it is.

360
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,267
I bet that's what I thought.

361
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,896
Hey!

362
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,192
What the heck?! You stink of booze.

363
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,404
What are you talking about?
I didn't drink a drop!

364
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,656
How can you say such an obvious lie?

365
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,159
Geez, you're so annoying.

366
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,286
You're always, always, always...

367
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,413
- Bye.
- Always!

368
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,667
Hey! Are you listening to me?

369
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,462
Take care of Momoka for me!

370
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,006
Hey! What are we supposed to do?

371
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,009
Nina! That's so unfair!

372
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:59,138
Excuse me, which way is the lake?

373
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,641
Thank you!

374
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,449
I've decided!

375
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:20,034
I've decided!

376
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:23,996
I've decided!

377
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,801
I've decided.

378
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,307
SUWA FIREWORKS SHOW
PREVIOUS-PREVIOUS-PREVIOUS NIGHT FESTIVAL

379
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:44,767
Thank you.

380
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,311
I really like this next group,
so please hear them out.

381
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,316
Ready?

382
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:53,567
Yeah.

383
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,071
So the band name?

384
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,321
Has it been decided?

385
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:01,784
We were going to decide while we ate,
but we still haven't...

386
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:06,080
Shinkawasaki is... well, whatever.

387
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,208
Huh?

388
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,459
Good evening!

389
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,502
- We are...
- What?!

390
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:12,461
Seriously?

391
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:14,630
Um...

392
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,347
TOGEARI TOGENASHI
TOGE TOGE

393
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,684
Togenashi Togeari!

394
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,855
That's the same as my T-shirt!

395
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,232
Wow, what a coincidence.

396
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:39,864
Hello, I suddenly found myself
joining a band this spring.

397
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:45,411
I didn't know why I did,
or why I was singing at all.

398
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,496
But it was fun.

399
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:51,250
For the first time in my life,
I got sucked into something.

400
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:54,170
Come on, hurry.

401
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,008
There's a song
that completely changed my life.

402
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,762
This song really helped push me forward.

403
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:08,017
That's why I want to prove to everyone
that the song isn't wrong!

404
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,352
I want to move people with that song,

405
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,022
and brag about how awesome it is.

406
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:17,401
With Subaru, Rupa, Tomo, and Momoka.

407
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,154
I'm sure they all feel the same.

408
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,865
So we're seriously working hard.

409
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,826
We're scared,
but we believe and we work hard.

410
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:27,994
Which is why I...

411
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,538
I...

412
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:32,792
It's annoying...

413
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:35,920
to keep talking about yourself.

414
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,046
Sorry.

415
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,592
Seriously?

416
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,011
What kind of messy start is this?

417
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:45,679
Whatever!

418
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:53,103
I'm always full of scars
My body and mind are fragmented

419
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:58,651
Passion is heartless
It's all tattered inside my heart

420
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:13,582
I plunge into the city
Where it's full of lies, it makes me sick

421
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:18,420
Within the stench and the noise
I cry out alone

422
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:21,340
Nothing is happening
How was it today?

423
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,884
Don't say meaningless things all the time

424
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:29,723
That creepy voice echoes in my mind
While I can't stop crying

425
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,268
"You don't have to be afraid
So stop hiding

426
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,811
Come and dance with me," you said

427
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:38,190
I want to get away from this putrid world

428
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:39,775
Disperse right now

429
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,528
Disperse, disperse, quietly

430
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,780
Quietly, don't let me be alone

431
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:49,243
Like sorrow laid out in the bars of a song

432
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,705
Forever and ever and ever

433
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,165
Until love can be proven

434
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:59,378
I don't want to believe
That love is an emotion

435
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:03,132
I could go insane

436
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,743
Rupa.

437
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,494
Tomo.

438
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,496
Subaru.

439
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:36,665
Momoka.

440
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:38,876
I...

441
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,587
I'm quitting cram school.

442
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,090
Oh boy.

443
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,928
Next time, "If You Were to Cry"
