1
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:20,687
What a nice breeze.

2
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,402
Momoka, I...

3
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:32,031
This unfinished beat covers the night

4
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,909
Embracing us before we're crushed

5
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:39,623
Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand

6
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,459
There will be change
If you just reach out

7
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:52,219
Crying in a crowd with a voiceless voice

8
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:56,473
Come morning
The footsteps drown out the voice

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,602
No matter how much time passes
It never dries

10
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:05,190
The cold, muddy waters of a decaying city

11
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:06,691
In a world where nothing changes

12
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,528
We have to live through it

13
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,822
It may be dumb, but we have no choice

14
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,575
We've already started walking

15
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,745
It may seem unreal
It may seem stupid

16
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,540
This hopeless city of ours

17
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,834
But I still saw it with my own eyes

18
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,712
I touched it with these hands
See? See?

19
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:30,007
See? There it goes again
It's so stupid

20
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,843
Shine a light through
The hopeless darkness

21
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,012
This isn't a dream
Even in a dead city

22
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:38,056
Giving up won't change anything
Even now, now

23
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:41,560
Now, this unfinished beat covers the night

24
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,396
Embracing us before we're crushed

25
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:49,151
Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand

26
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,820
There will be change
If you just reach out

27
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,372
So close!

28
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,999
You're so close!

29
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,876
Deal with it.

30
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,339
Why did we end up here anyway?

31
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,883
The other rooms were full.

32
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,887
The studio we used before was empty.

33
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:18,889
That room's expensive.

34
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,514
Are we going to be okay?

35
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:22,392
The festival is coming up.

36
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,188
"Are we going to be okay?"

37
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,398
"The festival is coming up."

38
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,111
We're wasting time.

39
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,405
Are you okay with that part?

40
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,367
Should I just jump in where you said?

41
00:02:38,532 --> 00:02:39,618
Want me to time you in?

42
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,536
Thanks.

43
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,246
Do we need the last part?

44
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,831
I thought the same.

45
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,917
I prefer the way it is now.

46
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,169
I think they both work,
but let's ask Momoka.

47
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:51,672
What do you think?

48
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,467
It might feel noisy
because we're all playing at once.

49
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,929
Let's try it where I don't play.

50
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:00,680
From the last chorus.

51
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:02,683
Okay!

52
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,102
I'm so tired.

53
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,230
Oh, Burton Sister is the closing act!

54
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,272
No way!

55
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,690
You like them?

56
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,359
N-No.

57
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,444
They're hot, right?

58
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,071
I said I'm not a fan!

59
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,657
Look, we're on it too!

60
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,076
Well, obviously. We're performing.

61
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,286
The first day, right?

62
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,580
Yes, the first ones on this stage.

63
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,583
So we can go see the closing act.

64
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,502
And this one and this one and...

65
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,671
Are you really going to see them all?

66
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,589
Of course I will.

67
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,591
We're getting in for free after all.

68
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,428
How many people will be there?

69
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,097
The festival goes long, so it'll vary.

70
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,891
It'll be full during the main acts,

71
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,102
but not so much with side acts.

72
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,605
And we need to try to leave our mark?

73
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:53,775
Actually...

74
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,110
Hey!

75
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:59,614
I heard you guys are playing
a different time at the festival!

76
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,366
I'm rooting for you!

77
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,579
We might be playing the second day.

78
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:06,371
What?

79
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,833
One of the bands had to drop out.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,588
We'll be playing the same stage, but
they asked if we'd take their time slot.

81
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,632
The second day lasts all night.

82
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,886
There'll be way more people there
than our current slot.

83
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,345
That's amazing!

84
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,389
So you're all good with it?

85
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,894
Does this mean things are going our way?

86
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,984
Do you guys have time right now?

87
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,654
This is...

88
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,613
Yeah.

89
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,659
I figured we should scope out
the stage while we can.

90
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,952
We really get to play somewhere this big?

91
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,456
Unfortunately, that's the main stage.

92
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:50,207
Main?

93
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,960
We play on the small stage
they made over there.

94
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,213
What? There are multiple stages?

95
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,839
You really don't know anything.

96
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,384
Popular bands play the big stages.

97
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,845
Bands like us play small ones.

98
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,848
Diamond Dust plays
on the big stage, of course.

99
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,355
I'm happy.

100
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,857
It's kind of cool.

101
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,863
We're challenging Diamond Dust
on the main stage from the small stage.

102
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:23,532
Like giant-killing.

103
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,116
Even a cornered rat will bite a cat.

104
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,159
Hold on.

105
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,870
They don't see it like that,
neither do the fans.

106
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:30,914
Well, we do.

107
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,541
Momoka and I.

108
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,044
You're really okay
about our new time slot?

109
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:38,588
It's okay, right?

110
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:42,884
Okay.

111
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:47,472
It's going to feel great
playing under these stars.

112
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,892
Momoka!

113
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,895
Please lend me a guitar for the festival!

114
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,773
I'm off to work then!

115
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,026
Huh? You're not going too?

116
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:05,282
No, Nina started a second job on her own.

117
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,283
What?

118
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,536
Call her selfish or just fickle.

119
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:13,039
She decided she was going to
make it on her own.

120
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,543
She has changed recently, hasn't she?

121
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,296
Can she actually play the guitar now?

122
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,297
No idea.

123
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,052
Come on.

124
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,055
Must be nice to work out your issues.

125
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,016
Damn it.

126
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,561
LIAR

127
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,065
I'm not a liar.

128
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:49,826
Subaru's still hiding the fact
that she's in a band, right?

129
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,829
I like that about you.

130
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,457
I-I don't care or anything.

131
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:59,002
I hope you can forgive them, one day.

132
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,088
That's not happening.

133
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,841
You never know what the future holds.

134
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:06,593
There's no way.

135
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,721
But they're still in reach.

136
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:16,519
Even if you never meet or talk,
they're still alive.

137
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:22,484
The people I cared about are now ash,
nowhere to be found.

138
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,528
You still have me.

139
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,490
Thank you.

140
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,118
What? Why do I sing?

141
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,623
Maybe it's because
it lets me connect to someone else.

142
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,625
Hmm.

143
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,879
Maybe it's because
it's where I can be honest.

144
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,882
Yeah.

145
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,885
Because I can forget everything
and just be free.

146
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,060
For me...

147
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,356
it's because I want to feel like
I'm not wrong.

148
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,402
There are so many people.

149
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,279
Things are about to get into full swing.

150
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,364
You are...?

151
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,699
Oh, we're Toge Toge.

152
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,158
Togenashi Togeari.

153
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,910
Ah, yes.

154
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,537
You can get off here.

155
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,957
We play in the evening?

156
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,917
Yeah. Don't be late.

157
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,712
We might have time to see other bands.

158
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,922
But today's our big day.

159
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:30,051
I mean, checking out other bands
could fire us up.

160
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,261
Just don't be late.

161
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,304
You got it!

162
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,931
Can I come with you?

163
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,183
Nope, not you Nina!

164
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:38,684
Meanie!

165
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,188
This is our space.

166
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,231
Yeah.

167
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,857
Yo!

168
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,360
You came!

169
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,695
Mine!

170
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,740
- Is this a good time?
- Yeah.

171
00:08:51,905 --> 00:08:53,116
Good to see you again.

172
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,451
Hi.

173
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,785
Long time no see.

174
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,871
You could've told me you were coming.

175
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,956
Where's the fun in that?

176
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:04,002
Anyway, playing this slot
on the second day is a big deal!

177
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,129
Thank you.

178
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,423
It was mostly luck though.

179
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,342
How've you been, Nina?

180
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,261
Good, but I'm still learning the guitar.

181
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:16,973
Good.

182
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,268
You look like you're settling in.

183
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,394
Really?

184
00:09:21,977 --> 00:09:23,813
You have the look of a singer.

185
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,064
Thank you.

186
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,027
How long are you gonna talk?

187
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,654
Introduce me already.

188
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,530
Yo!

189
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,284
We're under attack!

190
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,994
Oh, sorry.

191
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,287
This is Kyoko.

192
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,790
It's a small world, huh?

193
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,374
Hello.

194
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,458
Hi.

195
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,545
Kyoko here is a fan of yours, Nina.

196
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,591
I love your voice.

197
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,803
Come play with us again sometime, yeah?

198
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,304
I-If you'll have me.

199
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,058
Really? That's awesome!

200
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,811
Let's take a picture.

201
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,437
Can you make a funny face?

202
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,064
F-Funny face?

203
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,066
Come on, you guys, too!

204
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,317
What... Why?

205
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,527
Ready?

206
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,570
Say cheese!

207
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,907
Your faces are hilarious.

208
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:19,535
I can't believe you and Rupa backed out!

209
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,914
We got a lot of likes.

210
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,207
And comments too.

211
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,501
They're looking forward to seeing us.

212
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,503
We're getting attention!

213
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,506
It's all we can drink!

214
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,133
I'm jealous.

215
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,884
Down the hatch!

216
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:35,885
Stop!

217
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,386
Just a little?

218
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,806
Your "little" is never just a little.

219
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,475
Ms. Miura!

220
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,646
You're Ms. Miura, aren't you?

221
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,773
Y-You have the wrong person!

222
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,150
What? Wrong person?

223
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,444
- Down the hatch!
- No!

224
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,157
Hey, Subaru hasn't made it back yet.

225
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,659
She's probably still checking out bands.

226
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,412
So unfair. I wanted to go with her.

227
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:05,039
She was already back in the dressing room.

228
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,124
Really?

229
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,625
No!

230
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,044
Subaru.

231
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,045
Yo!

232
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,631
Did you get to check out
some performances?

233
00:11:14,756 --> 00:11:15,174
Yep!

234
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,678
I'm so jealous. I wanted to go too.

235
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,763
I bet you're jealous.

236
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,933
Must be nice to have closure.

237
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:25,934
What is it?

238
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,397
The first time I went to a music festival,

239
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:32,150
one of the drummers said something.

240
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:35,945
How they always do their best to play,
watching the other members' backs.

241
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,532
That really resonated with me.

242
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,202
I'm in the exact same position.

243
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,203
Subaru.

244
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,956
I texted my grandma yesterday.

245
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,708
Texted her what?

246
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:49,918
What?

247
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:53,713
That I wanted to do something
other than act.

248
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:54,964
Really?

249
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,843
So let's keep this band going.

250
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,803
Even if it doesn't work out today.

251
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:02,804
Are you sure?

252
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:07,936
You're narrow-minded and stubborn
and you preach morals.

253
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,772
Yet you're shy and unfriendly.

254
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,649
No wonder you got bullied.

255
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,193
But you don't lie.

256
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,113
Plus, you give everything your all,
and that's reassuring.

257
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,658
It makes me want to stick with you.

258
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,534
Thanks.

259
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,285
I'm lying though.

260
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,288
You liar.

261
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,417
Let's go.

262
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,336
Momoka.

263
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:34,671
Go where?

264
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,839
Follow me and find out.

265
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,551
It's huge.

266
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,720
It's the main stage after all.

267
00:12:42,886 --> 00:12:44,304
The crowd's getting bigger.

268
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,974
Can you see, Tomo?

269
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,226
That's why I hate these.

270
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,061
Want to get on my shoulders?

271
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:55,817
Looks like you've gotten used to
doing that naturally.

272
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:57,735
They started.

273
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,779
This song...

274
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,323
Yeah, that's right.

275
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,158
Momoka.

276
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,831
Thank you for inviting us here!

277
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,333
And to all you first-timers, we are...

278
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,628
Diamond Dust!

279
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,841
Please stay until the end!

280
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,847
How long are you planning on
playing the tragic heroine?

281
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,890
You were in the wrong.

282
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,355
Keep it up and you'll just hurt yourself.

283
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,982
You must be stupid.

284
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,528
Shut up.

285
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,913
Let's go!

286
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:20,777
At the end of this world
That heralds the beginning

287
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:24,197
Only the suspicious looms

288
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:29,243
My boredom continues to accelerate

289
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:34,415
Living inside a dream that cannot end

290
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,918
We laugh, surrounded by enemies

291
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:42,090
I want to go crazy
To match your eerie gaze

292
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,717
But that won't be enough

293
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:49,889
Those who haven't screamed enough
Enjoy the results of others' past efforts

294
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:55,144
A single wish for those who change

295
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,688
I will continue to scream over and over

296
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:04,612
Wrapped in the chains of cruel fate

297
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,241
A different cycle of sorrow

298
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,882
Thank you!

299
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,262
- Welcome!
- We can see you in the back there!

300
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,514
They've gotten better.

301
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:32,515
True.

302
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:38,521
They got slammed for being over-produced
after they got an idol as their vocalist.

303
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:45,027
I know they're thinking, "Don't mock us.
I'll change your mind about us right now."

304
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,283
The fans got the message.

305
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,034
They're serious.

306
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,128
So they're game too, huh?

307
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,254
Now I'm pissed off.

308
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,214
I love this type of thing.

309
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:10,303
All right everyone,
let's steal all their fans here.

310
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:11,971
Yeah.

311
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:16,350
Can we get Togenashi Togeari
to do a sound check?

312
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,310
Okay.

313
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,356
Wow.

314
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,612
Can we start with the drums?

315
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:28,779
Okay.

316
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,473
Okay, we're good.

317
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,558
Can you test your mic?

318
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,601
Okay.

319
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,315
Thank you.

320
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:05,608
Thank you!

321
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,234
Can't wait for today!

322
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,821
Okay, can we get the bass next?

323
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,240
Okay.

324
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:32,885
Okay.

325
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,595
Do you use other tones?

326
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,430
Yes, I use distortion.

327
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,776
Okay, any others?

328
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,194
Nope!

329
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,407
We're almost up.

330
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,075
Then a little pick-me-up!

331
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,660
No booze!

332
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:00,162
Oh. Where's Ms. Miura by the way?

333
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,749
She texted me earlier
saying she's in the crowd watching us.

334
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,167
She's not coming to say hi?

335
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,671
I prefer the distance.
It makes her seem more trustworthy.

336
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,840
You think that's it?

337
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,175
Togenashi Togeari!

338
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,386
We're ready for you on stage!

339
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:16,429
Okay.

340
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,473
Want to huddle up or something?

341
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,433
No way.

342
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,811
Our pinkies...
What about putting our pinkies up?

343
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,314
Yeah!

344
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:28,566
Yeah.

345
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,319
Lame.

346
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,656
We're about to start
the most important show of our lives.

347
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:40,411
Let us all hear you sing and shout
on that stage, Nina.

348
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,664
Go hit that crowd
in the emotions with our song.

349
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,375
Okay.

350
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,544
Look! You made her cry!

351
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,796
We're about to take the stage!

352
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,307
I can't play the guitar!

353
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,270
You're crazy.

354
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,229
You suck.

355
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,981
So rock and roll.

356
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,525
Um, nice to meet you.

357
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,194
We're Togenashi Togeari.

358
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,196
We're in a band.

359
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,700
Um, but it's not easy at all.

360
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,702
We're all timid

361
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,497
and distrusting of others
and always grumbling.

362
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,500
We invite others
then end up not giving it our all.

363
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,752
You talking about me?

364
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,796
What do you mean grumbling?

365
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,589
I mean, we are!

366
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:34,632
That's enough.

367
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,885
That was Momoka on the guitar,
and Tomo on the keyboard!

368
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,595
And our Morality Monster,

369
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,472
Nina on vocals!

370
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,974
And Rupa on bass!

371
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,726
I love fighting!

372
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,021
And on the drums...

373
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,773
I'm Subaru!

374
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:56,028
"Give up. It'll never happen."

375
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,948
"You can't do it. Just face reality."

376
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,449
"This is enough."

377
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,785
"It's hard for me too."

378
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:08,791
Reality tries to swallow
and undermine me with a kind expression.

379
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,295
So I'm putting it all on this song.

380
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,172
And...

381
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,676
turn the nonbelievers
into believers with this song.

382
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,179
To all the people who rejected all of me.

383
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,182
I'll scream to them that I wasn't wrong!

384
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,310
No matter how much I get

385
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:33,148
No matter how much I make it my own
My own, my own

386
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:39,696
I can never catch up

387
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:50,249
To tell someone they're shooting too high
Is a rotten thing to do

388
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:55,921
Nobody wants others to be better than them

389
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,008
The reason is simple

390
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:04,680
They want to break through this emptiness

391
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:10,644
By the time you see it with a pure heart

392
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:15,733
You assume everything will look rosy

393
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,863
Even what you want to grasp
Begins to look blurry

394
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,491
I don't want to die
I live life hard

395
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,160
I want it, I want it
My soul screams

396
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:31,248
Irrational irritation can't be stopped

397
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,751
Unforgivable, unforgivable
It's so pathetic

398
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,962
Everything, everything
It's all worse

399
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:42,676
You just can't see the tears I'm hiding

400
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:57,191
To tell someone to be obedient
Is a nasty thing to do

401
00:21:57,358 --> 00:22:03,030
Insubordination is a form of admiration

402
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,075
Sad and alone

403
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:12,205
The pain of having nowhere to go
I kicked it off

404
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:17,711
Unable to cry with an empty heart

405
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:22,840
Suppressing my flame, my voice silent

406
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:28,013
Everything I want to do
Going up in smoke, becoming faint

407
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:51,412
Even what you want to grasp
Begins to look blurry

408
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,505
I don't want to disappear
I want it destroyed

409
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:04,174
The rusted and tangled
Distorted commotion

410
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:09,305
The muddy transparency can be pretty
If pulverized into powder

411
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,932
So pathetic, so pathetic
I can't stand it

412
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,977
Faint significance, breathing stopped
Ideals are old fantasies

413
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:22,109
Scared to even try to resist

414
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:30,200
Scared to...

415
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,372
EMPTINESS AND CATHARSIS

416
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,129
Momoka.

417
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,424
I wasn't wrong, was I?

418
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,429
