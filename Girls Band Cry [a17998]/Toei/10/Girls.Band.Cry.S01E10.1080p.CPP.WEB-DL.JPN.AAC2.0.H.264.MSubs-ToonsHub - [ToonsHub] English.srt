1
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,640
Are we even popular?

2
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,808
Plus our merch is cute.

3
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,770
It's your fault for giving us
a weird name.

4
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,646
Is it?

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,691
We have Toge-Toge rubber bands!

6
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,944
How about a Toge-Toge towel?

7
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,490
I think it's selling better than
when we were Shinkawasaki.

8
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:32,574
Really?

9
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:36,328
Don't worry, the Polaroids
are still a hit.

10
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,205
Ready?

11
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,498
Hug!

12
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,335
I'll never bathe again!

13
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,671
Gross! Start by cleaning that brain!

14
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:46,838
True.

15
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,423
Not interested.

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,218
Excuse me.

17
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:56,098
This is my card.

18
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:59,101
Golden Archer?

19
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:02,229
- Yes.
- That sounds familiar.

20
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,232
Oh! The talent agency!

21
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:09,944
Yes!

22
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:13,072
This unfinished beat covers the night

23
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,950
Embracing us before we're crushed

24
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:20,664
Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand

25
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,500
There will be change
If you just reach out

26
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:33,260
Crying in a crowd with a voiceless voice

27
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:37,514
Come morning
The footsteps drown out the voice

28
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:41,643
No matter how much time passes
It never dries

29
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,231
The cold, muddy waters of a decaying city

30
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,733
In a world where nothing changes

31
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,569
We have to live through it

32
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,864
It may be dumb, but we have no choice

33
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,617
We've already started walking

34
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,786
It may seem unreal
It may seem stupid

35
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,581
This hopeless city of ours

36
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,875
But I still saw it with my own eyes

37
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,753
I touched it with these hands
See? See?

38
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,048
See? There it goes again
It's so stupid

39
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,883
Shine a light through
The hopeless darkness

40
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,053
This isn't a dream
Even in a dead city

41
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:19,097
Giving up won't change anything
Even now, now

42
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,601
Now, this unfinished beat covers the night

43
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:25,437
Embracing us before we're crushed

44
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:30,192
Even if your hand is unreliable
That is your own hand

45
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,861
There will be change
If you just reach out

46
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,662
Are you scouting us?

47
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,415
Yes, that's my intention.

48
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:46,917
I see.

49
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,922
If you have doubts, please search online
for our company and my name Miura.

50
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,508
- What are they like?
- Pretty famous.

51
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,386
I have classmates who want to join them,

52
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,304
and they have a few bands signed.

53
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,806
But aren't talent agencies...

54
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:05,185
I'm actually a fan of Diamond Dust!

55
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,523
But I don't like the current Diamond Dust!

56
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,068
They've lost what made
the original band so good.

57
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,612
I love your music, Momoka!

58
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:19,282
I want you to actualize
the kind of music you originally pursued.

59
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,410
And this band can do that!

60
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,369
Right?!

61
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:24,496
Sit down.

62
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:25,455
Sorry.

63
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,667
When D-D wanted to go mainstream,

64
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:33,964
I was told that my songs won't work
and that they didn't match the trend.

65
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,215
Yes.

66
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,884
I don't think they were wrong about that.

67
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,472
And the fans followed D-D
when they adopted their new sound.

68
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:47,477
But these four here
still want to go up against them.

69
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,480
They want to give it a shot
with the music I want to write.

70
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,483
And I'm planning on doing just that.

71
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:55,485
Right?

72
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,487
Momoka...

73
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:58,989
Okay.

74
00:03:59,156 --> 00:03:59,990
What?

75
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,034
You're entering
the upcoming music festival, yes?

76
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,496
"Leave your mark at the festival," huh?

77
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:11,918
If we stand out there, it'll be easier
for the agency to get labels on board.

78
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:17,089
And if we have a lot of fans,
we won't need to change our music style.

79
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:21,887
So the festival is like
our final audition.

80
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,889
- Nina.
- Yes?

81
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:27,934
Would you mind
writing lyrics for that song?

82
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:28,935
What?

83
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:34,065
I want to see the song my music inspired.

84
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,067
Okay.

85
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,320
That makes no sense.

86
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,071
What are you saying?

87
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,781
Sounds fine to me.

88
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,117
They seem to understand each other.

89
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,830
Did you finish the lyrics?

90
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,123
Nope.

91
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,502
Didn't you say you had something
you wanted to write about?

92
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,086
I did.

93
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,422
Then just write that.

94
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:58,964
You don't get it...

95
00:04:59,132 --> 00:04:59,966
What?

96
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,803
Words are outside.

97
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,553
Once you put it into words,

98
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:08,725
what you had inside gets out
and takes shape.

99
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,894
Who do you think you're talking to?!

100
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,897
Do you know how many songs I've written?

101
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,232
Ow...

102
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,151
I get what you're saying though.

103
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,487
Come on, break's over.

104
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,363
Already?

105
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:27,952
What?

106
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,162
Nothing.

107
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,543
Hello...

108
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,505
What is it?

109
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,758
Why? How?

110
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,135
What are...

111
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,013
Hello.

112
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,098
Excuse me.

113
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:52,142
I believe you have a girl named
Iseri working here part-time.

114
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:57,399
She's not on schedule today.

115
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,278
I see.

116
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,196
Are you looking for her?

117
00:06:04,488 --> 00:06:06,283
You must be Rupa.

118
00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:12,289
Tell me sooner if you knew!

119
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:17,669
Da...

120
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,425
Nina?

121
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,177
So that's why you came here?

122
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:30,181
It's so relaxing here.

123
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,726
You don't even know why they're here.

124
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,312
Shouldn't you talk to them?

125
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,605
Are you listening?

126
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,815
Mm...

127
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:41,818
Nina?

128
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,112
We can't understand each other.

129
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,071
What?

130
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,241
It's the same with your grandma.

131
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,535
We have different values.

132
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,079
All they say is nonsense.

133
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:54,831
But still...

134
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,084
Besides, I need to write lyrics.

135
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,545
We don't have much time
before the festival.

136
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,505
Everyone's future is on the line.

137
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,091
I don't have time to deal with this.

138
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,428
Sounds to me like you're running away.

139
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,475
Do you want to stay over tonight?

140
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,104
NEXT MORNING

141
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,023
Hello?

142
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,525
Stop calling.

143
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,235
You're the one who ran away.

144
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,571
It wasn't like that.

145
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:31,159
They keep calling me
asking where you might be.

146
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,286
Have you told to them?

147
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,039
It's because you sent a letter like this.

148
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,625
Of course they wouldn't leave you alone.

149
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,293
Why?

150
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,712
Did you think they'd just accept it?

151
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:47,258
If you have something to say,
stop running and tell it to their face.

152
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,011
Nina?

153
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:51,513
She hung up.

154
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,270
Huh?

155
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,815
They changed the locks?

156
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,901
I'm the one who lives there!

157
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,153
Give me the new key!

158
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:13,243
What is wrong with everyone?!

159
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,244
Shut up!

160
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:15,286
But!

161
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,038
Here you go!

162
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:21,543
I took you off the schedule.

163
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,546
It's a present from me and Tomo.

164
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:28,717
Why?

165
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,929
I think Tomo might have mentioned it,

166
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,850
but I was supposed to
call my family that day.

167
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,602
My shift went long,

168
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:44,441
so I figured I'd call them
the next day or some other time.

169
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,027
But that was the last time.

170
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:52,365
You have less time
and opportunities than you think.

171
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,577
Sorry, I know it's annoying
to just talk about myself.

172
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,956
Do they really care?

173
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,708
They used to just ignore me.

174
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,713
Don't add sound effects.

175
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,298
I see.

176
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,341
So this was your weakness.

177
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,969
It's not a weakness or anything.

178
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,304
Then go do it already.

179
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,931
Not you too!

180
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,726
Well, it seems like
you're misunderstanding.

181
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,352
What?!

182
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,189
The thing you can't let go

183
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,732
isn't your exams or the bullying.

184
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,862
It's that your dad didn't take your side.

185
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:33,865
That's not...

186
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,159
If it's not true, then go meet them.

187
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,869
I will then.

188
00:09:38,535 --> 00:09:39,703
Then go.

189
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,123
You're not welcome back here until you do.

190
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:45,752
Bye then.

191
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:55,761
I actually came.

192
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,516
The train bound towards
Suizenji and Hikarinomori will be...

193
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,022
Okay!

194
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,650
Ready, and...

195
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:20,953
Ow!

196
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:22,789
Geez...

197
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:30,713
Nina.

198
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,135
We've been looking for you.

199
00:10:38,011 --> 00:10:39,514
Girls Band Cry.

200
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,058
A band?

201
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,559
Yeah.

202
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,437
And you want to make a living from it?

203
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:47,814
Seems like it.

204
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,442
She's already been approached
by a talent agency.

205
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,487
She's like one step from going pro.

206
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,030
Not sure if it's true though.

207
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,201
- That's all true.
- But...

208
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,453
You left home to study for college,

209
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,874
and you did all this without
telling any of us?

210
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,835
I did hear about it a little bit.

211
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:12,130
Do you know how hurt your mother is?

212
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,969
This again.
Mom's got nothing to do with this.

213
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:23,641
When I left home, you told me
to do what I wanted, Dad.

214
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,852
And I told you I would.

215
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,021
No.

216
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,857
I told you to get into college.

217
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,321
How much do you think
we've let you get away with?

218
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,491
You wanted to drop out of school,
so we did the paperwork.

219
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,120
You wanted to go to Tokyo,
so we arranged it.

220
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,372
Stop making things up.

221
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,124
I did everything myself!

222
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,711
Dropping out and going to Tokyo!

223
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:55,423
You only got that apartment
with your mother's introduction.

224
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:59,510
Whose name is listed as your guarantor?

225
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:04,599
You're still a minor.
Do you know what that means?

226
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:08,436
It means you have an adult
looking after you.

227
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,023
So I should do as you say?

228
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,526
Just act like I wasn't bullied?

229
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,487
Nina.

230
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,030
I can't do this after all.

231
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:25,245
I came here to try to talk to you properly
and get you to understand my side.

232
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,747
But this is how it starts.

233
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:28,957
I just can't.

234
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,962
I want you to come with me
somewhere tomorrow.

235
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:38,675
Hey.

236
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,260
Where are we going?

237
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,681
You'll find out soon enough.

238
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:14,711
I'm not going.

239
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,088
I'm not going back to that school.

240
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:18,965
I've already spoken to them.

241
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:24,303
I have something to say, just like you do.

242
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:28,766
Thank you for coming in this hot weather.

243
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:29,726
It's nothing.

244
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,352
What is this?

245
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,857
It must have been hot for you too.

246
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,942
- So...
- Yes.

247
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:42,947
We followed up and the other student
admitted the truth.

248
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:48,369
I want to apologize on behalf of
the school for our lack of awareness.

249
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:52,373
Is that all? Are you saying
the school wasn't responsible?

250
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,792
That is not the case.

251
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,254
However, the school
doesn't recognize it as bullying.

252
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:01,591
I know it's not my place to say this,

253
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,761
but I think the school
was aware of the truth...

254
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:05,761
Don't.

255
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,221
But...

256
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,348
I said stop already.

257
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:13,061
You don't need to say that.

258
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,104
You're the victim.

259
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,276
Momoka, it's about Nina.

260
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:24,781
What if she doesn't come back
from Kumamoto?

261
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,158
It'll work out.

262
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:29,660
Tomo!

263
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,412
Are you okay?

264
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,919
It'll be okay.

265
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,129
Let's believe in her.

266
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:42,548
Welcome home.

267
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,716
Thanks.

268
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,968
Will you have dinner?

269
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,064
- You're going back?
- Yeah.

270
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,942
So you're really doing the band?

271
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,568
Yeah.

272
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,822
You love it that much?

273
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:13,913
That song...

274
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,543
gave me the push I needed.

275
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,965
I was told the smart thing to do
was to hold it in.

276
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:28,469
So I thought that I didn't have
any other choice.

277
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,555
That song pushed me forward.

278
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,228
If I wasn't wrong,

279
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,730
then I don't need to hold it in.

280
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,066
I should stop thinking ahead

281
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,360
and just take a leap.

282
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,738
Now, I didn't know
if that led down to hell

283
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:51,242
or up towards the sky,

284
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,328
but that song made me fly.

285
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:58,291
So there's no ground to return to,
not that I want to go back.

286
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,042
Back then,

287
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:05,923
I was trying to
suppress the person I was.

288
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,015
I might not even have wings,

289
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:17,059
and I might just be imagining
that I'm flying,

290
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:21,481
but I love who I am now the most.

291
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,274
I can proudly say that.

292
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,194
This is the real me.

293
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,325
I understand.

294
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,369
But be sure to eat before you go.

295
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,705
Okay.

296
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,000
Here. Spicy lotus root curry.

297
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,418
It's been a while, right?

298
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,046
- Shouldn't we go down?
- What?

299
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,174
Our family precepts.

300
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,718
Oh. It's fine.

301
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:54,847
It's been weird since you left.

302
00:16:55,473 --> 00:17:00,186
Dad even had some beer the other day
even though he's not a drinker.

303
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,688
He got so drunk.

304
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,567
"What do you think I should do?"

305
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,736
- What?
- Can you believe it?

306
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,281
He's worried about you.

307
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,619
And despite being
a rather well-known educator,

308
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,455
he went around and asked for advice.

309
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:23,167
And your round-trip train ticket,

310
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:26,587
Mom secretly asked your friends
to give it to you.

311
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,714
You didn't realize, huh?

312
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,301
You're loved, you know?

313
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,098
Despite how they act,
our parents love you.

314
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,475
Don't forget that.

315
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,145
Thank you for the food.

316
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,607
Thank you for being alive.

317
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,527
I love you, too, Nina.

318
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:53,571
It's so spicy.

319
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,785
Was Mom's curry always this spicy?

320
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,880
NINA 10 YEARS OLD
SUZUNE 9 YEARS OLD

321
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,150
You like this song?

322
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:31,819
Yeah.

323
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,612
I see.

324
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:35,656
You don't like it?

325
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,657
Of course you don't.

326
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,829
It's a good song.

327
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,125
It's a good song.

328
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:48,753
Dad.

329
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:54,759
I'm sorry for being such a selfish
daughter who doesn't listen to you.

330
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,512
Try to cut down on the smoking.

331
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,900
Goodbye.

332
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,109
Goodbye!

333
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,320
Nina!

334
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,239
Wait.

335
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:19,241
What?

336
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,744
Is there something else?

337
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,165
Have a safe trip.

338
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:31,670
Yeah.

339
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,130
Nina!

340
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,425
Your apartment key!

341
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,219
Key?

342
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,515
Why?

343
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,141
It's from Dad.

344
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:55,861
Dad!

345
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,202
I'm going to sing a song I wrote
at our next show.

346
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,162
Please come hear it.

347
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,915
Okay.

348
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,417
Yes!

349
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,335
Nina.

350
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,882
I'm off then!

351
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,260
Thanks for cutting the branch!

352
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:21,929
Take care!

353
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,936
They're nosy, noisy, and irritating.

354
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,938
But I love them.

355
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,650
Bye, I'll see you again.

356
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,154
Thank you for riding with us.

357
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,406
Passengers changing to
the Chuo Line, Yamanote Line...

358
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,659
EMPTINESS AND CATHARSIS

359
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,703
Miss? Miss!

360
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:46,662
Yes!

361
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,873
Oh! You again!

362
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,916
Did you sleep well?

363
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:51,959
Yes!

364
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,138
I'm back.

365
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,651
Nina.

366
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,657
Where's our souvenir?

367
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,578
No way.

368
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:29,663
How?

369
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:34,627
Momoka was so sure that you'd come back.

370
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,712
If you didn't come back today,

371
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:40,090
she was going to drive us all to Kumamoto.

372
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:44,011
She said she'd even drive us herself.

373
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,388
Rupa was about to be our hero.

374
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,683
You were all for it too!

375
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,477
Wait, she's crying.

376
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,354
Does that count as crying?

377
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,481
What? She's not crying.

378
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,148
What do you think, Rupa?

379
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,944
Hmm, maybe.

380
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,405
Thanks, you guys.

381
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,164
I'm home!

382
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,667
Welcome home.

383
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,378
Did you get it done?

384
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,464
Yes, I wrote a great song!

385
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,718
Never influenced by anybody
Never becoming anybody

386
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:27,721
I laughed, thinking it a dream

387
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,808
Numbed by the weakness I had forgotten

388
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:33,811
I can't even say that I'm lonely

389
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:39,483
This fragile heart
Vulnerable to even casual conversation

390
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:45,614
Is incapable of making anyone happy

391
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:52,871
But still, I feel a growing hope

392
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:58,836
Moving past all of the lies

393
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:02,256
I just want to hear
That I'm not wrong

394
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:05,384
I'm a dreamer, I'm young

395
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:09,013
I don't care if I'm still the same today

396
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,599
I just want to sing with you

397
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,977
My emotions stir so often

398
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:18,147
I've been hated

399
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:21,483
But I'm going to keep walking

400
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:27,656
Proud of myself
Who can never become anybody

401
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,868
Even if I'm alone

402
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:34,330
I believe in myself

403
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:41,337
Every time I get hurt, I just need to sing

404
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,346
