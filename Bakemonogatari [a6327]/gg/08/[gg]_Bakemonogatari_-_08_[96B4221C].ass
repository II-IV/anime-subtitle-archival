Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.57,0:07:56.37,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It's not like a lizard's tail or something.  There's no way it'd be that convenient.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.37,0:08:02.33,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Paying just an arm to settle this is a very cheap price.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.87,0:08:07.46,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Say what you like, but that'd be pretty inconvenient for me.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:41.72,0:08:44.75,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Don't you think it's strange, Araragi-kun?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:44.75,0:08:53.09,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Rather than make her faster, why do you think that left hand beat up those around her when she was in elementary school?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.33,0:08:59.78,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Well, doesn't the Monkey's Paw fulfill wishes in a way its owner doesn't intend?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:00.60,0:09:02.35,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But it's not the Monkey's Paw.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.35,0:09:07.53,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,A Rainy Devil is a lesser devil, but a contract is still a contract.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.53,0:09:12.61,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,If she wished to be faster, it'd normally just make her faster.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:13.00,0:09:16.49,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Does beating down her classmates make her faster?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.74,0:09:19.02,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Don't you think that's kind of funny?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:19.49,0:09:21.52,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Then why?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.52,0:09:23.79,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Why did a monster in a raincoat come after her classmates?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.79,0:09:27.29,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Because the young lady wanted them beaten up.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.61,0:09:31.50,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,She was having a hard time just after her parents died,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.50,0:09:37.29,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,and she was being persecuted by her classmates, so it's not at all strange for her to have thoughts of revenge.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:38.32,0:09:39.26,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:39.26,0:09:43.94,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Of course, you think you were unconscious when you wished for that.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:43.94,0:09:48.11,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,In your own consciousness, you're sure you wished to run faster.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:48.11,0:09:50.15,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But that's just on the surface.  What lies beneath is different.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:50.46,0:09:55.65,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Underneath that wish lurked a dark desire to beat up your classmates.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:56.69,0:10:01.86,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Though it was unconscious, you know what really happened, young lady.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:02.16,0:10:06.73,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But you didn't want to admit it to yourself, so you went looking for a different explanation for that phenomenon,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:07.03,0:10:09.17,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,the Monkey's Paw.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:10.67,0:10:15.88,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It's your own rationalization, saying the assault on your classmates was the result
Dialogue: 0,0:10:15.88,0:10:19.56,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,of the Monkey's Paw twisting your wish, rather than it being your own intent.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:20.18,0:10:21.81,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But, Oshino...
Dialogue: 0,0:10:21.81,0:10:25.93,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Are you wondering what kind of proof I have, Araragi-kun?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:26.40,0:10:29.11,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,If you listen to her, isn't it obvious?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.11,0:10:32.56,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,What happened with that arm of yours in elementary school, young lady?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:33.77,0:10:40.47,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,You didn't realize it until the next day, when you went to class and the seats around you were empty, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:40.77,0:10:47.86,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,If your left arm had ended up like it is right now, you would've realized something had happened.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:47.86,0:10:51.42,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But you didn't say anything about that earlier.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:52.92,0:10:55.02,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Which means the oddity came one night, and
Dialogue: 0,0:10:55.02,0:11:02.33,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,without you noticing, it grafted onto your arm, beat up your classmates, and fulfilled your wish.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:02.33,0:11:07.43,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,And without you noticing, it separated you from your left arm.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:08.01,0:11:15.07,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It probably grew from a hand to an arm using the portion of your soul taken in exchange for granting that wish.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:15.07,0:11:17.44,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Hey, Oshino, that means{fscx200}-{fscx100}
Dialogue: 0,0:11:19.08,0:11:24.32,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Araragi-kun, you're really soft-hearted, believing in the assailant's excuse and all.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:24.65,0:11:26.95,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It wouldn't be surprising for her to be jealous of the man
Dialogue: 0,0:11:26.95,0:11:31.29,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,who swept away her beloved upperclassman enough to want to kill him.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:31.29,0:11:35.59,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,When she attacked you, it wasn't her wish being twisted.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:35.59,0:11:40.58,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Attacking you was what she really wanted.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:02.27,0:12:03.50,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It's about time.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:21.26,0:12:23.30,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I've been waiting.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:23.65,0:12:25.89,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Took you longer than expected.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:26.16,0:12:30.44,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah, it's because I didn't quite understand my limits.
