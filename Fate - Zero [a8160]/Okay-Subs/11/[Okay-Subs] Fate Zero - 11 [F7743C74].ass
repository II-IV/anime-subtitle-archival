Dialogue: 10,0:05:00.90,0:05:04.57,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, you did come here by foot, unlike me. Makes sense.
Dialogue: 10,0:05:04.99,0:05:09.66,Default,,0,0,0,,So you chose to hold the Banquet of Kings in this depressing place?
Dialogue: 10,0:05:09.66,0:05:13.91,Default,,0,0,0,,How will you make up for the rudeness of making me walk all the way here?
Dialogue: 10,0:05:13.91,0:05:16.12,Default,,0,0,0,,Aw, don't say that.
Dialogue: 10,0:05:16.92,0:05:19.29,Default,,0,0,0,,Here, start with a drink.

Dialogue: 10,0:05:36.10,0:05:40.65,Default,,0,0,0,,This was among the best I could find at the city marketplace.
Dialogue: 10,0:05:40.65,0:05:46.74,Default,,0,0,0,,That's because you are ignorant of true drink, foolish mongrel.
Dialogue: 10,0:05:56.33,0:05:59.46,Default,,0,0,0,,Behold, and acknowledge your folly.
Dialogue: 10,0:05:59.46,0:06:02.13,Default,,0,0,0,,This is the drink of a king.

Dialogue: 10,0:06:35.45,0:06:40.37,Default,,0,0,0,,Your finest drink is indeed worthy of the best vessel.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:40.37,0:06:43.67,Default,,0,0,0,,Unfortunately, the Grail is not a drinking cup.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:43.67,0:06:50.34,Default,,0,0,0,,First, you'll have to tell us the scale of the wish you have for the Grail.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:50.34,0:06:52.22,Default,,0,0,0,,Quit making distinctions, mongrel.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:52.22,0:06:57.85,Default,,0,0,0,,The premise of having to fight for the Grail already makes no sense to begin with.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:59.60,0:07:03.65,Default,,0,0,0,,The Grail already belongs to me.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:03.65,0:07:08.15,Default,,0,0,0,,Every single one of the world's treasures trace their origin back to my treasury.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:08.15,0:07:12.28,Default,,0,0,0,,So you're saying you once had the Grail?
Dialogue: 10,0:07:12.28,0:07:14.62,Default,,0,0,0,,You would know exactly what it is?
Dialogue: 10,0:07:14.62,0:07:15.70,Default,,0,0,0,,No.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:15.70,0:07:18.20,Default,,0,0,0,,Don't see this with your mongrel standards.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:18.20,0:07:22.75,Default,,0,0,0,,The wealth in my treasury has long\Nsince surpassed my own knowledge.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:22.75,0:07:27.25,Default,,0,0,0,,But the fact that it's treasure is enough to make it mine.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:27.25,0:07:29.97,Default,,0,0,0,,And anyone who would take it for themselves...
Dialogue: 10,0:07:30.59,0:07:33.72,Default,,0,0,0,,...is nothing but a brazen thief.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:33.72,0:07:38.06,Default,,0,0,0,,Your words are no different from Caster's insane rants.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:38.56,0:07:42.14,Default,,0,0,0,,It appears he isn't the only Servant to have gone mad.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:42.14,0:07:44.98,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, I don't know...
Dialogue: 10,0:07:46.52,0:07:51.24,Default,,0,0,0,,I think I have an idea what Goldy's real name is.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:51.99,0:07:53.61,Default,,0,0,0,,Then what, Archer?
Dialogue: 10,0:07:53.61,0:07:58.12,Default,,0,0,0,,Are you saying we just need your consent if we want the Grail?
Dialogue: 10,0:07:58.12,0:07:59.33,Default,,0,0,0,,Exactly.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:59.33,0:08:05.00,Default,,0,0,0,,However, I have absolutely no reason to\Nbestow such a gift to mongrels like you both.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:05.42,0:08:08.42,Default,,0,0,0,,Selfish, aren't you?
Dialogue: 10,0:08:08.42,0:08:09.26,Default,,0,0,0,,Fool.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:09.26,0:08:13.51,Default,,0,0,0,,Only my subjects and people\Nare worthy of my compassion.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:13.51,0:08:18.14,Default,,0,0,0,,In other words, Rider, if you submit yourself to me...
Dialogue: 10,0:08:18.93,0:08:23.14,Default,,0,0,0,,I can let you have a drinking cup or two anytime.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:23.14,0:08:26.44,Default,,0,0,0,,That's out of the question.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:26.44,0:08:31.82,Default,,0,0,0,,But, Archer, it's not like you\Nactually want the Grail, do you?
Dialogue: 10,0:08:31.82,0:08:32.90,Default,,0,0,0,,Of course not.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:32.90,0:08:38.08,Default,,0,0,0,,But I must administer my judgment\Nto thieves who are after my treasures.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:38.08,0:08:40.33,Default,,0,0,0,,It's a matter of principle.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:41.54,0:08:43.83,Default,,0,0,0,,So then, Archer...
Dialogue: 10,0:08:44.29,0:08:48.09,Default,,0,0,0,,What justice and reasoning do you speak of?
Dialogue: 10,0:08:48.09,0:08:49.04,Default,,0,0,0,,Of the law.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:49.50,0:08:52.80,Default,,0,0,0,,{\i1}My{\i0} law that {\i1}I{\i0} set down as king.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:52.80,0:08:54.80,Default,,0,0,0,,Perfect, indeed.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:55.34,0:08:58.26,Default,,0,0,0,,You're the king because you see your own law through.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:01.52,0:09:03.31,Default,,0,0,0,,But you know...
Dialogue: 10,0:09:03.31,0:09:06.85,Default,,0,0,0,,I want the Grail so much that I can't stop myself.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:06.85,0:09:10.36,Default,,0,0,0,,It's my style to simply take what I want.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:10.90,0:09:12.90,Default,,0,0,0,,After all, I'm Iskandar...
Dialogue: 10,0:09:13.69,0:09:15.95,Default,,0,0,0,,...King of Conquerors.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:16.61,0:09:18.41,Default,,0,0,0,,It doesn't matter.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:18.41,0:09:21.29,Default,,0,0,0,,You break the law, and I punish you.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:21.29,0:09:23.62,Default,,0,0,0,,There is no room for discussion.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:25.41,0:09:27.96,Default,,0,0,0,,Which means...
Dialogue: 10,0:09:27.96,0:09:30.54,Default,,0,0,0,,...all that's left for us is to cross swords.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:32.59,0:09:34.13,Default,,0,0,0,,Anyway, Archer.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:34.13,0:09:37.26,Default,,0,0,0,,Why don't we finish drinking this wine?
Dialogue: 10,0:09:37.26,0:09:39.76,Default,,0,0,0,,We can fight each other to the death afterwards.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:39.76,0:09:41.01,Default,,0,0,0,,But of course.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:41.01,0:09:46.35,Default,,0,0,0,,Or do you think light of this wine that I let you have?
Dialogue: 10,0:09:46.35,0:09:47.94,Default,,0,0,0,,Absolutely not!
Dialogue: 10,0:09:47.94,0:09:50.61,Default,,0,0,0,,How could I not help myself to such delicious wine?
Dialogue: 10,0:09:54.07,0:09:55.32,Default,,0,0,0,,King of Conquerors.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:56.49,0:10:03.99,Default,,0,0,0,,You acknowledge someone else's rightful\Nownership of the Grail, yet you'll take it by force?
Dialogue: 10,0:10:04.66,0:10:08.12,Default,,0,0,0,,Why would you go so far for the Grail?
Dialogue: 10,0:10:19.26,0:10:20.59,Default,,0,0,0,,True incarnation.
Dialogue: 10,0:10:20.59,0:10:21.60,Default,,0,0,0,,Huh?
Dialogue: 10,0:10:21.60,0:10:22.47,Default,,0,0,0,,Huh?!
Dialogue: 10,0:10:22.89,0:10:26.81,Default,,0,0,0,,Hey, wasn't your goal supposed to be world conquest—
Dialogue: 10,0:10:28.60,0:10:29.77,Default,,0,0,0,,Idiot.
Dialogue: 10,0:10:30.27,0:10:33.61,Default,,0,0,0,,What's the point in having some\Ndrinking cup conquer the world for me?
Dialogue: 10,0:10:33.61,0:10:36.36,Default,,0,0,0,,Conquest is a dream I'll entrust to myself.
Dialogue: 10,0:10:36.36,0:10:38.99,Default,,0,0,0,,All I want from the Grail...
Dialogue: 10,0:10:39.45,0:10:41.87,Default,,0,0,0,,...is the first step of that process.
Dialogue: 10,0:10:41.87,0:10:43.24,Default,,0,0,0,,Mongrel.
Dialogue: 10,0:10:43.24,0:10:48.08,Default,,0,0,0,,You'd challenge me for something so small?
Dialogue: 10,0:10:49.00,0:10:53.59,Default,,0,0,0,,Even if mana gives us form in this world, we still ultimately remain Servants.
Dialogue: 10,0:10:55.50,0:11:01.84,Default,,0,0,0,,I want to be firmly rooted to this world as a living human.
Dialogue: 10,0:11:02.26,0:11:06.43,Default,,0,0,0,,And with a body of my very own,\NI shall defy both heaven and earth.
Dialogue: 10,0:11:06.43,0:11:10.10,Default,,0,0,0,,That's what the act of conquest is all about.
Dialogue: 10,0:11:10.56,0:11:15.61,Default,,0,0,0,,It's how it begins, proceeds, and is finished.
Dialogue: 10,0:11:18.44,0:11:20.61,Default,,0,0,0,,Such is my path of conquest.
