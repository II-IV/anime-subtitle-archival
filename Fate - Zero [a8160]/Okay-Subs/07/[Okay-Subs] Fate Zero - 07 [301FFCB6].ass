Dialogue: 10,0:07:58.33,0:08:00.12,Default,,0,0,0,,No doubt about that.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:00.54,0:08:04.13,Default,,0,0,0,,But we have the advantage with regards to Caster.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:04.54,0:08:11.38,Default,,0,0,0,,Out of whatever madness, he believes Saber to be Jeanne d'Arc, which is to our benefit.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:11.84,0:08:13.97,Default,,0,0,0,,We just need to wait for him to come.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:14.55,0:08:17.01,Default,,0,0,0,,Master, that won't be enough.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:17.01,0:08:19.01,Default,,0,0,0,,His evil deeds cannot be tolerated.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:19.01,0:08:22.48,Default,,0,0,0,,We should go after him before the damage spreads further.

Dialogue: 10,0:08:32.61,0:08:36.12,Default,,0,0,0,,But our real problem is the curse on Saber's left arm.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:36.99,0:08:44.33,Default,,0,0,0,,Eighteen hours have passed since you\Ndefeated Kayneth, but Saber's arm won't heal.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:45.29,0:08:47.25,Default,,0,0,0,,Lancer must still be alive.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:48.04,0:08:53.09,Default,,0,0,0,,Shouldn't we defeat Lancer first,\Nso we can face Caster at full strength?
Dialogue: 10,0:08:53.09,0:08:54.59,Default,,0,0,0,,That's unnecessary.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:55.51,0:09:00.97,Default,,0,0,0,,Just use your knowledge of the area to confuse the enemy and keep Saber away from him.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:02.60,0:09:04.56,Default,,0,0,0,,You won't have her fight Caster?
Dialogue: 10,0:09:05.10,0:09:07.69,Default,,0,0,0,,Someone else will deal with him anyway.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:08.19,0:09:12.69,Default,,0,0,0,,In fact, the ones going after Caster\Nfrenziedly would make much better targets.
