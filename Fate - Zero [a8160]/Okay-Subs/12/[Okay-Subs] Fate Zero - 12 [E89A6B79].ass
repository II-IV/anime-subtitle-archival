Dialogue: 10,0:03:29.27,0:03:37.53,Default,,0,0,0,,{\i1}Berserker should probably be left alive due to his strange special ability, if only to distract Archer and Tohsaka.

Dialogue: 10,0:04:57.36,0:05:01.44,Default,,0,0,0,,{\i1}However, it all makes sense if\Nhe was after me from the start.
Dialogue: 10,0:05:01.44,0:05:02.61,Default,,0,0,0,,{\i1}But why?
Dialogue: 10,0:05:02.61,0:05:03.86,Default,,0,0,0,,{\i1}Why pursue me?

Dialogue: 10,0:05:46.90,0:05:48.95,Default,,0,0,0,,That hasn't changed.
Dialogue: 10,0:05:48.95,0:05:54.29,Default,,0,0,0,,However, I am now curious to see this Holy Grail War to the end.

Dialogue: 10,0:05:58.37,0:06:02.13,Default,,0,0,0,,Individuals who harbor grand ambitions, not knowing they aren't fit for the task.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:02.13,0:06:05.80,Default,,0,0,0,,Simply observing such people gives me great enjoyment.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:05.80,0:06:08.43,Default,,0,0,0,,There are two kinds of pride.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:08.43,0:06:13.18,Default,,0,0,0,,One where you aren't fit for the task,\Nand one where your desires are too grand.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:13.81,0:06:16.68,Default,,0,0,0,,The former is commonplace stupidity...
Dialogue: 10,0:06:17.44,0:06:20.81,Default,,0,0,0,,...but the latter is rare and difficult to come by.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:20.81,0:06:24.73,Default,,0,0,0,,But they're identical in that they're both stupid, no?
Dialogue: 10,0:06:26.53,0:06:31.87,Default,,0,0,0,,Isn't rare stupidity far more\Nprecious than commonplace wisdom?
Dialogue: 10,0:06:31.87,0:06:39.96,Default,,0,0,0,,{\q2}Those who have renounced their humanity for the\Nsuperhuman wishes they harbor despite being born human...
Dialogue: 10,0:06:39.96,0:06:45.30,Default,,0,0,0,,I never grow weary of watching their grief and despair.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:48.09,0:06:53.39,Default,,0,0,0,,Kirei, you seem to be in a good mood yourself, for once.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:53.80,0:06:55.64,Default,,0,0,0,,I am simply relieved.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:55.64,0:07:00.48,Default,,0,0,0,,I've finally been freed from an unpleasant burden.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:00.98,0:07:04.36,Default,,0,0,0,,What happens to the Command Spells once they disappear?
Dialogue: 10,0:07:04.36,0:07:09.11,Default,,0,0,0,,In theory, they return to the Grail.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:09.11,0:07:16.99,Default,,0,0,0,,{\q2}The Holy Grail retakes the Command Spells from a\NMaster who has lost his Servant and is thus out of the war.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:16.99,0:07:27.63,Default,,0,0,0,,{\q2}And if a Servant loses its Master, the Grail will take those\Nunused Spells and redistribute them to a newly chosen Master.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:27.63,0:07:31.47,Default,,0,0,0,,The Command Spells remain in this world until they are used.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:31.47,0:07:36.81,Default,,0,0,0,,Any that remain at the end are given to the judge.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:36.81,0:07:43.52,Default,,0,0,0,,So, depending on what happens from\Nnow on, a new Master may yet appear?
Dialogue: 10,0:07:43.52,0:07:44.65,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:44.65,0:07:49.19,Default,,0,0,0,,However, those that the Grail would\Ndeem eligible are few in number.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:49.82,0:07:59.54,Default,,0,0,0,,Thus, when a new Master is sought, the Grail tends to select those it has previously found suitable.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:02.37,0:08:03.37,Default,,0,0,0,,What's wrong?
Dialogue: 10,0:08:03.37,0:08:05.84,Default,,0,0,0,,Continue, Kirei.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:07.21,0:08:13.09,Default,,0,0,0,,That's the reason the Holy Church protects those who've dropped out of battle.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:13.09,0:08:17.01,Default,,0,0,0,,Should an empty place open\Namong the remaining Masters,
Dialogue: 10,0:08:17.01,0:08:22.73,Default,,0,0,0,,there is a high probability that an ex-Master will receive the unused Command Spells.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:23.23,0:08:30.86,Default,,0,0,0,,This is why Grail War participants try to kill\Nenemy Masters rather than simply disable them.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:32.36,0:08:38.87,Default,,0,0,0,,From that theory, Kirei, is there not a good chance that you will receive Command Spells yet again?
Dialogue: 10,0:08:38.87,0:08:40.33,Default,,0,0,0,,Impossible.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:40.33,0:08:50.80,Default,,0,0,0,,If the Holy Grail chose me to support the Tohsaka camp like Tokiomi suggested, then I have fulfilled my duty.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:51.13,0:08:57.26,Default,,0,0,0,,Tokiomi has already prepared a winning strategy for the remaining Masters and their Servants.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:58.14,0:09:00.39,Default,,0,0,0,,There's nothing more for me to do.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:00.39,0:09:05.56,Default,,0,0,0,,If you ask me, Tokiomi's hypotheses have been dubious from the start.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:05.94,0:09:11.11,Default,,0,0,0,,He never struck me as worthy enough to\Nreceive that much backing from the Grail.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:11.11,0:09:16.53,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm surprised you have such harsh\Nwords to say about your own Master.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:16.53,0:09:22.50,Default,,0,0,0,,Kirei, you seem to be sorely mistaken as to who serves whom in my relationship with Tokiomi.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:22.50,0:09:28.96,Default,,0,0,0,,He pays me every due respect as my subject and supplies me with mana as an offering.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:28.96,0:09:33.76,Default,,0,0,0,,I answered his summons precisely\Nbecause those were the terms of our pact.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:34.34,0:09:37.38,Default,,0,0,0,,What do you make of the Command Spells, then?
Dialogue: 10,0:09:37.38,0:09:38.51,Default,,0,0,0,,I don't like them.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:38.51,0:09:42.85,Default,,0,0,0,,However, if a subject wishes to perform his duties better,
Dialogue: 10,0:09:42.85,0:09:46.89,Default,,0,0,0,,he must be willing to listen to criticism from time to time.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:46.89,0:09:48.52,Default,,0,0,0,,More importantly, Kirei.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:48.52,0:09:53.44,Default,,0,0,0,,You mentioned that the Assassins have fulfilled all their duties.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:53.44,0:09:55.53,Default,,0,0,0,,But what of the matter we discussed?
Dialogue: 10,0:09:55.53,0:09:59.99,Default,,0,0,0,,Your interest in learning the motives of each Master in seeking the Grail?
Dialogue: 10,0:10:00.49,0:10:03.08,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes, that investigation is more or less completed.
Dialogue: 10,0:10:03.08,0:10:07.21,Default,,0,0,0,,I should've had Assassin report\Nhis findings in person last night.
Dialogue: 10,0:10:07.21,0:10:09.21,Default,,0,0,0,,That would've saved me the trouble of—
Dialogue: 10,0:10:09.21,0:10:11.38,Default,,0,0,0,,No, this is just fine.
Dialogue: 10,0:10:11.38,0:10:14.76,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm not interested in what that shadow has to say.
Dialogue: 10,0:10:15.17,0:10:20.85,Default,,0,0,0,,Kirei, this report is meaningless unless it comes from your lips.
Dialogue: 10,0:10:31.15,0:10:34.57,Default,,0,0,0,,How does it feel to drive a car, Saber?
Dialogue: 10,0:10:34.57,0:10:37.11,Default,,0,0,0,,It is indeed a splendid thing to steer.
Dialogue: 10,0:10:37.11,0:10:40.66,Default,,0,0,0,,I can't help but think what would've\Nhappened if these had existed in my time.
Dialogue: 10,0:10:41.49,0:10:45.95,Default,,0,0,0,,Irisviel, are you sure it's all right that I drive this vehicle?
Dialogue: 10,0:10:45.95,0:10:49.75,Default,,0,0,0,,You seemed to enjoy the act of driving.
