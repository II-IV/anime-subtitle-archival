Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.13,0:04:09.54,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,I found this among the best for \Nsale at the local marketplace.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.54,0:04:14.10,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,You can only say that due to \Nyour ignorance of true wine,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.39,0:04:15.78,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,you mongrel.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.38,0:04:25.24,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,Oh!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.54,0:04:28.55,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,Behold, and be amazed.

Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.33,0:04:50.94,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,Be it wine or swords,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.94,0:04:54.25,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,only the best is held in my treasury.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.59,0:05:02.36,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,I believe this alone should settle \Nthe matter of who is the true king.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.25,0:05:04.36,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,Archer.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.62,0:05:09.40,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,Your wine is exquisite and certainly \Ndeserves the finest of cups.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.40,0:05:12.65,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,Unfortunately, the Holy Grail \Nis no mere wine goblet.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.65,0:05:16.23,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,Our discussion on the Grail \Ncannot progress further
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.23,0:05:19.25,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,until we learn your reason for seeking it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.25,0:05:21.13,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,You do not command me, mongrel.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.39,0:05:24.63,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,First, given that we each \Nstrive for the Grail already,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.63,0:05:26.86,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,our reasons are meaningless.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.75,0:05:30.47,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,But that is beside the point.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.47,0:05:32.60,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,The Grail is mine, to begin with.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.60,0:05:37.08,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,Without exception, every treasure in this \Nworld can be traced to my collection.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.08,0:05:41.15,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,So have you held the Grail?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.15,0:05:43.60,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,Would you know it by its appearance?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.60,0:05:44.65,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,No.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.65,0:05:47.16,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,My criteria for possession are entirely \Ndifferent from you mongrels.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.16,0:05:49.11,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,The vastness of my storehouse
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.11,0:05:51.49,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,overtook my personal knowledge \Nof its inventory long ago.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.89,0:05:56.22,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,But that a treasure exists \Nis enough to show that it is mine.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.22,0:05:58.42,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,For another to claim it...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.48,0:06:02.63,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,They would be the most foolhardy of thieves.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.63,0:06:07.08,Default,Saber,0000,0000,0000,,Your words make as much sense as Caster's.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.54,0:06:11.05,Default,Saber,0000,0000,0000,,Apparently, he is not the only \NServant suffering from delusions.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.05,0:06:13.89,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,Come now.  I'm not so sure.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.35,0:06:20.60,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,I think I have an idea as to Shiny's true name.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.60,0:06:22.35,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,But, Archer,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.35,0:06:26.13,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,then you have no particular \Ndesire for the Grail to grant.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.13,0:06:27.11,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,Of course not.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.34,0:06:32.35,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,But I must punish those \Nwho would raid my coffers.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.35,0:06:34.52,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,It is a logical reason.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.09,0:06:38.50,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,Tell me, Archer.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.81,0:06:42.39,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,What are the justice and the reasoning behind that?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.39,0:06:43.25,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,The law.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.69,0:06:47.01,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,The law I enacted as king.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.59,0:06:50.38,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,If you break it, I shall punish you.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.38,0:06:52.87,Default,Arch,0000,0000,0000,,Discussion has no place.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.75,0:06:57.01,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,If that's the case...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.01,0:06:59.52,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,There's nothing for us but combat.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.97,0:07:02.33,Default,Saber,0000,0000,0000,,King of Conquerors.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.44,0:07:08.76,Default,Saber,0000,0000,0000,,You accept that another may lay \Nrightful claim to the Grail,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.76,0:07:11.14,Default,Saber,0000,0000,0000,,yet you would take it for yourself by force?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.70,0:07:12.78,Default,Saber,0000,0000,0000,,For what reason
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.26,0:07:15.33,Default,Saber,0000,0000,0000,,do you seek its power?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.18,0:07:27.59,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,T-To be reincarnated.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.59,0:07:29.47,Default,Waver,0000,0000,0000,,What?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.47,0:07:32.86,Default,Waver,0000,0000,0000,,Hey!  Don't you want to conquer the world—
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.59,0:07:36.97,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,Idiot.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.83,0:07:40.75,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,No matter how powerful the magic \Nthat has brought us to this era,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.75,0:07:42.48,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,we are still Servants.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.37,0:07:47.11,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,I wish to live a real life in this world,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.79,0:07:50.74,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,as a human.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.08,0:07:55.34,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,And with my own two hands, I shall \Nstand against Heaven and Earth!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.34,0:07:58.99,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,That is the essence of conquest!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.57,0:08:02.50,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,So it begins, persists,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.50,0:08:04.50,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,and finally ends.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.39,0:08:09.51,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,This is my path of conquest.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.06,0:08:15.26,Default,Saber,0000,0000,0000,,That is not how a king should act.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.26,0:08:16.20,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,Oh?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.57,0:08:22.27,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,Then tell us the desires of your own heart.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:41.96,0:08:43.79,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,King of Knights,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:44.20,0:08:47.41,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,you claim that you would change fate?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:47.41,0:08:50.79,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,Meaning that you would alter history itself?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.79,0:08:52.23,Default,Saber,0000,0000,0000,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:52.23,0:08:55.60,Default,Saber,0000,0000,0000,,Even this is a wish a miracle \Ncannot bring to pass,

Dialogue: 0,0:09:04.45,0:09:06.61,Default,Rider,0000,0000,0000,,You are saying that
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.39,0:09:11.44,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,you'd erase history shaped by you yourself?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:11.44,0:09:15.17,Default,Saber,0000,0000,0000,,Yes!  Why do you question \Nme?  And why do you laugh?!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.17,0:09:16.49,Default,Saber,0000,0000,0000,,The homeland to which I gave my life,
