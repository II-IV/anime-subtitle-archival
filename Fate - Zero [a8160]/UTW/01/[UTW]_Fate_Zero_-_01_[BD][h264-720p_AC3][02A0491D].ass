Dialogue: 4,0:05:05.91,0:05:15.00,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Actually, many years ago, proof was found that the Holy Grail\Nthat appears in Fuyuki City does not belong to the Son of God.
Dialogue: 4,0:05:15.00,0:05:16.50,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Indeed.
Dialogue: 4,0:05:16.50,0:05:22.13,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Otherwise, the order to retrieve it would've been given to us of the 8th Sacrament Assembly.
Dialogue: 4,0:05:22.13,0:05:26.97,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,However, the Holy Grail in Fuyuki is too powerful to ignore.
Dialogue: 4,0:05:26.97,0:05:29.60,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It's an omnipotent wish-granting device, after all.
Dialogue: 4,0:05:29.60,0:05:34.14,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Who knows what disaster it could cause should it fall into the wrong hands?
Dialogue: 4,0:05:34.60,0:05:44.15,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Thus, it is best if we ensure that the Grail\Nat least falls into the right hands as a plan B.
Dialogue: 4,0:05:44.15,0:05:50.87,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,The Tohsaka family are indeed Magi, but they also have a long history of friendship with the Church.

Dialogue: 4,0:05:55.29,0:05:59.67,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Moreover, his intentions for the Grail are clear.

Dialogue: 4,0:06:01.88,0:06:05.26,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,That is the sole desire of the Tohsaka family.
Dialogue: 4,0:06:05.67,0:06:13.56,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,However, both the Einzberns and the Matous have forgotten the wish we once shared.
Dialogue: 4,0:06:13.76,0:06:18.39,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I don't think I need to explain the case for the other Masters.
Dialogue: 4,0:06:18.39,0:06:23.86,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Who knows what dark plans they may have for the Grail?
Dialogue: 4,0:06:24.23,0:06:32.58,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,So I'll be participating in the coming Holy Grail War to ensure Tohsaka Tokiomi's victory, then.
Dialogue: 4,0:06:32.58,0:06:39.50,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Of course, we'll act as enemies seemingly fighting over the Grail.
Dialogue: 4,0:06:39.50,0:06:49.84,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But beneath the surface, we'll work together to defeat the other five Masters and attain certain victory.
Dialogue: 4,0:06:50.59,0:06:52.60,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,And there you have it, Kirei-kun.
Dialogue: 4,0:06:52.60,0:06:59.85,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,You will be transferred from the Church to the\NMage's Association, where you will become my student.
Dialogue: 4,0:06:59.85,0:07:02.35,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,The official orders have already been issued.
Dialogue: 4,0:07:02.77,0:07:06.23,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,You will go to Japan and study magic,
Dialogue: 4,0:07:06.23,0:07:14.74,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,and become a Mage strong enough to command a Servant in the Holy Grail War in three years.
Dialogue: 4,0:07:18.95,0:07:20.00,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Now then...

Dialogue: 4,0:07:26.00,0:07:31.80,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,What exactly is the Grail's will in choosing its Masters?
Dialogue: 4,0:07:34.64,0:07:40.81,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,The Grail prefers to choose Masters that need it the most.
Dialogue: 4,0:07:40.81,0:07:44.56,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Does that mean all the Masters have a reason to covet the Grail?
Dialogue: 4,0:07:44.56,0:07:46.57,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Not necessarily.
Dialogue: 4,0:07:46.57,0:07:53.11,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,There have been cases where Command Spells appeared on individuals you wouldn't expect to be chosen.
