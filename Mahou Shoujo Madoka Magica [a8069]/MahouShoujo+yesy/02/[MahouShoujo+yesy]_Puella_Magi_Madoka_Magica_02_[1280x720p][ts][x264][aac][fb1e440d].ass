Dialogue: 0,0:00:13.83,0:00:17.03,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,A senior at Mitakihara Middle School, just like you two.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.56,0:00:26.13,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,And... I'm a magical girl that has made a contract with Kyubey.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.05,0:00:41.23,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Another weird dream...
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.09,0:00:45.78,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Good morning, Madoka!
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.78,0:02:24.37,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,This show is brought to you by the sponsors you see here.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.94,0:02:35.58,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Madoka, I heard you got back late last night.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.58,0:02:37.89,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,An upperclassman from school invited me to their house.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.57,0:02:44.64,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I won't be an annoying mom and impose a curfew or anything like that, but make sure you call home before dinner.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.94,0:02:46.91,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm sorry.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.94,0:02:57.66,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I guess people really can't see him.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.38,0:03:17.09,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Wow...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.51,0:03:17.08,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,What a beautiful room!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.45,0:03:19.91,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I live alone, so make yourselves at home.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.91,0:03:22.59,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I didn't really have time to get ready for guests though.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.95,0:03:29.48,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Mami-san, this is really good!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.48,0:03:31.33,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It's totally good!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.33,0:03:32.48,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.97,0:03:37.74,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Since you've been chosen by Kyubey, this is your problem as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.00,0:03:40.57,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I thought a decent explanation of what has been going on would be in order.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.57,0:03:43.19,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Sure! Just ask me anything.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.19,0:03:44.99,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Sayaka-chan, you have that backwards.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.44,0:03:49.48,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Wow, that's pretty!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.48,0:03:51.00,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,This is a Soul Gem.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.00,0:03:55.99,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It's a jewel created by the girls that are chosen by Kyubey, born of their contract.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.99,0:04:00.47,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It identifies them as a magical girl and is the source of their magic power.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.47,0:04:01.22,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,What do you mean by contract?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.64,0:04:05.51,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I'll grant each of you one wish, whatever you want.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.51,0:04:07.46,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,What? Seriously?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.46,0:04:08.88,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,A wish...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.88,0:04:10.02,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It can be anything.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.40,0:04:12.64,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,No matter the miracle, I can make it happen.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.52,0:04:16.68,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Gold, silver, and priceless treasures... Immortality...

Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.84,0:04:20.98,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Umm, I'm not sure about that last one...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.98,0:04:24.57,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,But a Soul Gem is produced in exchange.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.03,0:04:29.16,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Those that receive these jewels are charged with a mission to fight witches.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.62,0:04:30.83,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Witches?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.94,0:04:37.54,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Hey, Mom.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.89,0:04:38.87,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Hm?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.87,0:04:46.63,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,What if... What if you were told that any wish you had could be granted with magic, what would you do—
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.63,0:04:49.75,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I'd get rid of a few of those board members.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.27,0:04:59.58,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,The president is getting a bit too old for this too—it's time for him to think about retirement.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.58,0:05:01.69,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,But there's no one to replace him, so...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.00,0:05:05.55,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You should become president yourself, Mom.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.49,0:05:10.41,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I didn't think about that.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.78,0:05:17.53,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,As long as I make sure I work things out with sales in advance, planning and administration will do whatever I want.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.53,0:05:20.01,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,If that happens, the only problem left is the baldy in accounting.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.01,0:05:21.17,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I know... I'll just pull off his toupée.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.42,0:05:24.70,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Mom, you look scary.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.97,0:05:30.55,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,What's a witch? Are they different from magical girls?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.85,0:05:36.44,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,If magical girls are said to be born from positive desires like wishes, then witches are born from negative desires like curses.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.78,0:05:41.53,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Magical girls spread hope, where witches spread despair.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.53,0:05:45.08,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,And to make matters worse, they can't be seen by normal humans.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.74,0:05:49.62,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Doubt and suspicion, extreme anger and hate.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.62,0:05:52.62,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,They bring seeds of catastrophe to this world.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.96,0:05:59.33,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,The curse of a witch is almost always behind unexplained suicides and murders.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.30,0:06:05.01,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,They become a formless evil and eat away at humans from the inside-out.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.01,0:06:09.13,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,If they're so dangerous, how come no one knows about them?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.13,0:06:14.85,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,That's because witches hide within barriers and never show themselves to people.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.31,0:06:18.85,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,The labyrinth-type area you wandered into before was one of their barriers.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.29,0:06:22.03,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,That was pretty close.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.03,0:06:26.40,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Humans swallowed up by those barriers usually don't make it out alive.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.40,0:06:29.65,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Mami-san, you're fighting something that dangerous?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.65,0:06:32.42,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,That's right. I put my life on the line.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.42,0:06:35.49,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,That's why I think you two should weigh your options carefully.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.92,0:06:41.52,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Any desire you have can be granted, now that you've been chosen by Kyubey.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.52,0:06:43.92,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,But doing so can lead to death.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.17,0:06:48.15,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,That's a hard choice...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.63,0:06:54.05,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,So, I had an idea. Why don't you come along with me while I take out some witches?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.05,0:06:54.64,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.12,0:06:59.64,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It'll be better for you to see through your own eyes what it means to fight witches.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.08,0:07:07.38,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Once that happens, you can think about whether or not you have a wish so great that you'd risk putting yourself in danger.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.93,0:07:12.50,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Good morning!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.50,0:07:13.73,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Good morning.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.73,0:07:14.54,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Good mor—
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.54,0:07:16.41,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Morning, Sayaka.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.13,0:07:20.38,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Is something the matter, Sayaka-san?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.06,0:07:24.43,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I guess we really are the only ones that can see him.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.43,0:07:25.59,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Seems that way.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.59,0:07:26.85,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Umm...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.85,0:07:29.64,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Don't worry about it. Let's go.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.93,0:07:36.77,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It looks like we can talk to each other just by thinking.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.77,0:07:40.56,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Huh? We already have magical powers like that?!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.56,0:07:44.78,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,No, no, I'm still just using myself to relay your thoughts.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.78,0:07:47.55,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,But it's pretty useful for talking to each other without anyone hearing, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.25,0:07:50.41,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It feels kind of weird.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.87,0:07:53.93,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,What's going on between the two of you?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:53.93,0:07:55.89,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You keep exchanging looks.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.89,0:07:58.91,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,N-No, we've been... umm...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.95,0:08:04.65,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Have you two grown so close that you can understand each other by looking into each others' eyes?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:04.65,0:08:08.42,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Oh my! I can't believe you've gotten that close\Nto each other after a single day.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.87,0:08:11.18,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,What happened after I saw you yesterday?!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.18,0:08:13.77,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,That'd... never happen. Seriously.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.77,0:08:16.43,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It's true a lot of things happened, though.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.43,0:08:20.37,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,But two girls mustn't do such things!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.37,0:08:25.19,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,That's forbidden love!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.82,0:08:28.09,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You forgot your bag!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.32,0:08:33.11,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Hitomi-chan is kind of like Sayaka-chan today.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:33.11,0:08:35.40,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,What's that supposed to mean?!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:44.94,0:08:49.89,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Are you sure it's okay for you to come to school with us like nothing happened?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.89,0:08:51.00,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Why?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:51.28,0:08:56.11,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I told you that the girl from yesterday transferred into this class, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.11,0:08:58.47,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Wasn't she trying to kill you?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.47,0:09:01.43,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I actually think school would be safer.
