Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.82,0:03:30.22,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,This isn't a show, you know?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.53,0:03:35.14,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I don't want you to forget that what we're doing is dangerous.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.14,0:03:36.16,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Yes!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.48,0:03:41.05,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It didn't drop a Grief Seed.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.05,0:03:44.71,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,That's because it was just a familiar that split off from a witch.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.71,0:03:46.80,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,They don't have Grief Seeds.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.80,0:03:48.53,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,So it wasn't a witch.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.53,0:03:51.77,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,We haven't been able to find any lately.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.77,0:03:54.01,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,We can't ignore the familiars, though.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.30,0:03:58.00,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,They develop into witches just like the original, if they mature.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.97,0:04:00.65,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Anyway, let's go.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.09,0:04:04.60,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Did you two find something to wish for?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.89,0:04:07.20,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,What about you, Madoka?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.35,0:04:12.39,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Well, I guess that's normal. Especially when you actually try to think of something specific.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.07,0:04:15.93,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Mami-san, what type of wish did you make?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.90,0:04:20.38,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,No, you don't really have to tell me!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.45,0:04:23.86,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,In my case, I...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.84,0:04:37.63,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,didn't even have the time to think about it.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.81,0:04:41.73,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It's not like I regret it.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.13,0:04:47.39,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I think my current way of life is much better than having died back there.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.85,0:04:53.66,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,But you know, I think it's better for a girl to carefully consider what they want if they have the opportunity to do so.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.32,0:04:57.81,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Especially since I didn't have that opportunity, you know?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.81,0:05:04.15,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Hey, Mami-san, does your wish have to be for yourself?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.15,0:05:04.65,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.65,0:05:08.22,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Like hypothetically... Hypothetically, you know?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.84,0:05:12.04,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,What if there was someone worse off than me,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.04,0:05:14.30,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,and I used my wish for them?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.58,0:05:16.26,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You mean Kamijou-kun?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.26,0:05:19.24,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,God, I said I was just speaking hypothetically!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.24,0:05:24.29,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It's not really necessary for the person in the contract to be the target of the wish.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.82,0:05:26.68,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It's not like it hasn't happened before, either.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.11,0:05:29.87,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I can't say I like what you're saying, though.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.75,0:05:33.02,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,If you're considering granting a wish for someone else,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.02,0:05:36.31,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,then it's even more important that you pause now to consider what you really want.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.31,0:05:40.03,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Miki-san, do you want his wish to come true,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.43,0:05:43.82,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,or do you just want to be the person who made his wish come true—a person to which he'd be indebted?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.82,0:05:45.11,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Mami-san...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.11,0:05:48.28,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,They might sound the same, but they're completely different.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.80,0:05:52.04,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,That was kind of mean.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.30,0:05:55.77,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm sorry, but I needed to say that now.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.33,0:06:01.04,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,If you don't realize the difference early on, you're going to regret it later.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.10,0:06:07.33,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You're right.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.96,0:06:09.98,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I wasn't thinking hard enough.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.42,0:06:11.06,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Sorry about that.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.06,0:06:15.05,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,This is pretty difficult stuff to deal with, isn't it?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.83,0:06:17.84,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You shouldn't just rush and pick something.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.55,0:06:21.74,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,The sooner the better for me, though.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.74,0:06:25.84,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,That won't do. Girls hate guys who pressure them.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.42,0:06:34.49,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It really isn't that simple, is it?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.49,0:06:37.21,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Considering my position, I can't really push you to make a choice, either.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.48,0:06:39.56,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Giving you any suggestions on the matter is against the rules, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.33,0:06:43.70,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I wonder if just wanting to become one is enough.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.05,0:06:47.43,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Madoka, are you just after the power?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.43,0:06:49.79,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,No, that's not what I mean...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.90,0:06:53.60,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Or maybe it is...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.60,0:06:57.44,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm slow, and there isn't really anything good about me.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.44,0:07:04.27,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,So if I could be cool and wonderful like Mami-san, that would make me more than happy.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.27,0:07:08.45,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You can become far stronger than Mami if you become a magical girl.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.65,0:07:09.45,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.90,0:07:14.05,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Of course, it also depends on what kind of wish you make when you form the contract,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.05,0:07:18.96,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,but even I can't estimate how large of a Soul Gem you might produce.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.36,0:07:22.51,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I've never met a girl with such potential before.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.29,0:07:27.29,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,What are you talking about? You must be joking.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.29,0:07:28.06,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,No—
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.19,0:07:30.87,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Madoka, are you awake?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.87,0:07:32.71,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah, what's wrong?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.17,0:07:39.36,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Again?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.36,0:07:40.65,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Jeez...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.37,0:07:44.11,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,W-W-Water...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.26,0:07:53.94,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Damn you, baldy! If you want to drink, drink by your damn self!

Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.68,0:07:56.54,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.94,0:07:58.71,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Should I get some hot chocolate started?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.71,0:08:00.26,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah, that'd be good.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.83,0:08:04.76,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I wonder why Mom likes working so much.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.45,0:08:10.28,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Working at that company wasn't really a dream of hers, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.28,0:08:15.61,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Hmm... Mom doesn't like working, she likes working hard.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.61,0:08:16.27,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.47,0:08:19.99,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm sure there are a lot of things that she doesn't like or are pretty trying for her,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:19.99,0:08:25.53,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,but the satisfaction she gets when she overcomes those obstacles is really precious to her.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.00,0:08:32.05,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It wasn't like it was her dream to work somewhere.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.05,0:08:35.78,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,But still, she's living the way she wants to live.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.78,0:08:38.43,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Some dreams can come true like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.73,0:08:42.04,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,So you can make how you live your dream?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:42.78,0:08:49.26,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm sure there are people who'd disagree, but I really like that about your mom.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.26,0:08:51.30,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I can respect that and I take pride in it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:51.30,0:08:53.20,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I can tell people she's a wonderful person.

Dialogue: 0,0:09:14.90,0:09:17.57,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,They've been chosen by Kyubey.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.57,0:09:19.27,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,They're not "innocent civilians" any longer.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.20,0:09:23.03,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You're leading the two of them into becoming magical girls.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.79,0:09:25.92,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,And that's what you don't like?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:25.92,0:09:27.50,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,That's right. It's a nuisance.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.35,0:09:29.91,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Especially Kaname Madoka.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:32.26,0:09:36.45,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I see. So you've noticed her potential, as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.16,0:09:40.23,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I can't let her form a contract under any circumstances.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:40.23,0:09:43.33,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Is it because anyone stronger than you will get in your way?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:43.71,0:09:45.54,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,That sounds like something a person who's been bullied her whole life would think.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:49.09,0:09:51.29,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I would prefer not fighting you.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.38,0:09:55.49,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,In that case, you need to work hard so I don't run into you again.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:55.49,0:10:00.26,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm sure tonight's the last time we'll end this with talking.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:12.61,0:10:14.41,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Hey. Sorry for the wait.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:14.41,0:10:17.57,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Huh? You couldn't see Kamijou-kun?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:17.57,0:10:20.43,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I guess today wasn't a good day to see him.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:20.86,0:10:22.52,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I came all the way out here, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:22.52,0:10:24.04,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Pretty rude, huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:28.49,0:10:29.73,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,What's wrong?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.73,0:10:31.95,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,There's something over there...
Dialogue: 0,0:10:34.32,0:10:35.82,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It's a Grief Seed!
