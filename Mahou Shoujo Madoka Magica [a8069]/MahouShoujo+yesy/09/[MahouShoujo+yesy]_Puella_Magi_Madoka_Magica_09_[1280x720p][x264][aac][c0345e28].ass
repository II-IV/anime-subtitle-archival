Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.38,0:06:55.89,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Madoka, do you know the word "entropy?"
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.21,0:07:00.77,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,To give you a simple example, the heat energy you gain by burning wood in a campfire
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.77,0:07:04.28,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,is unequal to the amount of energy it takes to grow the tree you're burning.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.28,0:07:07.99,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,When you convert energy between forms, there's loss involved.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.99,0:07:11.45,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,And so, the total amount of energy in the universe is diminishing.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.23,0:07:17.49,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,That's why we searched for a form of energy not bound by the laws of thermodynamics,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.49,0:07:21.96,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,and what we discovered was the magical energy from magical girls.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.88,0:07:26.84,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,What... are you?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.23,0:07:33.99,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Our civilization developed the technology to convert the emotions of sentient lifeforms into energy.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.99,0:07:38.90,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,But unfortunately, we ourselves don't have any emotions.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.90,0:07:44.69,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,So we started to look into all the various types of species across the universe, and we found humans.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.78,0:07:51.23,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,The number of human individuals and their reproductive rate
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.23,0:07:58.53,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,indicates that the amount of emotional energy produced by a single human exceeds the amount of energy that was expended during its birth and growth.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.21,0:08:03.92,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Your souls are capable of generating enough energy to overcome entropy.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.29,0:08:09.63,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,The most effective source of energy comes from the phase change between hope and despair of young women

Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.40,0:08:20.06,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,When a Soul Gem burns away and changes into a Grief Seed—in that moment, an enormous amount of energy is released.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.06,0:08:24.81,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It's our job—the Incubators'—to collect that energy.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.64,0:08:29.28,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Are we just disposable to you?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.28,0:08:32.40,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Are we supposed to just die for you?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.84,0:08:39.81,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Do you know how many civilizations are crowded together in the universe and how much energy is used up in one second?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.81,0:08:45.51,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Eventually you humans will leave this planet as well and join us.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:45.51,0:08:50.07,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You wouldn't want to be handed an empty, desolate universe then, would you?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.07,0:08:54.93,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,So if you look at it in the long-term, we believe this to be a beneficial trade for all of you as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.43,0:08:58.35,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You can't be serious...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.35,0:09:05.10,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You're telling me that Mami-san died and Sayaka-chan went through so much just for something crazy like that?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:05.97,0:09:07.57,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,That's too much...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.57,0:09:08.98,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,That's too cruel.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:10.42,0:09:14.89,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Our contracts are completely dependent upon you agreeing to them first.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:14.89,0:09:17.99,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I think that, in and of itself, is quite kind of us.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.99,0:09:20.28,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You're just tricking everyone!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.28,0:09:24.55,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,We don't even understand what it means to trick someone.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:24.55,0:09:28.36,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,For some reason, whenever a human regrets a bad choice they've made due to a difference in understanding with someone,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.36,0:09:31.05,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,they start to detest that person.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.85,0:09:35.21,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I can't even follow what you're saying.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:35.76,0:09:37.92,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I can't accept it at all.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.92,0:09:42.72,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,We have a pretty hard time understanding your value system too.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:42.72,0:09:48.67,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Right now there are six billion, nine hundred million of you, and every four seconds, you grow by ten.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:48.67,0:09:52.62,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Why do you make such a fuss if a single one of you lives or dies?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.62,0:09:58.73,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,If you really think that, then you are our enemies.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:59.29,0:10:02.10,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I came here to try and explain our actions for you, you know?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:02.10,0:10:09.96,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,, I wanted you to understand just how significant your sacrifices are, but it doesn't look like that'll happen.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:10.35,0:10:11.75,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Of course not.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:11.75,0:10:18.34,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Madoka, someday you will become the greatest magical girl, and then the worst witch.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:18.87,0:10:23.77,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,At that moment, we'll gain an extremely large amount of energy, the likes of which has never been seen before.

Dialogue: 0,0:11:02.16,0:11:04.60,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Not as far as I know.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:06.70,0:11:11.39,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Does that mean there are things you don't know then?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:11.39,0:11:14.56,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Magical girls defy established logic.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:14.56,0:11:19.19,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I wouldn't be surprised by any absurd things you accomplish.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:19.19,0:11:20.99,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,So it's possible then.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:20.99,0:11:22.95,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It hasn't happened before,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:22.95,0:11:25.50,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,so I don't know how you'd go about it.
