Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.62,0:00:23.92,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Y-Yeah...
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.92,0:00:30.50,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm sorry, but the date of his examination was moved up, so he's in the rehabilitation area right now.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.50,0:00:33.74,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I see... thanks.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.65,0:00:39.14,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,She sure visits a lot, doesn't she?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.72,0:00:42.81,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah, but I'm glad she does. That patient is difficult to handle.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.17,0:00:45.81,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I hope she's cheering him up.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.34,0:00:50.71,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,He was a violin prodigy before the accident, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.71,0:00:54.46,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Even if he were able to walk again...
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.46,0:00:57.53,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,it's likely he'll never be able to play an instrument with those fingers.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.89,0:01:05.03,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Out of all people, why did that happen to Kyousuke?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.10,0:01:13.07,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,No matter how much I move my fingers, they don't do any good to anyone.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.43,0:01:17.27,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Why did that happen to Kyousuke instead of me?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.38,0:01:26.48,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,If I use my wish to heal him, what would he think?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.02,0:01:30.99,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Would he just tell me thank you? Would that be it?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.99,0:01:33.94,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Or do I want him to say something more?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.31,0:01:40.99,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm... a horrible person.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.40,0:01:47.10,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Now that I think about it, back then I still didn't know anything;
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.94,0:01:51.42,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,just what it meant to wish for a miracle, and what it would cost.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.43,0:03:27.17,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,This show is brought to you by the sponsors you see here.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.72,0:03:38.39,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Is that a mole?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.39,0:03:39.81,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,There, I got it.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.79,0:03:54.38,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Madoka?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.68,0:03:55.33,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.58,0:03:57.88,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,If you don't hurry up and eat, you'll be late to school.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.88,0:03:59.21,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Y-Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.80,0:04:12.61,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,What's wrong, Nee-chan?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.61,0:04:14.32,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,W-Was the food bad?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.39,0:04:17.96,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,No, it's good.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.55,0:04:20.36,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It's really good.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.63,0:04:25.30,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Because I'm alive, I get to experience my dad's great cooking...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.92,0:04:32.32,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,And, like, I kept telling Yuuka and she still didn't get it.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.32,0:04:37.68,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,She was almost crying, like, "Huh? What? Did I say something weird again?"
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.68,0:04:41.28,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I was trying so hard not to laugh.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.28,0:04:43.51,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Sayaka-chan, about yesterday...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.80,0:04:47.06,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Sorry. Not right now. We'll talk later.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.06,0:04:48.95,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,That's totally weird, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.95,0:04:51.08,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah, that's kind of...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.29,0:04:59.23,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,While it's true that our understanding of a woman's prime childbearing age is based off of scientific evidence,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.23,0:05:04.12,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,using this to estimate a woman's age of marriageability is a huge mistake.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.12,0:05:10.76,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Thus, women over thirty plainly still have the chance for a loving marriage.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.76,0:05:17.29,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Which means that you shouldn't be using the past perfect here, but rather the present progressive tense—
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.70,0:05:33.24,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It kind of feels like we're in a different country now.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.02,0:05:44.40,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,School, Hitomi-chan—nothing's changed since yesterday. But it feels like I'm surrounded by strangers.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.73,0:05:46.90,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Nobody knows what we know.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.45,0:05:50.92,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Nobody knows about the witches or Mami-san.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.19,0:05:55.19,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,We know, and nobody else does.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.19,0:06:00.09,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It's like we're living in a different world, seeing different things.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.93,0:06:02.37,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Sayaka-chan...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.96,0:06:05.48,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It all changed a long time ago.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.07,0:06:09.80,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,We should've realized it sooner.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.26,0:06:13.88,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,What about you, Madoka?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.88,0:06:18.07,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Do you still want to become a magical girl?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.55,0:06:28.84,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah... That makes sense.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.91,0:06:34.80,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I know it's not fair... It's pretty selfish for me to back out now,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.67,0:06:37.99,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,but... I just can't...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.57,0:06:44.03,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Just remembering how she died... I can't breathe.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.92,0:06:46.41,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm so scared.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.41,0:06:47.84,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I hate this.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.70,0:06:56.41,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Mami-san was really kind.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.53,0:07:05.32,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,As an example of the resolve we'd need to fight, she...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.60,0:07:11.33,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Hey, Kyubey, what'll happen to this city?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.94,0:07:17.28,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Who will protect everyone from the witches now that Mami-san's gone?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.06,0:07:24.03,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,This has been Mami's territory for a while now, but now that there's no one here, the other magical girls will act.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.64,0:07:27.71,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Others hunting for witches will come here soon.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.02,0:07:34.22,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,But they're just after the Grief Seeds, right? Just like that transfer student.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.51,0:07:37.63,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It's true that Mami was a rare breed.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.63,0:07:40.52,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Normally you'd be less inclined to put yourself in danger if you didn't stand to gain something from it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.52,0:07:42.48,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Everybody wants to be rewarded for their actions, after all.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.48,0:07:43.51,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,So that means...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.51,0:07:50.99,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,But I think only another magical girl would really be able to criticize that.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.02,0:07:57.21,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I understand how you two feel.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.21,0:08:00.45,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It's unfortunate, but I can't pressure you into it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.36,0:08:02.59,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I guess this is it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.59,0:08:07.00,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I need to go search again for girls who need my contract.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.30,0:08:10.06,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm sorry, Kyubey.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.53,0:08:13.67,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Me too. I'm sorry for getting you involved.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.86,0:08:19.94,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It was short, but it was fun being with you, Madoka. Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.78,0:08:29.84,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm sorry.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:06.21,0:09:10.26,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm sorry I'm so weak...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:10.78,0:09:11.95,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm sorry.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:24.21,0:09:25.97,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Homura-chan...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:32.33,0:09:36.18,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You're blaming yourself too much for this, Kaname Madoka.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.18,0:09:36.83,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.47,0:09:41.18,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,There's no one who can criticize you for your choices.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:41.64,0:09:43.60,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,If there was, I'd never forgive them.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:46.41,0:09:49.19,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You listened to my warning.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.29,0:09:52.06,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:55.61,0:09:59.94,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,If I had listened to you sooner...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:59.94,0:10:03.43,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,That still wouldn't have changed Tomoe Mami's fate.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.68,0:10:08.83,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,But you were able to change your own.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:09.32,0:10:12.66,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm happy I was able to save at least one person.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.20,0:10:23.97,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Y-You know, Homura-chan... You seem like a veteran, but in a different way from Mami-san.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:23.97,0:10:26.51,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,That might be true. I won't deny it.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.71,0:10:34.21,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Have you seen a lot of people die like yesterday?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:35.07,0:10:35.98,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I have.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:38.14,0:10:39.79,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,How many?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:40.77,0:10:42.87,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Enough to give up on counting.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:46.33,0:10:49.58,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I wonder if her room will stay like that forever.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:50.56,0:10:54.09,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Tomoe Mami only had distant relatives.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:55.41,0:10:59.13,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm sure it'll be a while before anyone reports her missing.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:59.58,0:11:03.18,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,No one... will notice that she died?
