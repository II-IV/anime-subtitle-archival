Dialogue: 4,0:00:01.03,0:00:03.81,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Akemi Homura: she who flies against time.
Dialogue: 4,0:00:05.52,0:00:12.02,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You've relived the last month repeatedly and transversed several different parallel worlds by changing probabilities in the past,
Dialogue: 4,0:00:12.02,0:00:14.70,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,in pursuit of the resolution you'd like for all of this.
Dialogue: 4,0:00:15.70,0:00:19.75,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Your presence here has answered a question of mine—
Dialogue: 4,0:00:20.30,0:00:26.00,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,namely, exactly why Kaname Madoka carries such great potential as a magical girl.
Dialogue: 4,0:00:26.00,0:00:28.46,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Now I can form a reasonable hypothesis.
Dialogue: 4,0:00:30.11,0:00:35.45,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,The latent ability of a magical girl is determined by the relative effect of their role on fate.
Dialogue: 4,0:00:35.45,0:00:41.53,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I could understand if she was the princess of a country or some sort of hero,
Dialogue: 4,0:00:41.53,0:00:46.32,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,but I was at a loss as to why Kaname Madoka, with her average life, was the collective center of so much.
Dialogue: 4,0:00:47.03,0:00:49.88,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,But say, Homura,
Dialogue: 4,0:00:50.42,0:00:57.16,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,don't you think it'd make sense if Madoka became a powerful magical girl because you've continued to relive the same time over and over?
Dialogue: 4,0:01:00.30,0:01:04.09,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I knew it. You're the cause.
Dialogue: 4,0:01:04.09,0:01:08.10,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,I guess it'd be better to describe it a side-effect of your magic.
Dialogue: 4,0:01:08.10,0:01:09.75,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,What do you mean?
Dialogue: 4,0:01:09.75,0:01:14.67,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You've reversed time for a single reason. You want to protect Kaname Madoka.
Dialogue: 4,0:01:15.45,0:01:23.22,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You've probably heavily intertwined a number of parallel worlds by traveling back in time over and over for the same reason and purpose,
Dialogue: 4,0:01:24.02,0:01:27.14,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,with Kaname Madoka at the center of everything.
Dialogue: 4,0:01:27.57,0:01:31.89,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,If, as a result, these "lines of fate" from other parallel worlds—
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.89,0:01:35.78,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,which under normal circumstances should never interact with each other—all connected to the Madoka in this timeline,
Dialogue: 4,0:01:36.42,0:01:40.53,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,then I could see why she'd have such extraordinary power.
Dialogue: 4,0:01:40.53,0:01:46.78,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,All of this fate—this cause and effect—circulating within the time period you've continued to live repeatedly
Dialogue: 4,0:01:46.78,0:01:52.30,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,has spun together and linked to Madoka, because she is the reason for everything.
Dialogue: 4,0:01:54.60,0:01:56.32,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Excellent work, Homura.
Dialogue: 4,0:01:56.32,0:01:59.63,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,You're the one responsible for making Madoka the strongest magical girl ever.

Dialogue: 4,0:06:48.24,0:06:50.38,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,It was their own desire.
Dialogue: 4,0:06:51.35,0:06:58.04,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,No matter the desire, if it's something irrational, then it will always distort reality in some way if it comes true.
Dialogue: 4,0:06:58.62,0:07:02.30,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Then it's obvious that natural law dictates that only bad could eventually come from that.
Dialogue: 4,0:07:02.30,0:07:09.21,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,If you want to call the result of that action "betrayal," then having the wish in the first place would be the mistake.
Dialogue: 4,0:07:10.13,0:07:13.03,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,But I won't call it foolish.

Dialogue: 4,0:07:33.50,0:07:39.78,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,If you understand that, then how can you treat the fate of a few humans at most differently than the rest of humanity's?
Dialogue: 4,0:07:41.07,0:07:45.56,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Have you felt nothing watching all of those girls all this time?
Dialogue: 4,0:07:45.56,0:07:50.59,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,Didn't you try to understand just how much they were going through?
Dialogue: 4,0:07:50.59,0:07:56.33,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,If we were able to understand, we wouldn't have had to go out of our way to come to this planet in the first place.
Dialogue: 4,0:07:57.12,0:08:03.25,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,In our civilization, the phenomenon you call emotions is regarded as nothing more than an extremely rare mental disorder.
Dialogue: 4,0:08:03.25,0:08:06.86,Madoka,,0000,0000,0000,,That's why we were surprised when we found you humans.
