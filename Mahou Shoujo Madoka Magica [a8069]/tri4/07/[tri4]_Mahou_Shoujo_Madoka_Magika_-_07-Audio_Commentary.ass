Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.19,0:02:18.70,ryooko,,0,0,0,,Because Sayaka and Homura are pretty different, right? Obviously. So when I took Hitomi...

Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.87,0:02:25.95,chiwa,,0,0,0,,How did you interpret the role of Hitomi?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.95,0:02:32.92,ryooko,,0,0,0,,Somehow, when I first took Sayaka and Homura, there was a slight overview of the scenario, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.92,0:02:39.68,ryooko,,0,0,0,,When I saw that, I knew that she'd be a character who'd change Sayaka quite a bit.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.35,0:02:51.27,ryooko,,0,0,0,,After I was told, I thought "Ah, what should I do?"
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.27,0:02:56.90,ryooko,,0,0,0,,When I had first seen the script, I thought she was like a tidy {\i1}ojou-sama{\i0}, so...
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.65,0:02:56.90,chiwa,,0,0,0,,Mm, that's right. Right, right, right.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.90,0:03:06.54,ryooko,,0,0,0,,At this point, I thought that if she was going to move out of righteousness to grant her love, then I sort of had a guess...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.54,0:03:11.50,ryooko,,0,0,0,,Well, my image of her was that of a sincere {\i1}ojou-sama{\i0}.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.15,0:03:33.35,ryooko,,0,0,0,,Somehow, you know...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.35,0:03:36.77,ryooko,,0,0,0,,She's upfront, but also too much of a thief, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.40,0:03:37.19,ao-chan,,0,0,0,,Mm, mm.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.77,0:03:39.82,chiwa,,0,0,0,,That's right. Right, right. But, that's...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.82,0:03:43.24,chiwa,,0,0,0,,Um, that's true for their age range though.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.15,0:03:41.70,ao-chan,,0,0,0,,Mm.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.24,0:03:48.49,chiwa,,0,0,0,,They're middle schoolers, so they'll end up hurting each other's feelings and such. You understand when seeing that sort of thing.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.80,0:04:02.18,ryooko,,0,0,0,,That is, somehow, she's a "properly righteous and strong" person...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.18,0:04:05.51,ryooko,,0,0,0,,Well, it's just that she probably doesn't know much about Sayaka's circumstances.
