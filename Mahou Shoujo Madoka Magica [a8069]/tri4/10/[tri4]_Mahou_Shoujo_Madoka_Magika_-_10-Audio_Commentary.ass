Dialogue: 0,0:10:00.53,0:10:06.75,ao-chan,,0,0,0,,But somehow, a chairwoman can't do anything at all without the people around her, I think.

Dialogue: 0,0:10:06.75,0:10:14.88,chiwa,,0,0,0,,It's fine! Because Ao-chan is the one who's the youngest, and I'm pretty close in age with everyone else around me...

Dialogue: 0,0:10:14.88,0:10:22.72,chiwa,,0,0,0,,But, really, with Ao-chan as the chairwoman, I feel like I was able to do work with a good feeling that actually created an environment.

Dialogue: 0,0:10:24.81,0:10:31.61,chiwa,,0,0,0,,Up until now, I've been a relatively young one in the workplace, so I've had many {\i1}senpai{\i0} around me who would lend guidance,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:31.61,0:10:36.44,chiwa,,0,0,0,,so I could do acting that had feeling to it, but I was mostly focused on myself;

Dialogue: 0,0:10:42.41,0:10:46.66,chiwa,,0,0,0,,So then Ao-chan can be the one with the best feeling, who creates an environment with her acting.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:46.66,0:10:50.83,chiwa,,0,0,0,,Regarding both the Madoka who tries to escape, and the Madoka who isn't shaken up at all.

Dialogue: 0,0:11:03.43,0:11:08.52,chiwa,,0,0,0,,Since Ao-chan was around for all of this, she properly knows, really knows, that "Then, please take care of it!" was said...
Dialogue: 0,0:11:08.52,0:11:11.60,chiwa,,0,0,0,,Because the mutual faith thing was understood...
Dialogue: 0,0:11:11.60,0:11:14.90,chiwa,,0,0,0,,That's why somehow, this time, the workplace was extremely...
Dialogue: 0,0:11:14.90,0:11:22.32,chiwa,,0,0,0,,Somehow, since everyone around you was doing good work, you could do good work, and you respected everyone...
