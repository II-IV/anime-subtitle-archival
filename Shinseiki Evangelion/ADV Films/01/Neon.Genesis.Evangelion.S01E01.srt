1
00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:06,168
Just like the cruel angel

2
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:13,847
Young boy, become a legend

3
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:27,956
Even though the untested breeze
taps at the door to your heart

4
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:36,256
You just look solely at me and smile

5
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:42,738
So intent on seeking out that gentle touch

6
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:50,748
Such innocent eyes, still ignorant
of their destiny

7
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:57,755
But someday, you are sure to realize
that upon your back

8
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:05,673
You have the wings with which to fly
towards the distant future

9
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:10,869
The cruel angel's thesis

10
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:14,607
Soon, you will take flight from the windowsill

11
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:18,377
With your torrent of ardent pathos

12
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:22,080
If you are to betray our memories

13
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,717
You, who embrace these heavens and shine

14
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:28,999
Young boy, become a legend

15
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:32,607
The year is 2015 A.D.

16
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:58,607
As of 12:30 PM today, a special state
of emergency has been declared

17
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:02,816
for the Kanto and Chubu regions
surrounding the Tokai district.

18
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:07,364
All residents must evacuate to their
designated shelters immediately.

19
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,797
Repeating: As of 12:30 PM today,

20
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,597
All Lines Stopped
Repeating: As of 12:30 PM today,

21
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,233
All Lines Stopped
the Kanto and Chubu regions
surrounding the Tokai district

22
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,984
the Kanto and Chubu regions
surrounding the Tokai district

23
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,993
have been declared to be under
a state of emergency.

24
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,972
All residents must evacuate...

25
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,442
Why did I have to lose sight of him now?

26
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,278
Oh, man!

27
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,313
Shinji lkari

28
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,914
Shinji lkari
Due to the special emergency,

29
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:29,875
Due to the special emergency,

30
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,953
all lines are currently unavailable.

31
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:35,658
It's no use.

32
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,843
I shouldn't have come here after all.

33
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:43,429
To Shinji
I'll be coming
to get you,
so wait for me.
Attention here please!!

34
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,430
To Shinji
I'll be coming
to get you,
so wait for me.
Attention here please!!
Well, I guess we won't be meeting here.

35
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:45,751
Well, I guess we won't be meeting here.

36
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,213
Can't be helped. I'll go to a shelter.

37
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:15,194
Estimated Path

38
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,234
Estimated Path
The unidentified mobile object is still
advancing on our position.

39
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:22,273
We've got visual confirmation.
I'm putting it on the main screen.

40
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,947
It's been fifteen years, hasn't it?

41
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,109
Yes, there's no doubt.

42
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:30,676
It's an Angel.

43
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,987
Episode One
Angel Attacks

44
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,166
Every missile hit the target!

45
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,977
I'm sorry! Thanks for waiting!

46
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:26,202
The target is still operational.
It's still heading towards New Tokyo-3.

47
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,053
The Air Defense Force doesn't have
the firepower to stop it!

48
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,337
Hit it with everything we've got!

49
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,068
Mobilize all of Atsugi and Iruma as well!

50
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:36,363
Don't hold anything back!
Destroy the target at any cost!

51
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,800
Why?! That was a direct hit!

52
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,094
The tank battalion's been annihilated.

53
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:58,030
Guided missiles and artillery
have no effect either.

54
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,567
It's no good! We'll never get anywhere
with the firepower we've got!

55
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:03,435
Is it an AT field after all?

56
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:06,916
Yes. Conventional weapons are
useless against Angels.

57
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,650
I understand. We'll activate it as planned.

58
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,162
Hey, don't tell me...

59
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,060
They're going to use an N2 mine?!

60
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:23,688
Get down!

61
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:47,373
We did it!

62
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,569
Sorry, but it looks like you won't be
getting a shot at it.

63
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,948
Shock wave approaching.

64
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:56,592
Are you all right?

65
00:05:56,823 --> 00:06:00,159
Yeah, but my mouth is full of dirt.

66
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,640
That's okay. Now then, here we go!

67
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:05,968
One, two!

68
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,306
There.

69
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,681
Thanks for the hand. I really appreciate it.

70
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,640
Thank you too, Miss Katsuragi.

71
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,890
Just Misato is fine.

72
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:25,546
I'm glad we've met at last, Shinji lkari.

73
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,103
Yeah...

74
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:28,731
What's the target's status?

75
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,505
We're unable to confirm due to
all the EMP interference.

76
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,355
You saw the size of the explosion. It's over.

77
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,021
Sensors restored.

78
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,107
We've got an energy reading
at the explosion's epicenter!

79
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,389
What the hell?!

80
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,030
Visual display restored.

81
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,465
That was our last resort.

82
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,577
How can this be?

83
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,008
Damned monster!

84
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,266
Yes. Don't worry about it.

85
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,195
His safety is my top priority,
so could you get a car train ready for us?

86
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:10,842
A direct one.

87
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:12,715
Right.

88
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,534
Well, I volunteered to pick him up,

89
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,905
so I'll make sure he gets there. See ya!

90
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:26,222
Man, this sucks! I just had my car restored
and it's a total wreck already!

91
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:30,217
33 more loan payments to go,
plus the cost of repairs.

92
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,904
And look! My best dress has been ruined!

93
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:33,585
Um, Miss Misato...

94
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,354
And I was looking and feeling so nice.
Um, Miss Misato...

95
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:37,465
And I was looking and feeling so nice.

96
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:38,994
Excuse me, Misato?

97
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,535
What?

98
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,193
Are you sure you can just take those?

99
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,148
Never mind about that!

100
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,643
It's an emergency, and we need
a working car right now, right?

101
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,240
And I'm an international government
official, after all,

102
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,140
so everything's going to be
perfectly fine, okay?

103
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,020
I don't think anyone will buy that.

104
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:03,012
You're no fun. You look cute,
but you're kind of a cold fish.

105
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:05,621
You think so?

106
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,371
Oh, did I upset you?

107
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,311
Sorry about that! You are a boy, after all.

108
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,691
And you're pretty childish for your age.

109
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,380
As we predicted, it's regenerating itself.

110
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:27,436
If it couldn't, it wouldn't be
a practical autonomous weapon.

111
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:34,703
Impressive. It appears it can even upgrade
its own operational functions.

112
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,472
And it seems to have gotten smarter.

113
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:41,334
It's only a matter of time before
it resumes attacking.

114
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,658
The gates are now closing.
Please stand clear.

115
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,193
The special duty organization Nerv?
Now departing.

116
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:48,394
Yes, it's a secret organization under
the control of the United Nations.
Now departing.

117
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,497
Yes, it's a secret organization under
the control of the United Nations.
This is the C-22 Special Express
departing directly for G33-1.

118
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:51,997
This is the C-22 Special Express
departing directly for G33-1.

119
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,632
That's where my father is, right?
This is the C-22 Special Express
departing directly for G33-1.

120
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:54,800
Well, yeah.
This is the C-22 Special Express
departing directly for G33-1.

121
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,802
Do you know what he does?
This is the C-22 Special Express
departing directly for G33-1.

122
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:56,913
This is the C-22 Special Express
departing directly for G33-1.

123
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,739
This train will bypass all other stations.
Please stand back.

124
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,974
My teacher told me his work is vital
for the protection of the human race.
This train will bypass all other stations.
Please stand back.

125
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:04,525
My teacher told me his work is vital
for the protection of the human race.

126
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,494
From this point forward, command of this
operation will be entrusted to you.

127
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,380
Show us what you're capable of.

128
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:13,612
Yes, Sir.

129
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,680
Ikari, we will admit that our weapons
have no effect on the target.

130
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,437
But are you sure you can beat this thing?

131
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,047
It's what Nerv was created for.

132
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,008
Let's hope you're correct.

133
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,706
The target is still stationary.

134
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,998
Our intercept system is currently
7.5% operational.

135
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,127
So, even the UN forces have retired.

136
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,879
What are you going to do?

137
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,331
I intend to activate Unit 01.

138
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:46,537
Unit 01?7 But we have no pilot.

139
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:50,714
That's not a problem. Another spare
will be delivered soon.

140
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,525
Are you taking me to my father?

141
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,201
Yes. Pretty much.

142
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,411
Father...

143
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:07,097
Oh, that's right. Did you get
an ID card from your father?

144
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:10,279
Yes.

145
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:12,978
Here it is.

146
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,046
Thanks.

147
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:14,480
Come.
Gendo lkari
Thanks.

148
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:15,151
Come.
Gendo lkari

149
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,250
Then read this.

150
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:18,984
Welcome to Nerv

151
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:19,918
Welcome to Nerv
Nerv...

152
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,149
Nerv...

153
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,164
My father's agency.

154
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,866
Am I going to work for them too?

155
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,369
Of course.

156
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,348
He wouldn't have sent me a letter unless
he needed me for something.

157
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:35,925
I see. So you don't get along with your father.

158
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:39,103
It's the same with me.

159
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:46,388
Awesome!

160
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,237
It's a real Geo-Front!

161
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:50,305
That's right.

162
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,502
This is our secret base.
Nerv Headquarters.

163
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:55,647
This is the key to rebuilding our world.

164
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,092
A fortress for all mankind.

165
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,266
That's strange. Isn't this the right way?

166
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:08,901
Nerv Headquarters
Around here
That's strange. Isn't this the right way?

167
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,072
That's strange. Isn't this the right way?

168
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,538
Central Dogma's closed passages
remain sealed.

169
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:12,971
This is why I hate wearing skirts here.

170
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,340
This is why I hate wearing skirts here.
Opening block B-26 in sequence.

171
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:15,841
Opening block B-26 in sequence.

172
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,809
But where the heck did Ritsuko go?
Opening block B-26 in sequence.

173
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:18,510
But where the heck did Ritsuko go?

174
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,138
I'm sorry. I'm just not used to this place yet.

175
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,298
We passed this spot just a little while ago.

176
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,178
But don't worry about it.

177
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,288
They make these systems
to be used, you know.

178
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:32,024
Would the head of Project E,
Technical Department Division 1,

179
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,893
Dr. Ritsuko Akagi, Dr. Ritsuko Akagi,

180
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,094
Air
please contact Captain Misato Katsuragi
of Operations, Division 1, immediately.

181
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:39,115
please contact Captain Misato Katsuragi
of Operations, Division 1, immediately.

182
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,500
I don't believe it.

183
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:42,351
She got lost again, didn't she?

184
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,750
Uh, hiya, Ritsuko.

185
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,760
What were you doing, Captain Katsuragi?

186
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,109
We're short on both time
and manpower, you know.

187
00:11:58,885 --> 00:11:59,785
Sorry!

188
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,799
So this is the boy?

189
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:08,551
Right. According to the Marduk report,
he's the "Third Child".

190
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,689
I'm glad to meet you.

191
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,507
Huh? Sure.

192
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:17,309
He's just like his father.
Like how he's unendearing.

193
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,414
I'll leave the rest to you.

194
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,970
Their first meeting in over three years.

195
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,500
Vice Commander, the target
has started moving again.

196
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:34,007
Right. All personnel, assume
battle stations, Level One.

197
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,956
Repeat. All personnel, assume
battle stations, Level One.

198
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,187
Prepare for ground-unit interception.

199
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,093
Here we go.

200
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,174
It sounds pretty serious.

201
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,631
So, how's Unit 01 doing?

202
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:48,000
It's currently in refrigeration,
using the B-type equipment.

203
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:52,004
Does it really work?
It's never worked before, right?

204
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:56,345
The possibility of activation is 0.000000001%.

205
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,045
We call it, pathetically enough,
the O-9 System.

206
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,714
Does that mean it doesn't work?

207
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:05,183
Oh, don't be insulting. It's not zero.

208
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,674
Well, it's just a number.

209
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:10,933
Anyway, it's a bit too late to be saying,
"Sorry, it didn't work".

210
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,529
Huh? It's completely dark.

211
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:28,868
A face? A giant robot?

212
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,810
You won't find this in the manual.

213
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:38,183
This is mankind's ultimate
multipurpose decisive weapon,

214
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:42,087
the synthetic human Evangelion, Unit O1.

215
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:47,088
Built in absolute secrecy,
it is mankind's trump card.

216
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,328
Is this part of what my father's been doing?

217
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,118
Correct.

218
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,367
It's been a while.

219
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,590
Father...

220
00:13:58,805 --> 00:13:59,474
We're moving out!

221
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:03,113
Moving out?! Unit 00's still in
cryo-stasis, isn't it?

222
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,407
You're not planning to use Unit 01?!

223
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,015
There's no other way.

224
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,536
Hold on! Rei can't do it yet, can she?

225
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,050
We've got no pilot!

226
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,175
One's just been delivered.

227
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:19,491
Are you serious?

228
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:21,660
Shinji lkari...

229
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:22,761
Yes?

230
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:23,661
You will pilot it.

231
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:28,887
But even Rei Ayanami took seven months
to synchronize with her Eva.

232
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,978
It's impossible for him to do it!
He just got herel

233
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,832
He just has to sit in the seat.
We don't expect more than that.

234
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,111
But...

235
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,649
Repelling that Angel is our ultimate priority.

236
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,639
To do that, we have no choice but to put
aboard the Eva whomever has the chance

237
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,369
to synchronize with it, no matter how slight.

238
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,619
I believe you know that, Captain Katsuragi.

239
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:52,493
I suppose...

240
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,661
Father, why did you send for me?

241
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,797
You know exactly why.

242
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:02,228
So, you're asking me to take this thing
and fight that thing?

243
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,403
That's right.

244
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:08,073
No way! Why are you doing this now?!

245
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,675
I thought you didn't need me!

246
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,606
I called you because I have a need for you.

247
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:16,708
Why me?

248
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,477
Because no one else can.

249
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,910
No, I can't...

250
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:25,655
I've never even seen anything
like this before! I can't do this!

251
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,289
You will be instructed.

252
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,465
But there's no way I can do this!

253
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,545
I can't pilot it!

254
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,930
If you're going to pilot it, do it now
and quickly. If not, leave!

255
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,204
It must have detected our location.

256
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,857
Shinji, we don't have time.

257
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,151
Get into it.

258
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:11,466
No! I didn't come for this! This isn't fair!

259
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,326
Shinji, just why did you come here?

260
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:22,244
You mustn't run! Not from your father,
and most of all not from yourself.

261
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,952
I know that! But there's no way I can do it!

262
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:36,465
Fuyutsuki...

263
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:39,297
Wake up Rei.

264
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,799
Can we use her?

265
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,170
She isn't dead.

266
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:44,493
I understand.

267
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:47,305
Rei.

268
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,440
Yes?

269
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:51,309
Our spare is unusable. You will do it again.

270
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,160
Yes, Sir.

271
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:57,983
Reconfigure Unit 01's system to Rei,
then re-activate!

272
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:00,674
Roger. Call off the present work,
and begin re-activation.

273
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,392
I knew it. I'm not needed after all.

274
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,626
Watch out!

275
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,938
The Eva moved!

276
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,139
What's going on?!

277
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,508
It broke the right arm restraint!

278
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:57,879
No, that's impossible!

279
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,779
It didn't even have an entry plug inserted!

280
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,860
There's no way it could have moved!

281
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,109
It reacted without any interface?!

282
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,253
Or was it protecting...

283
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,154
him?

284
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,459
We can do it.

285
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:37,215
I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away.
I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away.

286
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,235
I mustn't run away!

287
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:40,609
Il do it.

288
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,410
I'll pilot it!

289
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:47,392
Cooling process, completed.

290
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:48,927
Right arm re-secured.

291
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:50,962
Cage contents now in position for docking.

292
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:51,896
Roger.

293
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,387
Signal terminator plug has been ejected.

294
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,869
Roger. Inserting entry plug.

295
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,560
Direct hydro-transmission system,
connection prepared.

296
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,478
Plug fixed in place.

297
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,999
First stage connection initiated.

298
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,728
Filling the entry plug.

299
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:17,352
What is this stuff?

300
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,496
Don't worry. Once your lungs
are filled with LCL,

301
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,265
your blood will be oxygenated directly.

302
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,436
You'll get used to it.

303
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:33,505
I feel nauseous.

304
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,496
Stop whining! You're a boy, aren't you?!

305
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,209
Connecting main power.

306
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,912
All circuits transmitting power.

307
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:41,746
Roger.

308
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,207
Commencing secondary contacts.

309
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:47,419
A-10 nerve connection, normal.

310
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:51,990
Set the thought configuration to Japanese.

311
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,927
All preliminary contacts established.
Performance nominal.

312
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,508
Bi-directional circuits are open.

313
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,484
Synchronization rate at 41.3%.

314
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:02,667
Amazing.

315
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,828
Harmonics are all normal.
No disturbances identified.

316
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,939
We can do it.

317
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:10,522
Prepare to launch!

318
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14,179
Prepare to launch!

319
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,470
Disengage primary lock bolts!

320
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,963
Disengage confirmed.
Disengaging the umbilical bridge.

321
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:23,985
Disengage secondary lock bolts.

322
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,426
Disengage primary restraints.

323
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,567
Likewise, disengage secondary restraints.

324
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,268
Release safety locks numbers
one through fifteen.

325
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,169
Release confirmed.

326
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,839
Currently, Unit 01's condition is free.

327
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,474
Internal batteries fully charged.

328
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,254
External battery outlet, normal.

329
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,657
Roger. Move Eva Unit 01
to the ejector pad.

330
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,266
Launch path is clear. All systems green.

331
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:07,068
Ready for launch.

332
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,120
Roger.

333
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:11,169
Can we really do this?

334
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,100
Of course.

335
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,355
Unless we defeat the Angels,
we have no future.

336
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:19,873
Ikari, you're really sure about this?

337
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:22,731
Launch!

338
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,656
Shinji, don't get killed out there.

339
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,384
To Be Continued

Eva triumphs over the Angel!

342
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,186
Eva triumphs over the Angel!

343
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:10,177
However, that was just the beginning.

344
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,323
Shinji runs away from his father.

345
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:15,314
Misato's arrogance leads her
to try to save him.
