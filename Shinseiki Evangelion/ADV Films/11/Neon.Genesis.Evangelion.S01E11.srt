1
00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:06,368
Just like the cruel angel

2
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:14,047
Young boy, become a legend

3
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:28,156
Even though the untested breeze
taps at the door to your heart

4
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:36,457
You just look solely at me and smile

5
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:42,938
So intent on seeking out that gentle touch

6
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:50,948
Such innocent eyes, still ignorant
of their destiny

7
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:57,956
But someday, you are sure to realize
that upon your back

8
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:05,873
You have the wings with which to fly
towards the distant future

9
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:11,070
The cruel angel's thesis

10
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,807
Soon, you will take flight from the windowsill

11
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:18,577
With your torrent of ardent pathos

12
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:22,280
If you are to betray our memories

13
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,917
You, who embrace these heavens and shine

14
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,199
Young boy, become a legend

15
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,386
Cool! I won, I won!

16
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:48,039
Coin Cleaning

18
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:49,842
Thank you very much

19
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:50,976
Thank you very much
Boy, the cost of doing laundry
has been killing me lately.

20
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:53,279
Boy, the cost of doing laundry
has been killing me lately.

21
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,048
I wish I at least had the time
to wash my own clothes.

22
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,152
You should appreciate the fact you can
at least sleep at home.

23
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:00,485
Please make sure to take your pass.

Train Approaching

26
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,799
Hello, Vice Commander.

27
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,852
Good morning, Sir.

28
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,302
Good morning, Sir!

29
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,593
Morning.

30
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,308
You're quite early today.

31
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:25,144
Well, I have to go up top in lkari's place.

32
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,147
I see. Isn't today the City Council's
regular meeting?

33
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,149
It's a pointless job.

34
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,085
Ikari has always thrust the sundry tasks onto me.

35
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,689
Without the Magi, I'd be lost.

36
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,159
Speaking of which, the city elections
are approaching up there, right?

37
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,361
The City Council is merely a shell.

38
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:45,898
The municipal government, after all,
is in fact run by the Magi.

39
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:49,101
The Magi? You mean the
three supercomputers?

40
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:52,371
Government by majority decision
of three different computers.

41
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,982
It's a system that is properly in line
with the fundamentals of democracy.

42
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:58,811
And the council just obeys their decisions?

43
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:02,048
It's a most efficient form of government.

44
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:03,916
That's a city of science for you.

45
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,452
It's really an era where science reigns supreme.

46
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,287
Talk about an old-fashioned line.

47
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,924
Come to think of it, you're running
an experiment on Unit 00, aren't you?

48
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:16,925
Yes, we're going to run the second
prolonged activation test at 10:30.

49
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:19,094
I'm looking forward to good news.

50
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,015
Abort experiment! Cut the circuits!

51
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,607
Switching circuits.

52
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:29,898
Power supply being restored.

53
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,114
This is still the problem here, huh?

54
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,382
Yes, the fact that the conversion efficiency

55
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,186
is 0.008 lower than our
theoretical value concerns me.

56
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:42,888
It's just barely within tolerance, though,

57
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,356
but what do we do?

58
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,924
Let's try it again using the same configuration,

59
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:48,661
but lower the reciprocal
conversion rate by 0.01.

60
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:49,762
Roger.

61
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,897
Now, let's recommence the
reactivation experiment.

62
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,118
In The Still Darkness
Episode Eleven

63
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,961
Hey, hold up!

64
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,011
Man, that was a run!

65
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,853
You've certainly got a black expression.

66
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:16,374
It's from seeing your loathsome face
first thing in the morning.

67
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,130
Yes, please hold for just a moment.

68
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,674
What?

69
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,274
Um, Father...

70
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,041
What is it? Spit it out!
Um, Father...

71
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:36,832
What is it? Spit it out!

72
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,115
Well...

73
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,451
Actually today...

74
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,992
We were told to tell our parents...

75
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:55,181
...that they're having a career discussion
interview at school.

76
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:59,899
I've delegated all such things
to Captain Katsuragi.

77
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,739
Don't call me over such nonsense.

78
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,433
Don't forward any more of these calls to...

79
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:09,775
Oh?

80
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:10,843
A blackout?

81
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:13,094
No way. That's not possible.

82
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:17,149
That's strange. Do you suppose
there was an accident?

83
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,109
Maybe Akagi messed up an experiment?

84
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,077
The main power supply has been interrupted.

85
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,560
Voltage level is zero!

86
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,094
It wasn't me.

87
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,763
What do you think?

88
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:33,014
Well, it'll switch to the backup
power supply soon.

89
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,502
It's no good, the backup circuits
aren't connecting.

90
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,003
That can't be!

91
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,839
Which circuits are still functioning?

92
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,840
A total of one point two percent!
Only the old circuits from number 2567!

93
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:49,415
Route all remaining power supplies
to maintaining the Magi and Central Dogma.

94
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,184
But that will interfere with life support systems.

95
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,752
I don't care! That's our top priority!

96
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:53,853

102
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:04,582
Can't Captain Katsuragi at least
pick up her own laundry?

103
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:06,802
Press Button To Cross

104
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,317
What?

105
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:13,172
Maybe Commander lkari
was just really busy?

106
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:14,540
I don't know...

107
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:18,477
It wasn't like he hung up, but more like
a mechanical failure.

108
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,279
You know, you ARE a man.

109
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,859
Why don't you stop worrying
about every little detail?

110
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:29,912
What?

111
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,675
What are you doing? Here, let me try that!

112
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:44,315
Damn! It must be broken!

113
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,846
Anyway, let's hurry to the command center.

114
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,881
It's already been down for seven minutes!

115
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,716
This isn't normal.

116
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:58,918
What's the power system here?

117
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,587
There are three systems, main, sub, and reserve.

118
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,988
It's unthinkable that all three
would fail simultaneously.

119
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,159
Which means...

120
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,528
We should assume that the breakers
didn't fail on their own,

121
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,197
but were taken down on purpose.

122
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,432
Regardless of the cause,

123
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,923
it would be disastrous if an Angel
were to attack right now.

124
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,538
Radar has detected an unidentified object.

125
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,041
Projected landing point is in
the former Atami region.

Go to alert status for now.
That's the procedure, after all.

136
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:31,667
Go to alert status for now.
That's the procedure, after all.

137
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:36,355
This one's destination is going to be
New Tokyo-3 anyway.

138
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:36,989
I agree. Well, there's nothing we need to do.

139
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,459

It's still advancing.

145
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:50,336
What about New Tokyo-3?

146
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:52,338
Still no response.

147
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,529
What in the hell are those Nerv guys doing?

148
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:58,811
I thought gangway ladders were decorative
holdovers from the past.

149
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,280
Who'd have thought I'd be using one?

150
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,031
To prepare is to prevent.

151
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,188
This one doesn't work either!

152
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,857
None of the facilities work. This is odd.

153
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,859
Does that mean that something
happened down below?

154
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,560
It would be natural to assume that.

155
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:20,299
In any case, let's try to make contact
with Nerv Headquarters.

156
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,490
No good, the emergency phones aren't
getting through either.

157
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,022
No good, Line 77 won't connect either.

158
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,396
No, no response.

159
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:33,445
Not here either. The emergency
landline is down too.

160
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:34,736
What do we do now?

161
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,056
What're you doing?

162
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:47,393
What are you, stupid?
It's the emergency manual!

163
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,428
Anyway, let's go to headquarters.

164
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:53,348
Yeah, but first let's decide on a group leader
before we take action.

165
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,936
And naturally, I am the leader.

166
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:58,987
No objections,  assume?

167
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,117
Now, let's go.

168
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,919
We can get below through Route 07 over here.

169
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,196
But the doors won't work, will they?

170
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,950
Manual door...

171
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,291
Okay, Shinji, you're up.

172
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:20,653
Sheesh! You only rely on people
at times like this!

173
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,732
Damn those Joint Staff bastards!
They only rely on us at times like this.

174
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,168
What does the government say?

175
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,071
Those bastards in Tokyo-2?
They're apparently getting ready to run.

176
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:32,304
Beware of Forest Fires
Those bastards in Tokyo-2?
They're apparently getting ready to run.

177
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,295
Beware of Forest Fires

178
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,751
The Angel is still active and advancing.

179
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,813
In any case, get in contact with
the people at Nerv.

180
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,748
But how?

181
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,179
By actually going there.

182
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,921
This is the 3rd District ASDF!

183
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,491
An unidentified object is moving
toward this area.

184
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,927
All residents must evacuate
to their designated shelters.

185
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,708
Big trouble! I've got to report this
to Headquarters right away!

186
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,590
But how?

187
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,905
Remember Takahashi remains calm
even in situations like this!

188
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:10,409
Please support candidate Takahashi!

189
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,677
Lucky!

190
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:14,646
But you know, it sure is hot.

191
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,982
Yeah, the air conditioners are out too.

192
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:20,142
Katsuragi, if you're so hot,
why don't you take off your shirt?

193
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:23,121
There's no reason for shyness
between you and me.

194
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:28,427
Don't get any funny ideas just because
we're in this situation.

195
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:29,428
Okay, okay!

196
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:32,589
This is bad. Now the air is getting stagnant.

197
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,535
To think this facility represents the most
advanced technology on Earth...

198
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:39,171
But look at the Commander
and Vice Commander.

199
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:41,132
Even this heat isn't getting to them at all.

200
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,079
For Fire Prevention

201
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,615
It's lukewarm.

202
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:50,436
Yeah.

203
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:03,028
Pursuant to the declaration of a state
of emergency in this district,

204
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,063
Nozomu Takahashi
Pursuant to the declaration of a state
of emergency in this district,

205
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:05,464
Nozomu Takahashi
emergency vehicle, passing through!

206
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:07,199
emergency vehicle, passing through!

207
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,034
Excuse me, that's a dead end!

208
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,736
It's okay! Chargel!

209
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,504
This is an emergency, after all!

210
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,605
Roger!

211
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,536
No! Stop the car!

212
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:19,778
This Geo-Front was designed to be
a self-sufficient colony,

213
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:23,282
even when isolated from the outside.

214
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:27,353
Theoretically, it's impossible for all of
the power sources to fail at once.

215
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,622
Which means that someone
did it deliberately, correct?

216
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,325
Their purpose is likely to be
to investigate this facility.

217
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:36,528
So they could determine HQ's structure
through the progress of restoration?

218
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,109
Disrespectful bastards.

219
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,728
1"l run a dummy program through the Magi.

220
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,551
That will make it harder for them
to get a complete picture.

221
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:45,170
I'll leave it to you.

222
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:45,437
Yes, Sir.
I'll leave it to you.

223
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:46,405
Yes, Sir.

224
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,874
The first havoc wreaked upon our headquarters
wasn't caused by an Angel,

225
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,477
but by another member of our species.
Just goes to show.

226
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:55,228
Ultimately, the enemy of mankind is mankind.

227
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,176
This would normally take only two minutes.

228
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,953
Is this really a corridor?

229
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:03,794
Once we get over there, we should be able to
come out in the Geo-Front.

230
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:08,060
I've heard that from you four times already.

231
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,395
You really are a nitpicky man!

232
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,598
You're always focusing on the stupidest things.

233
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:13,599
Quiet.

234
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,400
What now, Miss Perfect?

235
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,511
Someone's voice.

236
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,087
Ang... ...proaching...

237
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,476
That's Mr. Hyuga!

238
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,317
Hey! Hey! Hey!

239
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,621
An Angel is approaching!
Repeat, an Angel is approaching!

240
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,453
An Angel is approaching?!

241
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:37,089
There's no time to waste. Let's take a short cut.

242
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,025
I'm the leader! Don't just take over!

243
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:41,606
So where's this short cut?

244
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,453
This may be the quickest way,
but we look really lame.

245
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,736
Say, what do you suppose the Angels are?

246
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,938
Why are you talking about that
at a time like this?

247
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:57,218
Angels, messengers of God, enemies named
after servants of Heaven.

248
00:12:58,578 --> 00:12:59,978
Why are we fighting them?

249
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,346
What are you, stupid?

250
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,815
Strange beings are attacking us.

251
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,566
If you're going through a fire, you've got to
brush away the embers, of course!

252
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:11,290
To the right!

253
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,091
I think it's left.

254
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,760
Oh, be quiet!

255
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,395
What do you think, Shinji?

256
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:17,356
Well...

257
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:20,699
I wonder?

258
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,300
Honestly! I'm the leader,
so just shut up and follow me!

259
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,442
I still think this is weird. We're going uphill.

260
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:33,313
What do you mean, you still think?
You're such a nag!

261
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,069
Look, this has got to be it this time!

262
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,404
Well, we've visually confirmed
the Angel's presence.

263
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,595
Now, we know we have to hurry.

264
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:08,847
Angel is approaching! Immediate Eva
dispatch will be necessary!

265
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:09,948
Oh, nol

266
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,783
Fuyutsuki, I'll leave the rest to you.

267
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:12,984
Ikari?

268
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:16,254
I'll start preparing for the Eva launch in the cage.

269
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,365
Don't tell me...

270
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,624
Manually?

271
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,560
There's an emergency diesel generator.

272
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:22,871
But...

273
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,244
We have no pilots.

274
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,137
Not again!

275
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:32,541
This way.

276
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:43,093
I've heard that you're
Commander lkari's favorite.

277
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:47,853
I guess being Miss Perfect,
the teacher's pet, really shows.

278
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,488
Let's not do this now.

279
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,629
You always get to look all smug.

280
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,670
Don't think that being favored means
that you can mess with me!

281
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:59,831
I'm not messing with you.

282
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,707
And I'm not favored either.

283
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,139
I know that quite well.

284
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,040
Heave hol Heave ho!

285
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,681
Roger.

286
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,384
Ejection of the terminal plug is complete.

287
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,454
Good, prepare to insert the entry plug
for all three units.

288
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,523
But the pilots aren't here yet.

289
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,574
Don't worry, they'll come without fail.

290
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:31,051
I can't open this with my hands.

291
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,618
It can't be helped. We'll have to break
into a duct to get through.

292
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,670
This First Child is scary!

293
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,981
She's the type who will do anything
to accomplish her objectives.

294
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,728
In other words, a self-righteous bitch.

295
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,139
The plug is fixed and ready.

296
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:57,155
Now, we just have to wait for the kids.

297
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:05,574
Don't you dare look forward!
If you do, I'll kill you!

298
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,900
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

299
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,702
Didn't I just say not to look?!

300
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:13,012
I couldn't help it! I've got to...

301
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,720
You guys!

302
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,981
All units, prepare for entry!

303
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,712
Roger, open the hatches manually.

304
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:26,448
How are the Evas?

305
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,493
They're in standby.

306
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,252
But nothing's working.

307
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:34,122
It was all done by hand.

308
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,895
It was the Commander's idea.

309
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:38,126
My father's?

310
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,930
Commander lkari had faith that you would come,
and prepared everything.

311
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:50,475
Flywheel, ready for connection!

312
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,110
All units, interior set.
Flywheel, ready for connection!

313
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:52,777
All units, interior set.
We're good! Run the cell motor!

314
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,238
We're good! Run the cell motor!

315
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,987
Plugs inserted.

316
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:04,522
All units activated using backup power supply.

317
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,424
Release the primary lock bolts.

318
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,632
Hydraulic locks numbers 2
through 32, released.

319
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,833
Zero pressure.

320
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:15,854
The situation is free.

321
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:20,438
Go ahead. Each unit, force open the restraints
under your own power.

322
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,459
Head out!

323
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,153
The target appears to have halted
directly above us!

324
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:45,954
Get ready! Hurry up!

325
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:50,302
The emergency batteries have been loaded!

326
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:51,803
All right, we can do this!

327
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:52,824
Launch!

328
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,615
Geez! This is SO uncool!

329
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:04,876
We're approaching the vertical shaft.

330
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:16,276
This is still uncool.

331
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,661
Watch out! Dodge!

332
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,371
No!

333
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:10,115
It appears the target is going to invade HQ
using a powerful liquid solvent.

334
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:10,949
What'll we do?

335
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,251
We're going to beat it, of course.

336
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,953
Sure, but how?

337
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:18,790
We dropped our rifles, and the battery
packs are running out.

338
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,431
They won't last more than another three minutes.

339
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,294
I have a plan.

340
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,430
The one who stays here will be defense.

341
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:27,132
Their job is to neutralize the AT Field,

342
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,367
and to protect the offensive player
from the liquid solvent.

343
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:33,905
The backup player will go down, pick up
the rifles, and hand them to the offense.

344
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:36,716
The offense will then fire a volley
to destroy the target.

345
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,910
Does that sound good?

346
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,712
Fine. I will take the defense.

347
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:41,883
Sorry, but it's not you.

348
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:43,615
Il do it.

349
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,076
No way! It's dangerous!

350
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,952
That's why.

351
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:51,823
I don't want to stay indebted to you
from last time.

352
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:54,074
Shinji's on offense. Miss Perfect is the backup.

353
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,580
Got it?

354
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,128
Understood.

355
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,566
Okay, here we go!

356
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:04,839
Gehen!

357
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:26,414
Ayanami!

358
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,254
Asuka, get out of the way!

359
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,910
Now we're even.

360
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:51,182
Oh, damn it! Why won't it open?!

361
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,118
This is an emergency!

362
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,698
I've gotta go!

363
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,691
Hey, I told you not to look up!

364
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:00,862
Yeah, yeah...

365
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,534
Disgusting...

366
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:22,247
It's ironic that the stars are so beautiful

367
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:26,050
when there's no electricity or artificial lights.

368
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:29,181
But without the lights, it doesn't feel
like anyone lives there.

369
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,361
See? I feel much more comfortable this way.

370
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:40,932
Man has always feared the darkness,
carving away at it with fire.

371
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,694
How philosophical!

372
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:47,607
Is that what makes mankind a special species?

373
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:51,075
Is that why the Angels keep attacking us?

374
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:52,777
What are you, stupid?

375
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,968
There's no way to know that.

376
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:00,735
To Be Continued

377
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:07,292
Previewy

378
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:10,989
Misato sublimates her frustration
into destroying the Angels.

379
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,290
A past is revealed.

380
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:15,260
However, the largest Angel yet,
flying in from the stratosphere,

381
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:17,395
causes people to abandon hope.
