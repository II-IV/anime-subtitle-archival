15
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:35,193
Mom! Mom! I've been chosen!

16
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,896
I'm an elite pilot, chosen to
protect all of mankind!

17
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:39,478
I'm the best in the world!

18
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,368
It's supposed to be a secret!

19
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,209
But I'll tell you anyway! Just for you!

20
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,573
Everyone will be nice to us from now on!

21
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,274
So, we won't be lonely anymore!

22
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,694
So, we'll be fine, even without Dad around!
We won't be lonely anymore!

23
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,848
So, look! Look at me!

24
00:01:58,018 --> 00:01:59,218
Come on, Mom!

25
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,026
I don't want to hear any more
of that garbage from youl!

26
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,394
You're just stupid anyway, Shiniji!

27
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:12,905
How many times do I have to tell you?!
Kaji's gone!

28
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:14,974
You're lying!

29
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:23,746
Synch rate, zero...

30
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,213
Not qualified to be the Second Child...

31
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:29,204
There's no reason for me to exist anymore.

32
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,351
Because no one will look at me now.

33
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,962
Not Dad, not Mom, not anyone.

34
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,005
There's no reason for me to live now.

35
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,635
Asuka Langley Sohryu, correct?

36
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,736
Intelligence Division 2 reports that they have
the Second Child safely in their custody.

37
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:54,807
I see.

38
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:58,710
It isn't like Division 2 to take seven days to
find her on top of losing her in the first place.

39
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,546
It's probably on purpose.

40
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:03,281
Maybe they're trying to spite us
here in the Tactical Division.

41
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,393
Possibly.

42
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:08,587
And today, Asuka's replacement,
the Fifth Child, arrives.

43
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,138
Everything is just too perfect.

44
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:19,575
Rei Ayanami...

45
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,640
So, that feeling I got really was her.

46
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,487
Like Mother...

47
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,809
Rei Ayanami and Mother...

48
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:31,119
What are you doing, Father?

49
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,630
Commander Ikari...

50
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:36,952
The cat died.

51
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,286
The one I'd left in my grandmother's care.

52
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,488
I hadn't paid any attention to her for so long,

53
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,099
but now, suddenly, I'll never see her again.

54
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,323
Why did you destroy the dummy system?

55
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,130
Not the dummy system,
what I destroyed was Rei.

56
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,891
I will only ask you this once. Why?

57
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,940
Because I am no longer happy,
even when you make love to me.

58
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,209
Why don't you just have your way
with my body?!

59
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,477
Like you did that time!

60
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,378
I'm disappointed in you.

61
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,713
Disappointed?!

62
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,448
You never hoped or expected anything
from me to begin with!

63
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,290
Nothing from me! Not anything! Nothing!

64
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,683
What am I supposed to do, Mother?

65
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,665
I wonder where Asuka is?

66
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,783
But what would be the point in seeing her?

67
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,414
Talk to her about Ayanami or something?

68
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:46,068
Everyone, including Toji and Kensuke,
lost their homes and left.

69
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,081
My friends...

70
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:52,106
I don't have anyone I can
call a friend anymore.

71
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,283
There's no one.

72
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,163
I can't go see Ayanami.

73
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:59,131
I don't have the courage for it.

74
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,092
I don't know how I'm supposed to face her.

75
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:05,406
Asuka, Miss Misato, Mother...

76
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:07,863
What should I...

77
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,840
What should I do?

78
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:31,593
Singing is great.

79
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,058
Singing enriches the soul.

80
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,055
It's the crowning achievement of the
civilization that the Lilim created.

81
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,464
Don't you feel the same?

82
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:41,907
Shinji Ikari?

83
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:43,742
My name...

84
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,611
Everyone knows your name.

85
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:46,946
I don't mean to be rude,

86
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:50,049
but I think you should be a little more
aware of your position.

87
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,190
You think so?

88
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,385
Who are you?

89
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,316
I'm Kaworu, Kaworu Nagisa.

90
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:58,190
One of the children that's part of
the design, just like you.

91
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,725
I'm the Fifth Child.

92
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,227
The Fifth Child?

93
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,218
You are? Nagisa?

94
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:06,265
You can just call me Kaworu, Ikari.

95
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,696
You can call me Shinji too.

96
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,059
It appears the Fifth Child has just arrived.

97
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,432
Kaworu Nagisa, his past records
have already been erased.

98
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,779
The same as Rei...

99
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,650
But the one thing we do know is that his
birthday coincides with the Second Impact.

100
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:27,119
The Committee sent him directly to us.

101
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,121
There's bound to be something to this.

102
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:32,858
In the Marduk Report, the matter of the Fifth
Child is also designated as confidential.

103
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:36,695
So, I did a little hacking into the
Intelligence Department's database.

104
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,664
You’re so reckless!

105
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,125
It was worth it though.

106
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,167
I found out where Miss Ritsuko's being held.

107
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,971
How do you want to go about the
Fifth Child's synch test?

108
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,007
Let's hold off on the trick questions today

109
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:51,176
and get a straight reading
on what he's capable of.

110
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,727
Fixing graph depth.

111
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,247
Try lowering it another point three.

112
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,098
Yes, Sir.

113
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,952
Are these data readouts accurate?

114
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:02,955
All instrumentation is operating normally, Sir.

115
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,925
The Magi have not detected
any errors in the data, Sir.

116
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,927
Who would have expected that he would
synchronize with Unit 02

117
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,595
without the core being reconfigured?

118
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,796
This boy...

119
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,898
But this is beyond belief!

120
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,634
This should be impossible, given the system.

121
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,403
Nevertheless, these are the facts.

122
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:20,334
First, accept the facts for what they are,
and then investigate the why behind them.

123
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:25,974
Central Dogma is currently locked down.
Please use Route 22 as a detour.

124
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,399
You're the First Child, aren't you?

125
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,240
Rei Ayanami...

126
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,279
You're the same as me.

127
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:38,557
So, both of us ended up in
the same form as the Lilim

128
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,578
while we inhabit this planet.

129
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:42,418
Who are you?

130
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,765
It seems the Fifth Child has
made contact with Rei.

131
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:47,900
I see.

132
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,401
The Magi are currently pouring
all their resources

133
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,132
into analyzing the data we got
from the Fifth Child.

134
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:54,123
And yet, we still have no idea what he is.

135
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:56,742
Who in the world is that boy?

136
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:58,033
Do not enter without permission.
1'll kill you if you come without asking!

137
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,604
Shiniji still hasn't returned either.

138
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,327
I've failed as a guardian.

139
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,127
Central Dogma is currently open.

140
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,329
Please use Route 3 to transfer.

141
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,289
Hi, were you waiting for me?

142
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,369
No, not really. That's not what I was...

143
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,570
What are you doing today?

144
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:27,373
Well, the regular tests are over,

145
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,454
so all I have left is to take a shower
and go home, but...

146
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:33,527
But the truth is, lately, I don't
really want to go home.

147
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,814
A place to return to...

148
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:38,717
The fact that you have a home
will lead to your happiness.

149
00:08:38,717 --> 00:08:39,952
It's a very good thing.

150
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,186
You think so?

151
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,057
I'd like to talk more with you.

152
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,870
May I come with you?

153
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,146
To take a shower. You still need
to go take one, right?

154
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,063
Is that a no?

155
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:53,404
Oh, no, that's not what I meant.

156
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,483
You go to such extremes to avoid first contact.

157
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,745
Are you afraid of connecting with other people?

158
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,281
If you don't get close to others,

159
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,417
you'll never be betrayed and
you'll never hurt each other.

160
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:14,887
But you'll also never be able
to forget your loneliness.

161
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:18,023
Humans can never banish
their loneliness for good,

162
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,604
because being human means being alone.

163
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,394
But humans are able to go on with their lives

164
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,175
because they're able to forget it every so often.

165
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,006
It's time.

166
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,607
Is it over already?

167
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,810
Yeah, we better go to bed.

168
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:38,661
Together?

169
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:42,748
Oh, no! I think there's probably
a room ready for you.

170
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,416
A separate one.

171
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,497
I see.

172
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,339
Humans constantly feel pain in their hearts.

173
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:54,157
Because the heart is so sensitive to pain,
humans also feel that to live is to suffer.

174
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:59,465
You're so delicate, like glass,
especially your heart.

175
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:00,432
Me?

176
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,163
Yes, you have my regard for it.

177
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,470
Regard?

178
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:05,461
It means, I love you.

179
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:06,692
Episode Twenty-Four

180
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,613
The Final
Messenger

181
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:17,716
Nerv, the organization formed to be
Seele's executive branch...

182
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:21,487
It was created in order to put
our script into practice.

183
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:25,290
But now, it has become an organization
in the possession of one individual.

184
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,327
Precisely, we must take it back.

185
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,162
Before the promised day.

186
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:33,932
Nerv and the Eva series must be
in their true forms.

187
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:37,413
Ikari, you will bear the responsibility of
your malfeasance towards Seele.

188
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:41,655
The time that has been given to us runs short.

189
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:46,259
But the Lance of Longinus that stood
in the way of our desire is no more.

190
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,848
Soon, the final Angel will appear.

191
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,217
If we destroy it, our wish will come true.

192
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,858
Just a little longer, Yui.

193
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,769
Why am [ here?

194
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,505
Why am I alive again?

195
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,002
For what?

196
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,395
And for whom?

197
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,193
The Fifth Child... That boy...

198
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,806
I feel as if he's the same as me.

199
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:13,622
Why?

200
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:22,181
I'm glad we're on the outskirts of the city,

201
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,142
because it kept you safe from all that.

202
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:27,338
But there's no guarantee that will be
the case next time.

203
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:31,690
So, the Horaki family will be taking care
of you starting tomorrow.

204
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,861
This will be goodbye for a while, Pen Pen.

205
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:44,403
Come on, I'll sleep on the floor.

206
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:45,404
It's okay.

207
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,773
You're the one who's doing me a favor
by letting me stay over.

208
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:49,064
I'm fine where I am.

209
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,715
What do you want to talk about?

210
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,389
There are things you want me to hear, right?

211
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,590
All sorts of things have happened
since I came here.

212
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,733
Before coming here, I used
to live with my teacher.

213
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:09,714
The days were peaceful.
Nothing ever happened.

214
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,160
I only had to exist there.

215
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:16,982
But that was okay, because there
was nothing I had to do.

216
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,138
Did you hate people?

217
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,175
Not really, I think it didn't matter,
one way or another.

218
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,226
But I did hate my father.

219
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,256
Why am I telling Kaworu all this?

220
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,729
Maybe I was born, so that I would meet you.

221
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,628
Humans cannot create anything
out of nothingness.

222
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:45,897
Humans cannot accomplish anything
without holding onto something.

223
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,038
After all, humans are not gods.

224
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:52,811
But there is one man who is trying to
obtain power equal to that of God.

225
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,375
There is a man, who is not one of us,

226
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,305
attempting to open Pandora's Box once again.

227
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:01,680
There is a man trying to close the Box

228
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,821
before the Hope at the bottom appears.

229
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,852
Hope?

230
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:09,221
You're saying that is the Lilim's hope?

231
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:12,658
Hope exists in as many forms
as there are people.

232
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:16,561
And that is because hope only exists
in the hearts of people.

233
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,492
However, our hope is becoming substantiated.

234
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,802
That is Lilith, the progenitor of mankind

235
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:27,339
who are the false successors
from the black moon.

236
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,375
And Adam, the progenitor of the Angels

237
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:34,379
who are the true successors
from the lost white moon.

238
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,183
His salvaged soul exists only within you.

239
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:42,788
However, his resurrected body
already exists within Ikari.

240
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,429
Shinji's father...

241
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,601
So, he is also the same as me.

242
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,620
That is why we entrust you with our wish.

243
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:56,975
I know. That's why I'm here now after all.

244
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:02,562
It's no good. I can't read his lips from here.

245
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,477
But he certainly is a shady character,

246
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:08,438
going out for a walk so early
in the morning to talk to himself.

247
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,344
He noticed me?

248
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,860
No, it's not possible.

249
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,328
All will be as the Lilim direct it.

250
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,175
How did it go? Did you get any data on him?

251
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,998
Here it is.

252
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,334
I borrowed it from First Lieutenant
Ibuki without her permission.

253
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,375
I'm sorry  keep making you do
these theft-like things.

254
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,706
What is this?!

255
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,042
It's no wonder Maya can't release
this information.

256
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,710
It's all theoretically impossible data.

257
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,180
You're right. It only deepens the mystery.

258
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:45,684
To think that he can freely set
his synch rate with the Eva...

259
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,719
And of his own will at that.

260
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,800
I guess this is yet again no time to be
worried about appearances.

261
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,091
I'm surprised you made it in.

262
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,060
There's something I want to ask you.

263
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,229
All conversations in here
are recorded, you know.

264
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,663
I don't care.

265
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,274
Just who is that boy? The Fifth Child?

266
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,575
He is likely the final messenger.

267
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,206
Come on, let's go.

268
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:11,077
Come with me, Adam's alter ego
and servant of the Lilim.

269
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,718
Eva Unit 02 is activating!

270
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,853
That's impossible! Where's Asuka?

271
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,556
In med room 303! It's been confirmed!

272
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:25,857
Then who in the world is...

273
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,818
It's unmanned! No entry plug
is present in Unit 02!

274
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:32,192
There's no one? It's not the Fifth Child?

275
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,301
A developing AT Field has been
detected in Central Dogmal

276
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:37,235
Is that Unit 027!

277
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,670
No, its pattern is blue!

278
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:39,931
There's no doubt about it! It's an Angel!

279
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,229
What did you say?!

280
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:44,422
An Angel? That boy?

281
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:49,815
Target has passed through Level 4
and is still descending!

282
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:52,083
It's no good! We can't cut the power
to the linear carriage!

283
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,819
Target has passed through Level 5!

284
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,189
Emergency lockdown! Close all
partitions in Central Dogmal!

285
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,530
Buy us some time, no matter how little.

286
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,060
Emergency lockdown, all Malebolge
levels being closed.

287
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,931
All personnel, evacuate.
All personnel, evacuate.

288
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:08,433
I never imagined Seele would
send one directly to us.

289
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:11,743
The old men intend to step up
the schedule by forcing our hand.

290
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:17,776
Humans forget their foolishness
and repeat their mistakes.

291
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:21,313
If humans do not redeem themselves willingly,
they will not change.

292
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,748
We will not rely on the powers
of Adam or the Angels.

293
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,352
Our only choice is to make changes
with our own hands for the future.

294
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,433
I will be praying that Unit 01
will accomplish its task.

295
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:35,093
Unit 02 is breaking through
the armored partitions!

296
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,429
Target has passed through Cocytus 2!

297
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,431
Send Eva Unit 01 after it.

298
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:40,265
Yes, Sir.

299
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:44,075
Stop it from invading Terminal Dogma
at all costs.

300
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,642
But why did the Angel take Unit 02?

301
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:53,378
Could it be planning to merge with Unit 02?

302
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,914
Or possibly to bring about destruction.

303
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,549
It's a lie! A lie! A lie!

304
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,552
That Kaworu is... He's an Angel?!

305
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:02,254
That's a lie!

306
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:04,155
It's a fact. Accept it.

307
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,205
Move out, understood?

308
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,829
Shinji's so late.

309
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,932
Eva Unit 01 heading down Route 2!

310
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,163
In pursuit of target!

311
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:19,271
You betrayed me! You betrayed my feelings!

312
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,081
You betrayed me, just like Father did!

313
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,375
Unit 01 has reached Level 4.

314
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,745
Coming into contact with the target!

315
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,484
There he is!

316
00:17:27,512 --> 00:17:29,247
I've been waiting for you, Shiniji.

317
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,098
Kaworu!

318
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,851
Asuka, sorry!

319
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:41,359
The Eva series.

320
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,696
Born from Adam, they are an abhorrent
existence for humans.

321
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:47,699
And the Lilim will even use them
in order to survive.

322
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,900
I can't understand.

323
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:54,401
Kaworu, stop this! Why?!

324
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,418
The Eva are made of the same body as I am.

325
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,779
Because I am born from Adam as well.

326
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,348
I could merge with them,
if only they didn't have souls.

327
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:06,479
Unit 02's soul has shut itself away for now.

328
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,755
An AT Field!

329
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,792
That's right. That's what you Lilim call it.

330
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:16,895
The sacred domain where none may trespass.

331
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,630
The light of the soul.

332
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,732
Lilim, you know, don't you?

333
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:24,269
That the AT Field is the wall that
everyone has in their heart?

334
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,020
I don't know anything about that, Kaworu!

335
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,076
Both Eva units have reached the lowest level.

336
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:33,387
Target distance to Terminal Dogma, 20.

337
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,583
If Unit O1's signal disappears
and another change occurs...

338
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:42,253
I know. We set this place to self-destruct, right?

339
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,190
It'll be better than letting them
set off the Third Impact.

340
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:46,558
I'm sorry.

341
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,394
It's okay, as long as I'm with you.

342
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,245
Thank you.

343
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,437
The fate of man...

344
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,389
The hope of man is written in sorrow.

345
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,209
What's going on?!

346
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,778
It's an AT Field of unprecedented power!

347
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,580
Light, electromagnetic, and particle waves!

348
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:10,915
It's blocking them all! We can't
monitor anything in there!

349
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,384
We're truly sealed off.

350
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:15,587
We've lost the target along with
Eva Unit 01 and Unit 02!

351
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,368
We can't contact the pilot!

352
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,051
Kaworu!

353
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,243
Wait!

354
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,554
The final safety has been released!

355
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,605
Heaven's Door is opening!

356
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,828
So, an Angel has finally reached it.

357
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,415
Hyuga...

358
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:03,968
What's that?!

359
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,070
What's the situation?

360
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:06,438
It's an AT Field!

361
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:08,440
The same kind of AT Field that we saw earlier

362
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:11,176
has developed near the barrier
around Terminal Dogmal!

363
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:13,278
It's entering the barrier!

364
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,246
It can't be! Another Angel?!

365
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,781
It's no good! We can't confirm that!

366
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,802
Oh, no, it disappeared!

367
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,101
Disappeared?! The Angel did?!

368
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,896
Adam, our mother.

369
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:30,528
Must all who were born of Adam
return to Adam?

370
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,399
Even at the cost of destroying humanity?

371
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,208
No! This is...

372
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:37,368
Lilith?

373
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,539
I see, so that's what this is about, Lilim.

374
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,253
Thank you, Shiniji.

375
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,504
 wanted you to stop Unit 02.

376
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,726
Otherwise, I may have gone on living with her.

377
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,507
Kaworu, why?

378
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:05,964
Because it's my destiny to continue to live

379
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:08,925
even if it may result in the
destruction of humanity.

380
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,704
But I can also die here.

381
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:15,306
Life and death are of equal value to me.

382
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:16,841
Dying of your own will.

383
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,110
That is the one and only absolute
freedom there is.

384
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,311
What?

385
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:24,149
Kaworu, I don't understand
what you're saying!

386
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,170
Kaworu...

387
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:27,178
My last will and testament.

388
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,399
Now, erase me from this world.

389
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,230
If you don't, you will be
the ones who are erased.

390
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:37,866
Only one life form will be chosen to survive
the time of destruction and be given a future.

391
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:41,925
And you are not a being who should die.

392
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,993
Your people need the future.

393
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:55,283
Thank you. I'm glad I met you.

394
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:27,525
Kaworu said that he loved me.

395
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:31,899
It was...

396
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,701
It was the first time someone
told me they loved me.

397
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,702
He was like me, and like Ayanami.

398
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,018
I loved him.

399
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:47,547
Kaworu was the one who should have survived.

400
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:51,694
He was a much better person than I am.

401
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:56,156
Kaworu should have been the one to survive.

402
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,003
You're wrong.

403
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,813
Only those who have the will to live
get to survive.

404
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:05,176
He wished to die.

405
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:08,337
He abandoned his will to live,
clinging instead to a false hope.

406
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,031
You did nothing wrong, Shinji.

407
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,442
You're cold, Miss Misato.

408
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:15,993
To Be Continued

409
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:47,612
Preview

410
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:49,781
Shinji defeated the final angel,

411
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:53,384
but unable to deal with reality,
he shuts the world out.

412
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,720
And the promised time comes.

413
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,789
The impending annihilation of Nerv.

414
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,824
Asuka is driven to the brink of death.

415
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:03,127
The Human Instrumentality Project is
about to be activated along with Rei.

416
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:06,130
Over the heads of the people rebelling
against their own reality

417
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,599
and feeding their dreams,
the Eva series descends

418
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,269
as if mocking the deception that
is about to be uncovered.

419
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,700
Next time: “Air”

420
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:14,662
Next Time
