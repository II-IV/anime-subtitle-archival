1
00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:06,435
Just like the cruel angel

2
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:14,114
Young boy, become a legend

3
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:28,223
Even though the untested breeze
taps at the door to your heart

4
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:36,523
You just look solely at me and smile

5
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:43,005
So intent on seeking out that gentle touch

6
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:51,001
Such innocent eyes, still ignorant
of their destiny

7
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:57,992
But someday, you are sure to realize
that upon your back

8
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,910
You have the wings with which to fly
towards the distant future

9
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:11,137
The cruel angel's thesis

10
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:14,874
Soon, you will take flight from the windowsill

11
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:18,610
With your torrent of ardent pathos

12
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:22,348
If you are to betray our memories

13
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:25,985
You, who embrace these heavens and shine

14
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:29,266
Young boy, become a legend

15
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,214
Katsuragi, it's me.

16
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:39,693
I've probably put you through a lot of trouble
by the time you're listening to this.

17
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,401
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,072
Tell Ritchan I said I'm sorry too.

19
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,905
Also, since I've troubled you
so much anyway,

20
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,637
there's this flower I've been growing...

21
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,232
I1t'd make me happy if you'd water it for me.

22
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,725
Shinji knows where it is.

23
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:56,991
Katsuragi, the truth is with you.

24
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,440
Go forward without any hesitation.

25
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,623
If I ever get to see you again,

26
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:05,737
I'll say the words I wasn't able
to say eight years ago.

27
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,783
Bye.

28
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,367
The phone that won't ring...

29
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,465
Sorry, but don't
bother me.
Working

30
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:19,183
Miss Misato's still cooped up today.

31
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,913
Do not enter without permission.
If you do,
1"l kill you!

32
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:26,078
Asuka...

33
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,949
I wonder if she won't be coming
back again today?

34
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,657
She won't go to school and
she won't go back home.

35
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,080
She just keeps playing games.

36
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,097
Hikari?

37
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,400
What is it?

38
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:48,631
Wanna go to sleep?

39
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:50,256
Okay...

40
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,144
I'm sorry. Am I a bother?

41
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:12,671
No, not at all.

42
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:19,677
 wasn't able to win in my Eva.

43
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,369
I'm not worth anything anymore.

44
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,510
Not anywhere.

45
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:29,333
I hate it. I hate it all. I hate everyone.

46
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:33,584
But what I hate the most is myself.

47
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:37,058
Somehow, I feel like nothing matters anymore.

48
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:43,289
I think it's okay for you to do whatever
you want and I won't say anything,

49
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,340
because I think you did your best, Asuka.

50
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:00,455
I see, so she passed away.

51
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,311
Yes, probably, even cats eventually
reach the end of their lives.

52
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,217
Don't cry anymore, Grandma.

53
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,392
I will. When I get some time,
I'l come home for a bit.

54
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,402
I haven't visited Mother's grave
in three years either.

55
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,156
I'll call you next time.

56
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:20,454
Okay, I'm hanging up now.

57
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,974
So, she died.

58
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,530
Episode Twenty-Three
Tears

59
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:34,006
It is impossible for us to recover
the Lance of Longinus.

60
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,574
Why did you use it?

61
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,705
We still do not have the planned number
of the Eva series.

62
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,181
I made destroying the Angel my first priority.

63
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:43,849
It was an unavoidable situation.

64
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,718
Unavoidable, was it?

65
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:48,888
You should make your excuses
more convincing than that.

66
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,049
Your recent actions have become intolerable.

67
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,917
Fuyutsuki, we're in the middle
of deliberations here.

68
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,208
All right.

69
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,401
An Angel is currently drawing near.

70
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,136
Let us continue this at another time.

71
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,627
If your seat is still waiting for you, that is.

72
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,545
Ikari... Does he intend to betray Seele?

73
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,747
I'll be there in fifteen minutes.

74
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:18,118
Launch Unit 00 from Number 32.
Send Unit 02 as backup.

75
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,154
That's right, Commander lkari's orders
still stand for Unit 01.

76
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,790
I don't have the authority to lift
the suspension on it.

77
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:25,751
Bye.

78
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,471
Visual confirmation of the Angel...

79
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,486
Unit 00 launched, heading for intercept point.

80
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,537
Unit 02 on standby at current location.

81
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,039
No, launch her.

82
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,106
Commander!

83
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,387
It doesn't matter. She can at least
serve as a decoy.

84
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:45,244
Yes, Sir.

85
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:46,885
Eva Unit 02, prepare for launch.

86
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,416
Here I am, shamelessly back in the pilot's seat.

87
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,785
I'm so bad at letting things go.

88
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,687
Unit 02, please go to Gate 8.

89
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,878
Launch as soon as your deployment
position has been determined.

90
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,604
Il only be in the way, even if I go out there.

91
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:04,897
Target approaching. It has crossed
the Gora Final Line of Defense.

92
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,508
I don't care anymore.

93
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,558
Target hovering over Ohwakudani,
continuing to rotate in place.

94
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,580
Target's AT Field is still active.

95
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,049
What were you doing?

96
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,551
I won't waste time on excuses.

97
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:26,652
What's the situation?

98
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,821
We've been in a persistent deadlock.

99
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:32,224
Pattern cycling from blue to orange!

100
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,292
What does that mean?

101
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,694
Magi indicates it cannot find a solution.

102
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,430
We don't have enough data
to come to an answer.

103
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,121
But one thing's certain.
That shape isn't a fixed form.

104
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,955
So we can't make the first move.

105
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,306
Rei, we're going to wait and watch for a while.

106
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:48,357
No, it's coming.

107
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,313
Rei, counter it!

108
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:56,044
It's no use! She won't make it in time!

109
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,325
Target is in physical contact with Unit 00!

110
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:08,294
How is Unit 00's AT Field?!

111
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:11,430
Operational, but the Angel is eroding it!

112
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,900
The Angel is aggressively seeking
to make first contact?

113
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,011
With Unit 00?

114
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,444
Danger!

115
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,980
It's invading Unit 00's organic parts!

116
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,748
Launch Eva Unit 02!

117
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,479
Send her to rescue and back up Reil

118
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,057
Target making further inroads!

119
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:39,091
This is dangerous.

120
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:41,671
Over five percent has been
biologically fused already.

121
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:50,769
Asuka, close your distance by 300,
deploy your AT Field at maximum,

122
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,972
and fire the Palette Gun into the target's rear!

123
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,433
Got it? Eva Unit 02, lift off!

124
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:01,180
Move out, Asuka. What's the matter?
What's wrong with Unit 02?!

125
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,615
It's no good! The synch rate
is in the single digits!

126
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:04,256
Asuka!

127
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:09,016
It won't move. It just won't move!

128
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,924
She'll only be a sitting duck out there!

129
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,445
Bring her back! Quickly!

130
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,104
Who's there?

131
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,438
Me?

132
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,959
The me inside the Eva.

133
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,359
No, I can sense that there's
someone other than me.

134
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,846
Who are you?

135
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,567
An Angel? The person that we call an Angel?

136
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,219
Won't you become one with me?

137
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,030
No. I am me. I am not you.

138
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,487
I see, but it's no use. It's too late now.

139
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:52,926
I'll share what's in my heart with you.

140
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,313
I'll share this feeling with you.

141
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:01,778
Doesn't it hurt? See?
Doesn't your heart ache?

142
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,992
Hurt? No, you're wrong. It's...

143
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,247
...loneliness?

144
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,888
Yes, it's loneliness, isn't it?

145
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,160
Loneliness? I don't understand.

146
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,634
You hate being alone, don't you?

147
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:20,433
There are so many of us, and yet,
you hate being alone.

148
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,321
That is what loneliness is.

149
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:26,465
That is what is inside your heart.

150
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:29,946
That is your own heart, overflowing with sorrow.

151
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,876
These are tears?

152
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:37,391
The one crying is me?

153
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:43,816
Rei!

154
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:47,486
The suspension on Unit 01
has been lifted as of now.

155
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:48,717
Send him out immediately.

156
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,457
Send him out.

157
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,478
Yes, Sir.

158
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,961
What? You didn't send him out for me.

159
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,211
Deploy your AT Field. Rescue Rei immediately.

160
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:13,232
Okay!

161
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,058
Ikari?

162
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,434
Shinji, attack it with the Prog Knife!

163
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,204
It hurts.

164
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,045
It hurts, Ikari.

165
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:49,452
This is my heart wanting to
become one with Ikari?

166
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,334
No.

167
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:58,790
The AT Field has been reversed!

168
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,325
It will be eroded away at once!

169
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,936
Does she intend to contain the Angel?!

170
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,374
The Field has reached its limit!

171
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,342
The core will not be able to
maintain it at this rate!

172
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,272
Rei, abandon the Eva and get out of there!

173
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,246
No.

174
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,087
If I go, the AT Field will disappear.

175
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,373
So, l can't.

176
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:30,829
Rei, do you mean to die?

177
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,567
The core is collapsing!
Critical point exceeded!

178
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,800
Target has been destroyed.

179
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,738
At this time, this operation is officially over.

180
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:21,240
Change our status to Class One Alert.

181
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,243
Roger that. Switching immediately
to Condition Yellow.

182
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,410
What about Unit 00's status?

183
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,447
Ejection of the entry plug
has not been confirmed.

184
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:31,016
Hurry the rescue operation for the survivor.

185
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,357
If there is one, that is.

186
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,305
No antibiotic substance from the 16th Angel
has been found thus far.

187
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:53,772
We will continue searching.

188
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,374
Level C traces are spreading
towards the southwest.

Level C traces are spreading
towards the southwest.
Dr. Akagi!

191
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:57,670
Dr. Akagi!

192
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,147
What happened here will be
classified top secret.

193
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:05,450
Take back the plug. Dispose of everything else.

194
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,385
Roger that.

195
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:08,055
Let's get to work! Quickly!

196
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:08,690

the 16th Angel.

210
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:12,524
The 8th Angel

211
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:12,758
That leaves only one Angel described
in Seele's Dead Sea Scrolls.

212

228
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:17,029
The 14th Angel
That leaves only one Angel described
in Seele's Dead Sea Scrolls.

229
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,262
The promised time is near.

230
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:17,529
Zeruel
The promised time is near.

231
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:17,763
The 15th Angel
The promised time is near.

232
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:18,030
The promised time is near.

233
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:18,263
Ariel
The promised time is near.

234
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:18,530
The 16th Angel
The promised time is near.

235
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:18,764
The promised time is near.

236
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:18,965
Armisael
The promised time is near.

237
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:22,979
Our journey has been long and the
sacrifices have been great.

238
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,204
Indeed, first, the Lance of Longinus,

239
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,340
and now, the loss of Unit 00.

240
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:31,510
We have more than enough reasons
to relieve lkari of his command.

241
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,578
That man is smart enough
to know the significance

242
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,514
of why we allowed Fuyutsuki to return safely.

243
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:39,418
We need another human sacrifice
to counter lkari.

244
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,669
And we need someone who knows the truth.

245
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,537
Shinji, I'm coming in.

246
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:17,654
Miss Misato, the tears won't come.

247
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:22,145
I feel sad, but the tears just won't come.

248
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:28,653
Shiniji, this is about all I can
do for you right now.

249
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,970
Stop it!

250
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,261
Stop it, Miss Misato.

251
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,730
I'm sorry.

252
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,307
But he must be feeling lonely.

253
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,873
Is he afraid of women?

254
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:48,531
No, he's afraid of being intimate with people.

255
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,164
Pen Pen, come here.

256
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,563
I see, it doesn't matter who.

257
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,899
I am the one who is lonely.

258
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:08,734
Rei...

259
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:12,002
She is the product of my despair
and at the same time,

260
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,911
the vessel of your hope even now.

261
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:20,283
In the end, I suppose it was unreasonable
to expect you to forget.

262
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,194
Yes, hello?

263
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,734
What did you say?!

264
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:36,735
Shinji!

265
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:39,805
Dr. Godai of Internal Medicine 1, Dr. Godai.

266
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,886
Please contact Conference Room 2 immediately.

267
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:44,228
Ayanami!

268
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:49,147
Neurosurgery 1
Surgery 3 2nd Floor Ward
Diagnostic Radiology
X-ray Information Desk

269
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,338
I'm so glad you're okay.

270
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,391
I guess my dad's not here.

271
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,291
Thank you for saving me.

272
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,759
What do you mean?

273
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,710
What do I mean? You sacrificed
Unit 00 to save me.

274
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:08,300
I see, so I saved you.

275
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,602
Yeah, you don't remember?

276
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:12,032
No, I just don't know.

277
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:15,279
Because I think I'm probably the third one.

278
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:19,761
Ayanami

279
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,154
These are tears?

280
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,814
This should be the first time I've seen them,

281
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:57,515
but I feel like this isn't the first time.

282
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,051
Am l crying?

283
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,199
Why am I crying?

284
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,692
That's right. The First Child will be
maintained in her current condition.

285
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,895
There is no need for new restrictions.

286
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,364
The same goes for the Second and the Third.

287
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,595
They only need to be watched.

288
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,079
But Chairman Kiel and the rest will raise
a fuss when they learn that Rei is alive.

289
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:22,440
I have offered something else
to Seele's old men.

290
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,671
We needn't worry.

291
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,280
We would like for things to proceed smoothly.

292
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:32,817
We do not wish to subject you to
any more degradation and suffering.

293
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,387
I do not feel humiliated whatsoever.

294
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,489
A strong-willed woman.

295
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,125
I can understand why lkari
would want you by his side.

296
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:45,106
But the person who handed you to us
is none other than lkari.

297
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,767
He refused to hand over the pilot
of Unit 00 for questioning.

298
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:51,668
He sent you as a substitute, Dr. Akagi.

299
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,340
I was sent in place of Rei?

300
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:56,741
Sorry, but don't
bother me.
Working

301
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,956
This is a part of the truth that you wanted.

302
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,049
I devised thirty-six other ways
to send it to you,

303
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,684
but you probably won't get them.

304
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,495
The only definite one is this capsule.

305
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,355
This is everything I have to offer.

306
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:11,666
Do with it as you see fit.

307
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,268
The password is our very first
memory together.

308
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,116
Bye, take care.

309
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:23,252
The phone that won't ring,
I won't let it irritate me anymore.

310
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,254
Because I've accepted your feelings.

311
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:35,413
Are we certain we did the right thing
concerning Dr. Akagi?

312
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,148
She is different from Fuyutsuki.

313
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,384
Returning her is in our best interest.

314
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:41,653
She has rendered distinguishing service
to the Eva series.

315
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,788
She can be of some use to us right now.

316
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,092
Indeed, for the sake of mankind's future.

317
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:50,795
Eight Evangelions are already being prepared.

318
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,431
Which leaves four more.

319
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:58,432
The annihilation of New Tokyo-3 will be good
material upon which to advance our plans.

320
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,205
Hurry their completion.

321
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:02,166
That will be our promised day.

322
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:08,206
Yes, hello?

323
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:10,548
Just listen to me.

324
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,350
I've released the restraints placed on you.

325
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,252
You should be able to go outside now.

326
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,332
Miss Ritsuko?

327
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,767
It's no use, not without my pass.

328
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,605
I see. It's Kaji's handiwork, isn't it?

329
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:36,641
You're going to let me see the secret
in there with my own eyes.

330
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,782
Fine, but he's coming too.

331
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:42,863
Fine.

332
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,202
This looks just like Ayanami's room.

333
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,071
This IS Rei Ayanami's room.

334
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:08,073
This is where she was born and raised.

335
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:09,074
This place?

336
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,855
Yes, this is where she was born.

337
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,412
The water and light that form
Rei's subconscious

338
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,614
must have a strong impression of this place.

339
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,835
Dr. Akagi, this isn't what I came here to see.

340
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:22,403
I know, Misato.

341
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,358
Evas?!

342
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,827
The very first ones.

343
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,128
They are the failures.

344
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:31,678
They were scrapped ten years ago.

345
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,232
A graveyard for Evas...

346
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,201
It's just a garbage dump.

347
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:38,282
This is also where your mother disappeared.

348
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,518
You may not remember it, but I believe
you were also watching

349
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:45,376
the very moment your mother vanished.

350
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:49,107
Ritsuko!

351
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,259
So, this is the source of the dummy plugs?

352
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,672
I will show you the truth.

353
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:09,910
Rei Ayanami?

354
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:14,572
You're not saying the Evas' dummy plugs are...

355
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:17,809
That's right, the part that becomes
the core of the dummy system,

356
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,410
and this is the manufacturing plant for it.

357
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,779
This is?!

358
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,547
These are just dummies.

359
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,768
And nothing more than parts for Rei.

360
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:29,487
Man found God and in their joy,
tried to make Him theirs.

361
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,289
That's why there was divine retribution.

362
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,224
That was fifteen years ago.

363
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,395
The God they found had also
disappeared by then.

364
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:39,125
But then, they tried to resurrect
God on their own.

365
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,499
The result was Adam.

366
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,110
And imitating God, they created
people from Adam.

367
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:46,404
The result was the Evas.

368
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:49,374
People? They're human?

369
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,609
Yes, they're human.

370
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,311
The Evas do not intrinsically have souls,

371
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,151
but they have human souls embedded in them.

372
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:57,457
They were all salvaged.

373
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,899
The only vessel that contained a soul was Rei.

374
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:03,714
She was the only one born with a soul.

375
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:06,337
The Chamber of Gaf was empty, you see.

376
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:10,195
These things here that look like Rei
have no souls.

377
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:11,505
They're just vessels.

378
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,187
That's why I'm going to destroy them.
Because I hate them.

379
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,118
Do you know just what you're doing?!

380
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,351
Yes, I know. I'm destroying them.

381
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,725
They're not people.
They're things shaped like people.

382
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,909
But I lost, even to these things! I couldn't win!

383
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,891
I only needed to think of him,

384
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:42,142
and I could endure any kind of humiliation!

385
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:44,772
I didn't care what happened to my body!

386
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:48,554
But he... He...

387
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,069
And I knew too.

388
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,687
I'm a fooll

389
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,044
Like mother, like daughter,
we're both big fools!

390
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,745
If you want to kill me, do it.

391
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,628
No, I would be happy if you would do it.

392
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:08,168
That would be truly foolish of you.

393
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,713
The tragedy of the people
possessed by the Evas...

394
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,551
But that goes for me too.

395
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,830
To Be Continued

396
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:01,392
Preview

397
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,968
The city that the boy had
been protecting disappears.

398
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,838
The friends that the boy had
been close to leave.

399
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:10,575
The girls that the boy had
been drawn to turn to fear.

400
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:12,643
Shinji has lost all his emotional supports,

401
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:16,080
but a new boy smiles upon him in the dusk.

402
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:19,481
Shinji gives himself over to the smile that seems
to envelop all the sins he has ever committed.

403
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:23,579
But a cruel fate was in store for them.

404
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:26,353
Next time: "The Final Messenger"

405
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:28,796
Next Time
The Final Messenger
