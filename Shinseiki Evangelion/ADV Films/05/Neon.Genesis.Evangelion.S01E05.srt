1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:06,034
Just like the cruel angel

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,870
Young boy, become a legend

3
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:27,923
Even though the untested breeze
taps at the door to your heart

4
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:36,290
You just look solely at me and smile

5
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:42,771
So intent on seeking out that gentle touch

6
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:50,781
Such innocent eyes, still ignorant
of their destiny

7
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:57,789
But someday, you are sure to realize
that upon your back

8
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:05,706
You have the wings with which to fly
towards the distant future

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,902
The cruel angel's thesis

10
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,640
Soon, you will take flight from the windowsill

11
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:18,411
With your torrent of ardent pathos

12
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:22,113
If you are to betray our memories

13
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:25,750
You, who embrace these heavens and shine

14
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:29,032
Young boy, become a legend

15
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:32,287
Nerv Headquarters - Test Facility 2

16
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:33,326

22 Days Ago
Commence activation.

18
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:34,994
Commence activation.

19
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:36,862
Connecting main power to all circuits.

20
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:39,883
Main power supply connected.
Commencing activation system.

21
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:48,737
Activation voltage is approaching
critical level. 0.5, 0.2. Rising.

22
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:51,110
Begin the second phase
of the activation system.

23
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,079
Pilot has begun link-up.

24
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,480
Start system Phase 2.

25
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,018
Synapses inserted. Junctions connecting.

26
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,286
Transmitting pulse.

27
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,887
All circuits are operational.

28
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,955
No problems with initial contact.

29
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,267
Power supplied to brachial muscles
in both arms.

30
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:09,894
All nerve links checking out normal.

31
00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:12,430
Check list satisfactory up to 2550.

32
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:13,632
Prepare for third stage connection.

33
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,935
Clear up to 2580.

34
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,170
Counting down to the absolute borderline.

35
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,505
0.9...

36
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:20,706

0.3...

40
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:25,778
The pulses are flowing backward!

41
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,611
Something's going wrong in the third stage!

42
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,971
Rejection occurring in the
nerve center elements!

43
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,257
Cease contact! Break all circuits
through number six!

44
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,189
I can't! The signal's not being received!

45
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,208
Unit 00 is out of control!

46
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,611
Abort the experiment.
Shut off the power supply.

47
00:02:58,612 --> 00:02:59,482
Yes, Sir!

48
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,623
Unit 00 has switched to backup power!

49
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,293
Thirty-five seconds until it comes
to a complete stop.

50
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:23,798
It's dangerous! Please get back!

51
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,340
Auto ejection activating!

52
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,631
No!

53
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:35,748
Complete shutdown in ten seconds. 9...

54
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,450
Use the special Bakelite! Hurry!
Complete shutdown in ten seconds. 9...

55
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:37,616
Use the special Bakelite! Hurry!

58
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:39,484
Rei!
7.

59
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:39,885
Rei!
6...

60
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:40,585
6...

61
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:41,754

62
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:42,822

63
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:43,923

65
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:45,924
1.

66
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:46,506
Zerol

67
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,983
Rei, are you all right?

68
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,737
Rei!

69
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:13,382
I see.

70
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,938
Episode Five
Rei, Beyond the Heart

71
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:27,032
Rei Ayanami, age fourteen.

72
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:30,669
The first test subject chosen in
accordance with the Marduk Report.

73
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,671
The First Child.

74
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,802
She is the designated pilot for
Evangelion prototype Unit 00.

75
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,946
Her past has been eradicated. All her
personal records were erased.

76
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,150
So, what caused the accident during
the last experiment?

77
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,618
We still don't know.

78
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:50,619
However, we believe that mental instability
on the part of the pilot was a primary cause.

79
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:54,393
Mental instability? In Rei?

80
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:58,497
Yes, her mind became much more disturbed
than we had anticipated.

81
00:04:58,498 --> 00:04:59,632
So what happened?

82
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,623
I don't know.

83
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:04,069
But could it be...

84
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,005
Did something occur to you?

85
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,726
No, that can't be it.

86
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,887
So this is our enemy.

87
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:45,778
I see. Most everything except the core
remains intact.

88
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,347
This is an ideal sample.

89
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,415
I appreciate it!

90
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,496
So, did you find anything new?

91
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,255
What the heck is this?

92
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:59,058
That's the code number for
"cannot be analyzed".

93
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:01,327
You mean, you don't know
what the heck it is?

94
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:05,231
Correct. We do know the Angel is
composed of a type of matter

95
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:07,632
characterized by both particulate and
wave properties, like light.

96
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,806
But you've at least found its power source,
haven't you?

97
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,608
Something like that anyway.

98
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:18,677
But we haven't been able to figure out
any of its operating principles.

99
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:21,914
Well, I guess there's still a whole world
of things we don't know about yet.

100
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:24,416
The world is filled with mysteries.

101
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,352
For example, take a look at this.

102
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:28,523
This is the Angel's inherent wave pattern.

103
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:31,616
What? Let me see.

104
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:35,794
Could this be...

105
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,898
Yes. Although they are composed
of a different form of matter,

106
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,967
their actual composition,
in terms of the arrangement

107
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,905
and spacing of the pattern, falls within
a 99.89% match of human genes.

108
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,807
99.89%7?

109
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,976
It really shows us just how limited
our level of understanding is.

110
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,978
Bring it down... slowly...
It really shows us just how limited
our level of understanding is.

111
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:53,312
Okay!
It really shows us just how limited
our level of understanding is.

112
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:53,779
Okay!

113
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,115
That's good. Stop.

114
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:57,683
This is the core?

115
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:58,851
How's the rest of it?

116
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:02,855
It's pretty deteriorated. We can't expect
to use it as a reference.

117
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,723
That's not a problem.
Dispose of the remnants.

118
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,492
Yes, Sir.

119
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:07,826
What's wrong?

120
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,197
Well, nothing's wrong.

121
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:16,068
Are you aware that when you say
"nothing" that way,

122
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:19,989
it's the same as asking others
to pay attention to you?

123
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:28,647
Well, it's just that my father seems
to have burned his hands.

124
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:29,938
Burned?

125
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,452
I was just wondering how it happened.

126
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,755
Burns? Do you know?

127
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,924
It was before you arrived at Nerv.

128
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:42,361
Unit 00 went berserk during
the activation experiments.

129
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:43,696
You've heard about that, right?

130
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,097
Yes.

131
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:49,034
The pilot was trapped inside.

132
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,971
The pilot? You mean Ayanami, right?

133
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,740
It was Commander lkari who rescued her.

134
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:58,577
He opened the super-heated hatch
with his bare hands.

135
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,948
My father did that?

136
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,784
That's how he burned his hands.

137
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:08,854
Go, Hideko!

138
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,522
Come on, lose!

139
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:13,559
You've got to treat us to pizza if you lose!

140
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,994
There, go for it!

141
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:15,925
You won't make it!

142
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:19,875
Now, let's sink a shot!

143
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,402
Oh my gosh! Those guys are looking at us!

144
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:26,005
Perverts!
Oh my gosh! Those guys are looking at us!

145
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,465
Man, they've all got such incredible breasts.

146
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,878
Suzuhara's ogling us! Gross!

147
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,579
Hi, Shiniji!
Suzuhara's ogling us! Gross!

148
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,540
Hi, Shiniji!

149
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:37,649
Hey, Chief!

150
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,818
What're you lookin' at so intently?

151
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:40,919
Nothing!

152
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,921
Was it Ayanami? Am I right?

153
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,590
No!

154
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:48,527
Oh, come on. That's suspicious...

155
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,229
Ayanami's boobs...

156
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,064
Ayanami's thighs...

157
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:53,232
Ayanami's...

158
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,501
...calves!

159
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,336
1 told you, it's nothing like that.

160
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:59,071
Then, what were you looking at?

161
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,532
You can't fool me.

162
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:06,766
I was just wondering why she's always alone.

163
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,216
Come to think of it,

164
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,653
she hasn't had any friends since
she started here in the seventh grade.

165
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,823
There's just something about her that
makes her hard to approach.

166
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:20,133
She's probably just got a lousy personality.

167
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,600
You're both Eva pilots, right?
You should know her better than us.

168
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,269
He's right.

169
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,400
Well, I've hardly spoken to her.

170
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,976
Eva Unit 01 is now entering
the third stage cooling process.

171
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:42,381
Lower all systems to Phase 3 in Cage 6.

172
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:45,584
The earlier harmonics and
synchronization tests were good.

173
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,186
All numerical conditions
have been satisfied.

174
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,988
Roger. Transmit the results to Balthazar.

175
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,290
Roger.

176
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:55,828
Transmit the full range of the entry plug's
personal data to Melchior.

177
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,396
Data transmitting.

178
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:59,297
This is Melchior, roger. Circuits connected.

179
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,639
Initiating third stage cooling process.

180
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,536
CBL circulation has begun.

181
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,805
Condensation reactor,
commencing operation.

182
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,141
Vent waste fluid to the second
purification system.

183
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:12,544
The protein walls are in good condition.
No problems detected.

184
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,505
T minus 1,050 minutes until the Unit 00
re-activation experiment.

185
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,853
What is this?!

186
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:22,321
It's curry.

187
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,923
So you're still eating this instant stuff.

188
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,144
Look, you're a guest, so you've got
no right to complain.

189
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,663
What about you, Miss Misato?

190
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:31,763
For me...

191
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:32,831
Super Cup
Green Onion Roast Pork
For me...

192
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:33,792
Super Cup
Green Onion Roast Pork

193
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:39,004
Ta-da! Just pour it right in here!

194
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,572
Are you serious?

195
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,375
Oh, don't you know how good this is?

196
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,243
Okay...

197
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:48,114
Ordinary curry flavored instant ramen
can't compare to this!

198
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,084
Let's eat!

199
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,715
The trick is to put less hot water in the soup.

200
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:03,562
Misato cooked this, didn't she?

201
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:04,129
Yes.
Misato cooked this, didn't she?

202
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,464
Yes.
Oh, can you tell?

203
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:06,298
Oh, can you tell?

204
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,432
Yes, by its taste.

205
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:10,235
How can she make something
ready-to-eat taste so awful?

206
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:14,045
Next time, invite me when
it's Shinji's turn to cook.

207
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,862
Shinji, you really ought to move out.

208
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:40,263
You shouldn't let one bad roommate
ruin your life.

209
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,431
I'm used to it now.

210
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,870
He's right, Ritsuko.

211
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,672
Never underestimate the ability
of the human animal

212
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,974
to adapt to its environment.

213
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,443
And anyway, if he does move...

214
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,845
Shinji, can you bring me
another one, please?

215
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:54,880
Right.

216
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,682
The red tape would be a pain.

217
00:11:56,683 --> 00:12:00,018
He just got his permanent security card,
you know.

218
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,187
Oh, I almost forgot!

219
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,323
Shinji, would you do me a favor?

220
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:05,724
What is it?

221
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,245
Rei Ayanami's renewal card.

222
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,729
I keep forgetting to give this to her.

223
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,730
Would you mind delivering it
before you go to headquarters?

224
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,192
Sure.

225
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:26,878
What's the matter?
You're staring at Rei's picture.

226
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,614
Nothing!

227
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,649
Shinji, don't tell me...

228
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,883
No!

229
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:35,420
Oh, come on! You're blushing!

230
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,656
Well, you've got an official excuse
to go to Rei's place now.

231
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,327
This is your chance, isn't it?

232
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,142
Stop teasing me!

233
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:46,765
But I love teasing you.
You always take it so seriously!

234
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,900
Just like Misato.

235
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:52,104
I just find it strange that I know
so little about Ayanami,

236
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,306
even though we're both Eva pilots.

237
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:57,709
She's a very nice girl,
but she's like your father.

238
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,945
She's not very adept.

239
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,756
Not adept at what?

240
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:04,493
Living.

241
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,942
Ayanami

242
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,084
Excuse me?

243
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,496
Excuse me, it's Ikari.

244
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,204
I'm coming in, Ayanami!

245
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,526
Are these hers?

246
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,449
Well...

247
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,200
I didn't mean...

248
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,222
Do you mind moving?

249
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,623
l...

250
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,521
What is it?

251
00:15:56,522 --> 00:16:00,212
Well, I mean, I was...

252
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:09,367
I was asked to, so...

253
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,603
What was it? The card, your card...

254
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,705
It's been renewed!

255
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,226
I was asked to deliver it.

256
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,480
So... So, I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

257
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:31,058
Miss Ritsuko said she forgot to give it to you.

258
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:36,194
It's true. I rang your bell,
but there was no reply,

259
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,655
and the door was unlocked. So...

260
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:02,454
Central Dogma is currently
open to the public.

261
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:04,565
Group 3 should proceed directly
to the fourth gate.

262
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:08,023
Good morning

263
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:11,687
This is your new card. Miss Ritsuko
asked me to deliver it to you.

264
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,873
I'm sorry about earlier.

265
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,164
About what?

266
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,916
You have a re-activation experiment
today, don't you?

267
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,920
Wouldn't it be great if it were
successful this time?

268
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:42,957
Say, aren't you afraid of getting in
Unit 00 again?

269
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,087
Why?

270
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:52,404
I heard that you were hurt pretty badly
in an earlier experiment,

271
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,245
so I was wondering if you were okay about it.

272
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,912
Aren't you Commander lkari's son?

273
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:01,880
Yeah.

274
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:05,517
Don't you have faith in your
own father's work?

275
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:07,948
Of course not! How could I trust him?

276
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,313
What?

277
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,614
Rei, are you all right?

278
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,905
Rei...

279
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:42,854
The pilot was trapped inside.

280
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,790
It was Commander lkari who rescued her.

281
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,160
He opened the super-heated hatch
with his bare hands.

282
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,031
That's how he burned his hands.

283
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,706
Rei.

284
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,074
Can you hear me?

285
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,476
Yes.

286
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:08,179
We will now commence the Unit 00
re-activation experiment.

287
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,550
First stage connection initiated.

288
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,318
Connecting main power supply.

289
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,654
Activation voltage has passed
the critical point.

290
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,921
Roger.

291
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,324
Shift format to Phase 2.

292
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,459
Connecting pilot to Unit 00.

293
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,860
Opening circuits.

294
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,148
Pulse and harmonics are normal.

295
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,168
No problems detected in synchronization.

296
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,369
All nerve links completed.

297
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,173
Central nervous system
elements are nominal.

298
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,634
Re-calculating, no error corrections.

299
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,787
Checklist is satisfactory up to 2590.

300
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,148
Approaching the absolute borderline.

301
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:44,616
2.5 more.

302
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:45,817
1.7...

303
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:46,918
1.2..

304
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,186
1.0...

305
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,454
0.8...

306
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:50,655
0.6...

307
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:51,823
0.5...

308
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:53,058
0.4...

309
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,259
0.3...

310
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,460
0.2...

311
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:58,029
0.1, and rising.

312
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,131
Borderline cleared.

313
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,367
Unit 00 has been activated.

314
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,535
Roger.

315
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,904
Beginning interlock test.

316
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:06,695
Roger.

317
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:15,780
Ikari, an unidentified flying object
is approaching.

318
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,215
It is likely the fifth Angel.

319
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:21,553
Stop the test. All personnel,
alert status Level One.

320
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,189
You're not going to use Unit 00?

321
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,325
She's not ready to fight yet.
What's the status on Unit 01?

322
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,627
1t'll be ready in 380 seconds.

323
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:30,628
Engagel!

324
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:31,329
Yes, Sir.

325
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,130
Rei.
Yes, Sir.

326
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:32,597
Rei.

327
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,908
Re-activation was successful.
Return now.

328
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,093
The target is passing over Tonosawa.

329
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,054
Unit 01 is beginning launch preparations.

330
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,135
Releasing primary lock bolts.

331
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,401
Release confirmed.

332
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,236
Roger.
Release confirmed.

333
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:11,903
Roger.
Releasing secondary restraints.

334
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:12,904
Releasing secondary restraints.

335
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:13,905
Roger.

336
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:16,574
The target is now intruding into
Lake Ashino airspace.

337
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:19,477
Eva Unit 01 is ready for launch.

338
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:20,768
Launch!

339
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,754
We're detecting a high energy reaction
from inside the target!

340
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:30,789
What?!

341
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,124
The circumference area is accelerating!
It's converging!

342
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,415
It can't bel

343
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:41,906
No, dodge it!

344
00:21:58,784 --> 00:21:59,651
Shinji!

345
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:00,702
To Be Continued

346
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,145
Preview

347
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:12,290
Shinji is saved, but his injuries
cause him to act spoiled.

348
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:13,625
Rei pushes him away.

349
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:17,195
Meanwhile, Misato tries to mount
a pin-point attack on the Angel.
