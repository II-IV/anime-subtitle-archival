1
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:06,568
Just like the cruel angel

2
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:14,404
Young boy, become a legend

3
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:28,457
Even though the untested breeze
taps at the door to your heart

4
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:36,813
You just look solely at me and smile

5
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:43,305
So intent on seeking out that gentle touch

6
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:51,295
Such innocent eyes, still ignorant
of their destiny

7
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:58,323
But someday, you are sure to realize
that upon your back

8
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:06,240
You have the wings with which to fly
towards the distant future

9
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:11,437
The cruel angel's thesis

10
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,173
Soon, you will take flight from the windowsill

11
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:18,945
With your torrent of ardent pathos

12
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:22,648
If you are to betray our memories

13
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:26,285
You, who embrace these heavens and shine

14
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:29,566
Young boy, become a legend

15
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,295
Lucky!

16
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:39,532
I'm so lucky that I can go shopping
with you today, Mr. Kaji!

17
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:40,699
What?! Isn't this the swimsuit section?

18
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,935
Please allow us to announce
a call for a customer.
What?! Isn't this the swimsuit section?

Please allow us to announce
a call for a customer.
Hey! Hey! How do you like this?

20
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,137
Mr. Yamazaki from Ibaragi City,
your friend is waiting for you.
Hey! Hey! How do you like this?

21
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:49,308
Mr. Yamazaki from Ibaragi City,
your friend is waiting for you.
Slow down, school girl.
Aren't you a little young for that?

22
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,676
Please come to Customer Service
on the first floor.
You're just so behind the times, Mr. Kaji.

23
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,378
Please come to Customer Service
on the first floor.
This is pretty normal nowadays.

24
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:53,789
This is pretty normal nowadays.

25
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,149
Really? I had no idea.

26
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,152
But this is the big school trip.
You've got to go all out!

Okinawa!

32
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,945
We're even scheduled to go scuba diving!

Scuba diving...

36
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:13,499
Come to think of it, it's been
three years since I've gone diving.

37
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,902
Say, where did you go for your school trip?

38
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:19,153
Oh, we didn't have one.

39
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,741
Why not?

40
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:23,643
Because of the Second Impact.

42
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,235
I can't go on the trip?!

43
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:35,921
Right.

44
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:36,822
Why not?!
Right.

45
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:37,055
Why not?!

46
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:38,357
Because you're on standby for combat duty.

47
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,091
You never told me anything about that!

48
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,192
I just told you.

49
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:42,695
Who in the hell decided that?!

50
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:45,006
Me, the Operations Planning Manager.

51
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:54,073
Hey, why don't you stop slurping that tea
and say something!

52
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:55,474
You're a man, aren't you?

53
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:59,278
Actually, 1 kind of anticipated
it would be like this.

54
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,269
And you've already given up?

55
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,719
How pathetic. Nothing's more useless
than a housebroken male.

56
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,680
Please don't talk about me like that.

57
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,624
I know how you must feel,

58
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,591
but there's just no helping this.

59
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:17,783
There's always the possibility of
an Angel attack while you're gone.

60
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:19,097
Sohryu

61
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:22,601
Sohryu
It's always standby!
Standby, standby, standby!

62
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:26,138
Sohryu
We've always got to be ready to defend
against an enemy who may not even come!

63
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,307
Sohryu
Why don't you try to find out where they are,
and attack them for once?!

64
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,418
Why don't you try to find out where they are,
and attack them for once?!

65
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,678
If we could do that,
we'd have already done it.

66
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:36,248
Look, think of this as a good opportunity.

67
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,884
While the rest of your class is on the trip,

68
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,287
the two of you can study a little.

69
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:43,428
Or do you think I don't know about these?

70
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,859
You're greatly mistaken if you thought
I wouldn't find out about these.

71
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:52,780
What you get on your tests at school
is piped directly to me.

72
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,503
It's ridiculous. Who cares about grades?

73
00:03:57,504 --> 00:04:01,107
I've got absolutely no interest in
the old-fashioned grading system.

74
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,609
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

75
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,011
Try to adjust to Japanese school life.

76
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,262
No way!

77
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,631
Asuka, I'll bring you some souvenirs!

78
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:17,423
Well, it's just too bad for you guys!

79
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,763
I'll have enough fun for both of ya!

80
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,367
Paste the observation data on Mt. Asama

81
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:31,238
from Balthasar to Melchior
as soon as possible.

82
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,846
A school trip?

83
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,249
That's pretty carefree for times like these.

84
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,884
Well, it's because the times are so hard

85
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:47,605
that they want to have a little fun
while they can.

86
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,669
What are you up to?

87
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,899
Studying science.

88
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,468
You're such a diligent student.

89
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,079
You can say that, but I have to do it anyway.

90
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,807
Ta da!

91
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:11,310
Since I can't go scuba diving in Okinawa,
I'm going to do it here!

92
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,745
Really?

93
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,947
Let's see. What're you working on?

94
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,027
Let me take a look.

95
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,604
You can't solve an easy equation like this?

96
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,454
There, done.

97
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,323
It's so easy.

98
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,559
How can you solve a difficult
problem like this,

99
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,230
and not make good grades on your tests?

100
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:32,464
Because I couldn't figure out
what the questions said.

101
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,634
You mean you couldn't read
the questions in Japanese?

102
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:38,737
Right, I haven't learned all
the Chinese characters yet.

103
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,106
We didn't study it in college over there.

104
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:41,974
College?

105
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:44,476
Oh, I graduated last year.

106
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:47,479
So, what does this one say?

107
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,015
It's about thermal expansion.

108
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,086
Thermal expansion? That's kid stuff!

109
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:54,987
To put it simply,

110
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:59,848
things expand when they get hot,
and shrink when they get cold.

111
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,962
Well, yeah, but...

112
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:07,399
If I were to warm up just my breasts,
do you think they'd grow a little bigger?

113
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,369
I wouldn't know anything about that!

114
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,010
What a boring guy.

115
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,476
Watch this, Shinji!

116
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,241
Back roll entry!

117
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,846
This just isn't clear enough.

118
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,815
But just as the report from Mt. Asama
Earthquake Research Laboratory says,

119
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,550
this shadow is definitely suspicious.

120
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,619
Of course, we can't ignore this.

121
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,910
What is the Magi's judgment?

122
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,189
Fifty-fifty.

123
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,291
Is someone there yet?

124
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,691
Captain Katsuragi's already on site.

125
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,566
You're too deep!

126
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,677
Not yet. Another 500, please.

127
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,639
Depth 1200. The pressure resistant
partition is cracking.

128
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,880
Ms. Katsuragi!

129
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:30,460
If it breaks, we'll pay for the damage.
200 more.

130
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,550
We're monitoring a reaction!

131
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:38,958
Begin analysis!

132
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,419
Yes, Ma'am!

133
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,881
The probe has imploded due
to the extreme pressure.

134
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:52,671
What about the analysis?

135
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:56,108
Just barely made it. The pattern is blue.

136
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:59,311
There's no doubt, it's an Angel.

137
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,914
As of now, this laboratory will be
completely sealed off!

138
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,049
It's under Nerv's jurisdiction now!

139
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,218
Any and all access to the outside
world is prohibited,

140
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,379
and all records of the events of the
past six hours are classified.

Request an A-17 from Commander lkari,

143
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:15,448
Request an A-17 from Commander lkari,
top priority!

144
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:19,131
Watch what you're saying.
This is an open line.

145
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:23,235
I know. Hurry up and switch
to a scrambled line.

146
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,970
A-177?1

147
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,572
We're going to launch an offensive?

148
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:27,940
Correct.

149
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,975
Unacceptable, it's too dangerous.

150
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,611
You had better not say you've forgotten
what happened fifteen years ago.

151
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:36,949
This is a chance to move from
a consistently defensive posture

152
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,151
to an offensive one for the first time.

153
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,387
The risk is too large.

154
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:46,388
However, I'm sure you're aware how
important a live Angel sample would be.

155
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,253
We will not tolerate failure.

156
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,931
Failure?

157
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,622
If we fail, it will result in the extinction
of the human race.

158
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,912
You're really sure about this?

159
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:01,874
This is an Angel?

160
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:06,412
Yes, it's something like a chrysalis
prior to reaching the adult stage.

161
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:09,982
This operation's prime objective
is to capture this Angel.

162
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:13,519
We must capture it alive, as close
to its original state as possible.

163
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,787
And if we can't?

164
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:16,989
Then you must destroy it immediately.
Do you understand?

165
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,723
Yes, Ma'am!

166
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:18,724
The designated pilot for
the actual operation is...
Yes, Ma'am!

167
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:19,258
The designated pilot for
the actual operation is...

168
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,429
Hey, let me! I'll dive!

169
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,496
But I'll bet it's going to be me again.

170
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,432
Asuka.

171
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,067
Carry out the mission using Unit 02.

172
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,370
Sure! This'll be a piece of cake.

173
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,571
And me?

174
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,875
The prototype Unit 00 isn't compatible with
the special equipment we'll be using.

175
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,812
Rei and Unit 00 will remain at
headquarters on standby.

176
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:40,712
Yes, Ma'am.

177
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,448
Oh, too bad for you.

178
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:43,968
You don't get to go to the hot springs.

179
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,687
Since an A-17 has been ordered,
we'll scramble immediately.

180
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:49,688
Get ready.

181
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,118
Yes, Ma'am!

182
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:57,416
You say this is the heat resistant plug suit,
but it's not any different.

183
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,081
Try pressing the switch on the right.

184
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,997
Oh, nol

185
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,537
What is this?!

186
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:08,045
Unit 02 is also ready.

187
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,385
No! What is that?!

188
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,448
The suit is designed to protect you from
heat, pressure, and radiation.

189
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,529
This is Type-D equipment, for combat
under extreme environmental duress.

190
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,642
Is that my Unit 02?

191
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,557
No way! Count me out!

192
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:28,127
I don't want to appear in public in this!

193
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,629
This sort of thing is up Shinji's alley!

194
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,120
That's too bad.

195
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,467
I was anticipating seeing Asuka's
gallant figure!

196
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,928
No!

197
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:42,708
But I don't have the courage to go
in front of Mr. Kaji looking so uncool!

198
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:43,876
This is a problem.

199
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,396
Yes...

200
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,013
Excuse me, but I...

201
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,594
Il go in Unit 02.

202
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:55,365
Sorry, but I don't want you
touching my Unit 02!

203
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,663
I'd rather do it than let
the First take my place.

204
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,808
I know it's uncool, but put up with it, okay?

205
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,526
Eva Units 01 and 02 have arrived.

206
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,748
Have both units stand by in position.

207
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,551
Move in the laser bore, and ready the crane.

208
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:26,218
Roger.

209
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:27,553
Boom arm fixed in place.

210
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:29,424
Coolant circulation system going on auto.

211
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:32,324
Hey, where's Mr. Kaji?

212
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,755
That jerk won't be here.
There's nothing for him to do.

213
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,767
Damn! I wanted him to see how great I am.

214
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,833
So, an A-17 has been ordered.

215
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,736
That includes the freeze of all current assets.

216
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:47,906
I'm sure there are many people who
will be put out by that.

217
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,675
Why didn't you stop them?

218
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:53,612
I didn't have any excuse.
The order was official.

219
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:57,449
But if Nerv fails, it'll mean
the end of the world.

220
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,640
They're not that arrogant.

221
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,890
What are those?

222
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,593
The UN's Air Force is on standby alert.

223
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:09,595
Until this mission has been completed.

224
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,196
Are they going to help us?

225
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,265
No, they're here to clean up.

226
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,756
In case we fail.

227
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,202
What do you mean?

228
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:20,512
They will use N2 depth charges to
destroy the Angel, and us with it.

229
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:22,774
That's awfull

230
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:25,310
Who would order something like that?

231
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,601
Commander Ikari.

232
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,953
Laser operation, complete.

233
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,154
The bore path has been secured.

234
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,885
The Type D equipment
is functioning normally.

235
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,388
Unit 02 is in position to dispatch.

236
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,427
Roger.

237
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,263
Asuka, are you ready?

238
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,831
Anytime you are.

239
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:47,122
Launch!

240
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,919
Looks hot!

241
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,317
Unit 02 is entering the lava.

242
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,490
Watch this, Shinji!

243
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,692
Giant stroke entry!

244
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,463
Current depth, 170. Speed of descent, 20.

245
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,931
No problems detected.

246
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:23,235
Visibility is zero. I can't see a thing.

247
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:24,906
Switching to CT monitor.

248
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,960
Even with this, visibility is no more than 120.

249
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,270
Depth, 400...

250
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,582
450...

251
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,950
500...

252
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,686
5650...

253
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:41,887
600...

254
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:42,878
650...

255
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,495
900...

256
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,331
950...

257
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,498
1000...

258
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,800
1020...

259
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,351
We're over the maximum safe depth.

260
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,039
Depth is 1300. Estimated target level.

261
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,620
Asuka, can you see anything?

262
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:05,777
No reactions detected. It's not here.

263
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,280
It seems the lava current
is faster than we thought.

264
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:11,149
The target's velocity doesn't
match our predictions.

265
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,751
Hurry up and re-calculate.

266
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:15,181
Continue the operation. Resume descent.

267
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,295
Depth, 1350...

268
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:24,586
1400...

269
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:28,066
A crack has occurred in
the second coolant pipe.

270
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,402
Depth, 1480...

271
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,537
We're over the maximum allowed depth.

272
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,273
We haven't made contact with the target yet.

273
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,508
Keep going.

274
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,542
How's it going, Asuka?

275
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:41,146
Looks like we're still good. I just want to
hurry up, finish this, and take a shower.

276
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:44,082
There's a nice hot spring near here.
We'll hit it once we're done.

277
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,313
Hang in there a little longer.

278
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,830
Maximum allowed depth plus 120.

279
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,994
Eva Unit 02 has lost its prog knife.

280
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,163
Maximum allowed depth plus 200.

281
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:00,499
Miss Katsuragi, any more than this and...

282
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,001
There's a human on board this time!

283
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,670
I am in charge of this operation.

284
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:06,961
Proceed, please.

285
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,960
Misato's right. I'm okay. I can keep going.

286
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:19,184
Depth, 1780...

287
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:20,885
We've reached the adjusted target depth.

288
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:26,180
There it is!

289
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,396
Visual confirmation of the target.

290
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,687
Prepare to capture.

291
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,302
Both of you are being moved
by convection currents,

292
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,038
so you'll only have one chance
to make contact.

293
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,174
I know. Leave it to me.

294
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,443
T-minus 30 to contact.

295
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,993
Relative velocity 2.2. I'm now on the axis.

296
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,256
Electromagnetic cage deployed.
No problems detected.

297
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,364
The target has been captured.

298
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,647
Nice one, Asuka.

299
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,996
Capture operation completed.

300
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,257
I'm coming up now.

301
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:13,405
Are you all right, Asuka?

302
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:17,075
Of course! Fear is often worse
than the danger, as they say.

303
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,386
It really was a piece of cake.

304
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:22,641
But this is more of a sauna suit
than a plug suit.

305
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,262
I can't wait to get to the hot spring.

306
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,088
Looks like the tension let loose all at once.

307
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:30,956
You think?

308
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:34,259
You were scared about this operation too,
weren't you?

309
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,196
Well, yeah, because if we handled it badly,
we'd have had a repeat performance.

310
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,247
That's true, the Second Impact.

311
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,297
We don't need another of those.

312
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,810
What's going on?!

313
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:53,078
Not good! It's started to emerge!

314
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:54,368
It's much earlier than we predicted!

315
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:55,814
Status of the cage?!

316
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:56,147
No way it can hold!
Status of the cage?!

317
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:56,998
No way it can hold!

318
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,700
Abort the capture! Jettison the cage!

319
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:07,526
We're changing the operation!

320
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,694
Destroying the Angel is now top priority!

321
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:12,797
Unit 02, prepare for combat as you withdraw!

322
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,088
What I've been waiting for!

323
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,827
Damn, I forgot I dropped the knife!

324
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,464
It's right in front!

325
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,633
Releasing ballast!

326
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,437
It's fast!

327
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,421
This is bad. I've lost sight of it.

328
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:39,357
In addition to that, I've got lousy visibility,
I'm really hot,

329
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,660
and this suit's plastered to me
and feels disgusting.

330
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,261
This really sucks.

331
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,863
Asuka!

332
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:48,466
We'll take this chance to drop you
Unit 01's knife. Catch it!

333
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:49,757
Roger!

334
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,603
Oh, no! Have you dropped it yet, Shinji?

335
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,578
Contact with knife, 40 seconds.

336
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,313
The Angel is approaching rapidly!

337
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:04,015
No! Go away!

338
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,585
Hurry up with it!

339
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,136
Come on, it's too slow!

340
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,254
Oh, nol

341
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:26,137
Unbelievable! How could it open its mouth
in such an environment?

342
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,568
Its construction must be incredible!

343
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,279
Left leg damaged!

344
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,570
Engage heat shields!

345
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,869
Damn you!

346
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:47,525
If it can withstand such a high heat,
high pressure environment,

347
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:48,960
then the prog knife will be useless against it!

348
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,395
Then what should we do?

349
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:51,296
I know!

350
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:51,563
Just like earlier!
I know!

351
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:52,464
Just like earlier!

352
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,063
Eat this!

353
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,337
I see! Thermal expansion!

354
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,408
Transfer all coolant pressure
to cable three! Hurry!

355
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,310
Right when I succeeded...

356
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,045
Oh, man, is this it?

357
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,143
Shinji?

358
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:55,012
Idiot, don't go overboard.

359
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:02,367
Oomiya

360
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,702
Oomiya
Hello?

361
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:04,269
Welcome Nerv Party
Hello?

362
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,005
Welcome Nerv Party
Is there anyone from Nerv here?

363
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,506
Welcome Nerv Party
Yes!

364
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:08,606
Welcome Nerv Party

365
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:09,808
Cool
Cool

366
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:12,310
Cool
Cool
I need your signature here.

367
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,545
Cool
Cool

368
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,880
Cool
Cool
Thanks so much.

369
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,051
Cool
Cool
From Mr. Kaji?

370
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,072
What could it be?

371
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,905
The bath is over there, to the left.

372
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,458
Bath
Men's Today

373
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:31,936
Heavenly!

374
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:39,258
I never knew a bath could feel this good.

375
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,907
Shinji, can you hear me?

376
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,476
Yes, Ma'am!

377
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,578
Would you throw me the body shampoo?

378
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,539
We ran out of ours.

379
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:52,317
Here it comes.

380
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:53,608
Roger.

381
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,222
Ouch!

382
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:59,858
You idiot! Watch where you're throwing!
You suck!

383
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,459
Sorry.

384
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,028
Don't hit me in some weird spot.

385
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,319
Let me take a look.

386
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:10,772
Wow, your skin is so soft and smooth, Asuka!

387
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,571
Don't! You're tickling me!

388
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:14,861
How about right here?

389
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,675
Don't touch that!

390
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,426
Come on, it doesn't wear out!

391
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,817
It expanded.

392
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:27,018
How embarrassing!

393
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,902
Oh, this? I got this in the Second Impact.

394
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,120
You know all about my past, don't you?

395
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:49,937
Well, yeah. It's part of my job.

396
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:54,045
It's all ancient history for both of us.

397
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,386
We shouldn't let it bother us.

398
00:21:58,217 --> 00:22:00,797
To Be Continued

399
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:07,442
Preview

400
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:12,474
Those who don't think well of Nerv cut off
the power supply to all of New Tokyo-3.

401
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:16,075
With none of the modern facilities
operational, an Angel closes in.
