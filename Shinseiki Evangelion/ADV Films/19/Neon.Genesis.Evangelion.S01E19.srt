15
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,432
Unit 01's interlocking circuits have been cut.

16
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:40,933
What about the force eject signal?

17
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,594
It's being blocked from the plug side.
It's not being accepted.

18
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:47,907
But, Shinji, if we hadn't done that,
you would have been killed.

19
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,408
That doesn't matter.

20
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,277
But it is a fact.

21
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,213
Don't make me more angry
by saying things like that.

22
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:57,015
Unit 01 has 185 seconds of power
left in its reserves.

23
00:01:57,017 --> 00:02:00,086
That's enough to destroy at least
half of Headquarters.

24
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:02,121
The way he is right now, he'll do it too.

25
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,155
Shiniji, listen to us!

26
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,024
If Commander Ikari hadn't made that decision,

27
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,994
everyone could have been killed!

28
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:10,429
I said that doesn't matter!

29
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,597
My father...

30
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,638
That bastard tried to kill Toji!

31
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,394
With my hands...

00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:18,134
Episode Nineteen
A Man'â€™s Battle

33
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:23,042
Father, you're there, aren't you?
Say something! Answer me!

34
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:25,323
Increase the pressure of the LCL to maximum.

35
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,536
We have no time to waste on a childish tantrum.

36
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,503
I've still got a direct control circuit...

37
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:36,288
Damn! Damn!

38
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:39,148
Damn...

39
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,862
The right breast has been completely dissolved.

40
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:45,473
We'll begin cleansing the bodily fluids
from Unit 03 on schedule.

41
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:48,868
Have you recovered?

42
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:51,537
As long as I can work, it's not a problem.

43
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,878
I couldn't just lie in bed during
an emergency like this.

44
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,244
So what happened to Shinji?

45
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:01,047
I understand that they opened the
escape hatch with a laser cutter,

46
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:02,948
and removed him forcibly.

47
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,784
That's just wonderful.

48
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:05,551
This time...

49
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:06,892
It might really be over.

50
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:10,071
I'll bet that idiot won't recover from this.

51
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:12,658
How is lkari?

52
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,861
He wasn't injured, so he ought to be okay.

53
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,642
He's probably dreaming away.

54
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:19,298
Dreaming?

55
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,066
Yeah. Don't tell me you don't dream?
Dreaming?

56
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,027
Yeah. Don't tell me you don't dream?

57
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:35,043
Shinji...

58
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,896
Why's he lyin' here next to me?

59
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:41,533
Where am I?

60
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:43,922
In the same hospital as my sister?

61
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,775
Hey, isn't that Shinji and Ayanami?

62
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:06,679
Ikari, why did you do that?

63
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,520
Because  couldn't forgive my father.

64
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,123
He betrayed me.

65
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,879
I was finally able to have a comfortable
conversation with my father,

66
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:19,026
but he won't try to understand my feelings at all!

67
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,253
Did you try to understand your father's feelings?

68
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,663
I tried.

69
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,365
Why don't you try to understand him?

70
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,000
I said I tried!

71
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,836
And that's how you run away
from unpleasantness.

72
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,338
What's wrong with that?!

73
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,999
What's wrong with running away
from unpleasantness?!

74
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:40,094
What are those two arguin' about?

75
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,518
We're making a special exception for you.
Just for five minutes.

76
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,039
I understand. Thank you very much.

77
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,395
If it isn't the Class Rep...

78
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,096
Suzuhara, are you okay?

79
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,079
Well, looks like I'm still alive.

80
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:10,509
What the heck? I thought Shinji was here.
Was I just dreamin'?

81
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,512
I heard lkari was discharged yesterday.

82
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,412
You've slept for three days, Suzuhara.

83
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,033
I did? For three whole days?

84
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,621
Class Rep, did you...

85
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,858
I came here as part of my duties
as the class representative!

86
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,498
There isn't anything else to it!

87
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:31,297
Yeah, I know that.

88
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:32,588
You don't know anything.

89
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,179
Sorry that I didn't get to eat
the lunch you made.

90
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:39,995
Don't worry about it.

91
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:44,557
But I'm sorry. They won't let me
bring you lunch here.

92
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,514
Class Rep?

93
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,481
What?

94
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,382
Would you do me a favor?

95
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:56,393
Would you tell my sister that there's
nothin' wrong with me?

96
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:03,453
Get out, Shinji lkari.
The Commander wants to see you.

97
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:09,168
Disobeying orders, private
appropriation of an Eva,

98
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,003
blatant intimidation...

99
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,814
These are all criminal offenses.

100
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,624
Do you have anything to say?

101
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,746
Yes, I don't want to pilot an Eva anymore.

102
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,781
I don't want to stay here either.

103
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,383
Then leave.

104
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,314
Yes. I'll go back to my teacher's place.

105
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,053
So you're running away again?

106
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:35,895
You disappoint me.
I doubt we'll ever meet again.

107
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,646
Yes, that's my intent.

108
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:48,674
It's me.

109
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,843
Erase the Third Child.

110
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:54,213
Rei will be Unit 01's designated pilot,

111
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:55,854
with the dummy plug as backup.

112
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,182
Are you there, Shinji?

113
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,883
Is it true that you're leaving?

114
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,987
It's true, isn't it?

115
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,618
But why? Why are you running away now?

116
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,843
 wanted to be like you.

117
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:45,382
I envied you. You're different from us.

118
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:50,526
Damn! Even Toji became an Eva pilot, while ...

119
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,107
This line is monitored.

120
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:58,077
For security reasons, we have
terminated this call.

121
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,568
We appreciate your cooperation.

122
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,518
I'm sure that Asuka is so disgusted with me,
she's not coming.

123
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,949
Yes, she didn't even ask me
to say goodbye to you.

124
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,391
That sounds like her. I'm relieved.

125
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:15,995
If you keep cutting your ties like this,
you'll have a tough life ahead of you.

126
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:19,066
That's your philosophy, Miss Misato.
I can't live like you.

127
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,667
As I'm sure you know,

128
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,768
there will be quite a few restrictions
placed on your activities.

129
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,199
Yes.

130
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:28,907
But...

131
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:29,942
What?

132
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:31,433
Please tell me one thing.

133
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,392
Why was Toji chosen to be the Fourth Child?

134
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:38,825
All the fourth-level candidates
were in your class.

135
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:44,556
I just found out myself recently
that it was all set up.

136
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,091
All of them?

137
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,459
All of my classmates...

138
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,090
What happened with Suzuhara was a mistake
that can't be mended with words alone.

139
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,666
But, Shinji, to be honest,

140
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:58,837
I was projecting all of my dreams,
hopes and purpose onto you.

141
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,740
I also know that it's been a huge burden for you.

142
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,309
But we, everyone at Nerv,

143
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,180
had no choice except to entrust
our future to you.

144
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,481
I want you to remember that one thing.

145
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,417
That's a selfish excuse, isn't it?

146
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,552
I know it is.

147
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,456
I'll leave your pass code to HQ
and your room as they are.

148
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,647
There's no point. Get rid of them, please.

149
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,017
I won't pilot an Eva again.

150
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,540
He's speaking aggressively.

151
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,857
I've never heard him like that.

152
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:38,544
Government Only Special Express R-13
Departing 13:38 to New Atsugi

153
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:42,915
Government Only Special Express R-13
Departing 13:38 to New Atsugi
A special state of emergency has been declared
for the Tokai region.

154
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:42,981
A special state of emergency has been declared
for the Tokai region.

155
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:43,449
Evacuation Route
A special state of emergency has been declared
for the Tokai region.

156
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,516
Evacuation Route
All residents, please evacuate to your
designated shelters immediately.

157
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:47,820
All residents, please evacuate to your
designated shelters immediately.

158
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,188
Repeating...

159
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,389
An Angel!

160
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,429
All personnel, battle stations, Level One.

161
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,298
Prepare for ground-to-air intercept.

162
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,265
Target status?

163
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,867
It's currently advancing.

164
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,508
The Komagatake Defense Line
has been penetrated.

165
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,214
Armor layers one through eighteen
have been breached!

166
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,295
Eighteen layers of special armor at once?!

167
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,353
The Eva won't make it there in time
for a ground level intercept.

168
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,288
Position Unit 02 for combat
inside the Geo-Front,

169
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,399
directly in front of Headquarters.

170
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,159
Asuka will engage the target as soon
as it breaches the Geo-Front.

171
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,164
What about Unit 00?

172
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:34,245
It's been placed in the AT Field
Neutralization Zone.

173
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,835
However, the left arm hasn't been
regenerated yet.

174
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,170
Then it can't engage in combat.

175
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,401
Sortie Rei in Unit 01.

176
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,684
Prepare a dummy plug as the backup system.

177
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,289
Yes, Sir.

178
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,044
Start entry.

179
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,379
LCL electrolyzed.

180
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,840
Commence A10 nerve connection.

181
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,054
So it's not going to work anymore.

182
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,156
Pulse flow is reversing!

183
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,825
Unit O1 is rejecting the neural connections!

184
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,116
No, that can't be possible!

185
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:02,828
Ikari?

186
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,998
Yes, it's rejecting me.

187
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:11,470
Abort activation. Sortie Rei in Unit 00.

188
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,672
Re-activate Unit 01 with the dummy plug.

189
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,940
But Unit 00 isn't...

190
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:16,975
It doesn't matter. I'll go.

191
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,010
Rei?

192
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,741
Even if I die, I can be replaced.

193
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,686
I... I decided I'd never pilot it again.

194
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,437
Hey, you! What're you doing?
Get into the shelter, quickly.

195
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:32,491
It's no use!

196
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:34,862
One more hit, and all the armor layers
will have been breached!

197
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,444
I'm counting on you, Asuka.

198
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:42,968
Here it comes.

199
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:46,749
Even if Shinji isn't here, I can do this by myself.
Piece of cake!

200
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:54,983
Bastard!

201
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,037
Darn. Next!

202
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,533
I'm neutralizing its AT Field, aren't I?

203
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,024
Why won't it go down?!

204
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:19,146
I can't lose ever again!

205
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:28,137
No way!

206
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,001
You damn bastard!

207
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,728
Asuka!

208
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,339
Cut all the nerve connections now!

209
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,305
Evacuation training? What are you, stupid?

210
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:55,766
That stuff's got nothing to do with us pilots.

211
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,311
Direct hit on the Eighth District!

212
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:08,048
Abandon the Sixth Shelter! All survivors,
hurry to the Third Shelter!

213
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,656
Unit 02 is severely damaged!
It can't continue combat.

214
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:11,523
How's Asuka?

215
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,024
She's safe. Alive!
How's Asuka?

216
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:12,845
She's safe. Alive!

217
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:16,995
Damn...

218
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,964
The Angel has started moving.

219
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,015
What's Unit O1's status?

220
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,502
Dummy plug upload, complete.

221
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:24,813
Probe insertion, complete.

222
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,705
Start contact.

223
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:27,666
Roger!

224
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:29,074
What?

225
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,510
The pulses have vanished.
It's rejecting the dummy plug.

226
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,651
It's no use! Eva Unit 01 won't activate!

227
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,316
The dummy, Rei...

228
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,717
It won't accept them?

229
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,019
Fuyutsuki...

230
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,821
I'm leaving you in charge for a bit.

231
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,288
Number two and number four will be blocked off.
Please evacuate immediately.

232
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,690
Take casualties to the Sixth Block.
Number two and number four will be blocked off.
Please evacuate immediately.

233
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,792
Hurry the uninjured to the Third Shelter!
Number two and number four will be blocked off.
Please evacuate immediately.

234
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:46,993
Hurry the uninjured to the Third Shelter!

235
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:49,294
This way!

236
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:49,928
Hurry!
This way!

237
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:50,595
Hurry!
Quickly!

238
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:50,829
Quickly!

239
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,697
Hurry!

240
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,918
Hey, you! What're you doing?
Do you want to die?!

241
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:56,925
Asuka...

242
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,144
Well, if it isn't Shinji.

243
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:01,817
Mr. Kaji?

244
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:05,210
What are you doing here?

245
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,179
That's my line.

246
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,520
What are you doing here, Shinji?

247
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,450
l...

248
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,441
I'm never going to pilot an Eva again.

249
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:15,634
And since I decided that...

250
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,196
I see.

251
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:23,161
Well, since my moonlighting came out into
the open, I'm not welcome on the combat roster.

252
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,130
So, here I am, watering the plants.

253
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,732
At a time like this?

254
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:27,963
It's because it's a time like this.

255
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,069
Between Katsuragi's breasts is nice too,

256
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,180
but in the end, I want to be here when I die.

257
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,816
Die?

258
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,611
That's right.

259
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,414
It's said if an Angel makes contact
with Adam, who lies below here,

260
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:46,418
humanity will be eradicated in the Third Impact.

261
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:47,819
The only thing that can stop it

262
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,450
is the one thing with power equal
to an Angel's, the Evangelion.

263
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:54,993
Ayanami?

264
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,254
Without even a rifle?!

265
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:00,665
Does she mean to blow herself up?!

266
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,133
Rei!
Does she mean to blow herself up?!

267
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:01,484
Rei!

268
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,861
AT Field, full power.

269
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,800
What happened to Unit 00?

270
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,821
Rei!

271
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,357
What has she done?

272
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:33,797
Shinji, the only thing I can do
is stand here and water.

273
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:38,864
But you, you have something that you can do.
That only you can do.

274
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,574
Nobody is forcing you.

275
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,943
Think for yourself, and make
the decision by yourself.

276
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,113
Think about what you ought to do now.

277
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,187
You know, so you don't have any regrets.

278
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,866
Direct hit on the third foundation.

279
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,835
The final armor plate has melted!

280
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:12,056
Damn! The Main Shaft is completely exposed!

281
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,339
Isn't Unit 01 ready yet?

282
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,570
It's rejecting the dummy plug.

283
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,577
It failed! No response detected!

284
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:21,913
Keep trying. Repeat the process from step 108.

285
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,204
Let me pilot it!

286
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,660
L. ..

287
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,252
Let me pilot Unit 01, please!

288
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,647
Father...

289
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,031
Why are you here?

290
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,937
L. ..

291
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,718
I am the pilot of Evangelion Unit 01!

292
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:49,984
Shinji Ikari!

293
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:55,247
The target has invaded the Main Shaft!

294
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:56,238
It's descending!

295
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:57,616
Where is it heading?

296
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:00,051
It's advancing directly towards Central Dogma.

297
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,253
It's coming here.

298
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:02,821
All personnel evacuate. Hurry!

299
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:05,192
All personnel evacuate!
Repeat, all personnel evacuate!

300
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:20,018
Eva Unit 01?!

301
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:21,923
Shinji!

302
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,332
Miss Misato!

303
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,503
Launch number five! Hurry!

304
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,530
QOut of energy?

305
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:20,265
Unit 01 has reached its activation limit.

306
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,566
The backup isn't working either!

307
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,677
Shinji!

308
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,444
Shinji!

309
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:36,114
Move! Move! Move! Move! Come on, move!

310
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,845
There isn't any point to this
if you don't move now!

311
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:52,187
That's...

312
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,545
Move! Move! Move!

313
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:11,416
Move! Move! Move! Move! Move! Movel

314
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:14,352
Move! Move! Come on, move!

315
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:18,023
If you don't move now, if you don't do it now,
everyone's going to die!

316
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:21,059
I don't want any more of that! So...

317
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,370
PLEASE MOVE!

318
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,729
Eva has re-activated!

319
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,099
Incredible!

320
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:06,050
No way, this is unbelievable.
Unit 01's synch rate is over 400%!

321
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:09,446
Does that mean she's really awakened?

322
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,734
It's eating the Angel?

323
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:03,598
Eva Unit 01 is taking the S2 engine into herself?

324
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:26,384
The bindings!

325
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,235
Bindings?

326
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,522
That's right. That's not armor plating.

327
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:34,492
Those are restraints that allow us
to suppress the Eva's true power.

328
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,862
And now those bindings are being undone
by the Eva's own might.

329
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,523
We can no longer stop the Eva.

330
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:44,469
Unit 01's been awakened and set free.

331
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,140
Seele won't stay quiet for this.

332
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:49,272
Was this also part of your script,
Commander Ikari?

333
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,243
It's begun, hasn't it?

334
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,494
Yes, it all begins here.

335
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,487
To Be Continued

336
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,085
Preview

337
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:07,285
Preview
Mankind has been saved
by the Eva's awakening,

338
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:09,487
Mankind has been saved
by the Eva's awakening,

339
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:13,057
but Shinji is taken into Unit 01
and merges with it physically.

340
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:17,028
They try to salvage him, but fail.
What was it that the crying Misato saw?

341
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:18,129
Next time: "Form of the Mind,
Form of the Man"

342
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,697
Next Time
Form of the Mind, Form of the Man
Next time: "Form of the Mind,
Form of the Man"

343
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,068
Next Time
Form of the Mind, Form of the Man
