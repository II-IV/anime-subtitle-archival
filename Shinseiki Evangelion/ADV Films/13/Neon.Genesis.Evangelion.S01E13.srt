1
00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:06,101
Just like the cruel angel

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,870
Young boy, become a legend

3
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,990
Even though the untested breeze
taps at the door to your heart

4
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,629
You just look solely at me and smile

5
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:42,671
So intent on seeking out that gentle touch

6
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:50,760
Such innocent eyes, still ignorant
of their destiny

7
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:57,789
But someday, you are sure to realize
that upon your back

8
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:05,706
You have the wings with which to fly
towards the distant future

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,902
The cruel angel's thesis

10
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,640
Soon, you will take flight from the windowsill

11
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:18,411
With your torrent of ardent pathos

12
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:22,113
If you are to betray our memories

13
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:25,750
You, who embrace these heavens and shine

14
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:29,032
Young boy, become a legend

15
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:35,261
Apoptosis work for the three Evas
will be performed as scheduled

16
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:38,264
as soon as the Magi system is reactivated.

17
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:42,000
Operation confirmed. 450 through 670 omitted.

18
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:44,070
Command has granted approval.

19
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:46,005
Way to go, Maya. That was fast.

20
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:48,466
Of course, you're the one who trained me.

21
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:52,011
Wait a second, A-8 would be faster there.

22
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:53,302
Let me see that.

23
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,348
Impressive as ever, Ma'am!

24
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,285
How's it going? Are you finished giving
the Magi their check-up?

25
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:03,723
Pretty much. As promised,
we made it in time for today's tests.

26
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,157
That's my Ritsuko.

27
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:08,094
Considering it's a tough job with three of them.

28
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:09,405
That one's cold.

29
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:11,930
Regular Screening

30
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:12,341
Regular Screening
Done

31
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:16,736
All three Magi systems have entered
self-diagnostic mode.

32
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:19,905
127th routine maintenance, all normal.

33
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,841
Roger. Good work.

34
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,182
Everyone, take a break until the tests begin.

35
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:32,955
Everything checked out.

36
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:36,222
As usual, Mother's in good shape, but...

37
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,593
Is getting older the only thing I'm going to do?

38
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,779
Angel Invasion
Episode Thirteen

39
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,898
What? You want me to
take off my clothes again?

40
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,634
The next chamber is an
ultra-clean room environment.

41
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,504
Just taking a shower and changing
your undergarments is insufficient.

42
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:56,341
Why do I have to go through all this
for a simple autopilot test?

43
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,011
Time isn't just passing us by.

44
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,579
The technology of the Evas
is making progress as well.

45
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,661
We constantly need new data.

46
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,589
All right, here I am, just the way you wanted,

47
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,930
after being run through the wash cycle
seventeen times.

48
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,262
Now, I want all three of you to stay that way

49
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,998
as you walk through the room
and board the entry plug.

50
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,299
What?!

51
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,035
Don't worry. The video monitors
have been shut off.

52
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,137
Your privacy is protected.

53
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:29,275
That isn't the point! It's an emotional thing!

54
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,876
This test's purpose is to remove the support
of your plug suits

55
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,114
and conduct harmonics
directly from your bodies.

56
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,515
Asuka, that's an order.

57
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,326
Oh, fine! Don't you dare peek!

58
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,208
All pilots are ready for entry.

59
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,525
Start the test.

60
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:50,061
Beginning the test. Initiate autopilot recording.

61
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,930
Monitors, nominal.

62
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,512
Inserting simulation plugs.

63
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,319
Connecting simulation bodies to the system.

64
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,607
The simulation plugs are now
under the Magi's control.

65
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,446
Wow, this is going really fast!
Thank goodness for the Magi.

66
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:10,281
It's hard to believe that the first
experiment took a whole week.

67
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,393
The test is scheduled to end
in approximately three hours.

68
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,321
How does it feel?

69
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:16,722
It's a little different.

70
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,625
Yes, I think it's different than usual.

71
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,560
The sensations are kind of weird.

72
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,164
My right armis all I can feel clearly.
Everything else is fuzzy.

73
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:27,967
Rei, imagine moving your right hand.

74
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,258
Yes, Ma'am.

75
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,143
Data collection is proceeding smoothly.

76
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,078
There don't seem to be any problems so far.

77
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,569
Return the Magi to their normal state.

What are you talking about? You're the one
who created them, right?

83
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,871
You don't know anything, do you?

84
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:58,063
That's because you don't babble about
yourself like I do, Ritsuko!

85
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:01,967
That's true. I just brought the system up.

You're double-checking this?

91
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,141
Yes, just in case.

Sigma Unit D-17
87th Protein Wall

99
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,486
With magnification, you can see
something that looks like stains.

100
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,620
I wonder what they could be?

101
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,022
It's got to be corrosion.

102
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:26,025
There are slight variations in the
temperature and conduction rates.

103
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:29,195
Deterioration of sterilized rooms
is happening a lot lately.

104
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:32,498
The construction schedule was
cut by about sixty days,

105
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,767
so there were probably some air bubbles
mixed in again.

106
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:37,136
The construction of B Wing is just sloppy.

107
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:39,939
It was built after the Angels
appeared, after all.

108
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,509
It's not surprising. Everyone's exhausted.

109
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,578
Take care of it by tomorrow.

110
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,246
Otherwise we'll never hear
the end of it from lkari.

111
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,537
Roger.

112
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,386
Another water leak?

113
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,890
No, it's apparently some kind of corrosion
in the protein wall above us.

114
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,291
Wonderful.

115
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,659
Any effect on this test?

116
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,127
No, not at the moment.

117
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,729
Then, let's continue.

118
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,032
We can't abort this test over
minor technical issues.

119
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,868
We'd never hear the end of it
from Commander Ikari.

120
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,103
Roger. Synchronization value is nominal.

121
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,671
No changes to plug signals.

00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,748
Contact with Eva Unit 00 has been confirmed.

124
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,472
AT Field will be generated at output of 2 yocto.

00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,458
What's happening?!

126
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,361
We've got a contamination alert
on Floor A in the Sigma unit.

127
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:38,297
The 87th protein wall is corroding
and releasing heat.

128
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:40,666
Abnormality detected in pipe six as well.

129
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,235
Corrosion area of the protein wall increasing!

130
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,004
At an explosive rate!

131
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,438
Abort the experiment.

132
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,040
Initiate emergency shutoff of the sixth pipe.

00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:48,073
Initiate emergency shutoff of the sixth pipe.

Corrosion has occurred in 6-42.

00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:02,655
No effect! Corrosion is spreading
along the walls.

140
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:03,946
Prepare the polysomes.

141
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:12,349
Set laser power at maximum. Fire upon contact.

142
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:17,921
Corrosion has reached 6-58. It's coming!

146
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,199

147
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,159

There's no question. It's an Angel.

00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:40,885
An Angel?! You let an Angel get inside?

177
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:26,265
The contaminated area is descending further.

178
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,756
It's spreading all over Sigma Unit
from the Pribnow Box!

179
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,236
That's a bad area.

180
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:31,603
Yes, it's too close to Adam.
That's a bad area.

181
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,214
Yes, it's too close to Adam.

182
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,308
Stop the corrosion within Sigma Unit!

183
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,445
If necessary, sacrifice the Geo-Front.
What's the Evas' status?

184
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,146
Standing by in cage seven.

185
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,348
We can launch them as soon as
the pilots are recovered.

186
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,249
There's no need to wait for the pilots.
Launch them immediately.

187
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:52,057
Unit 01 has top priority.
Sacrifice the other two if necessary.

188
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,759
Unit 01?

189
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,262
But Sir, we can't physically destroy the Angel
without the Evas.

190
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:01,333
If the Evas are contaminated first,
it'll all be over. Hurry!

191
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,704
Yes, Sir!

192
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:09,370
All of Central Dogma under Sigma Unit
will be completely closed off in sixty seconds.

193
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:09,575
So that's the Angel.

194
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,076
So that's the Angel.
Thirty seconds until activation
of vacuum pump.

195
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:12,857
Guess I don't have time for work now.
Thirty seconds until activation
of vacuum pump.

196
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,655
Central Dogma has been completely sealed.

197
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:27,025
Mega-depth facilities are entirely
occupied by the intruder.

198
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,516
Well now, how will we fight an Angel
without an Eva?

199
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,443
Look, this is the border between
the normal and heavy water.

200
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:45,844
There's a higher level of oxygen here.

201
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,425
Their preference is pretty obvious.

202
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:53,852
The area where ozone is vented in to maintain
aseptic conditions isn't contaminated.

203
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,054
So does that mean that its weakness is oxygen?

204
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,344
It would seem so.

205
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:03,662
Injecting ozone.

206
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,063
Concentration is increasing.

207
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:06,887
It's working, all right.

208
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,723
Will this work?

209
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:14,106
It appears Zero A and Zero B will recover.

210
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,241
The area around the pipes
has returned to normal.

211
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,644
As expected, the central portion
is proving to be tougher.

212
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,225
All right, inject more ozone.

213
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,173
This isn't right.

214
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,886
What? It's increasing?

215
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,522
Something is wrong. Heat levels are increasing.

216
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,925
The contaminated area is spreading again.

217
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,427
It's no use! The ozone is no longer
having any effect.

218
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,796
Now it's absorbing the ozone.

219
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,087
Stop the ozonel!

220
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,034
Amazing...

221
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,344
It's evolving.

222
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,538
What's wrong?

223
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,473
Something's hacking into the sub-computer.

224
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,942
Intruder unknown.

225
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:53,478
Not now! Damn it! Dealing with C-mode.

226
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:56,615
Unfreeze the barrier. Open a decoy entry.

227
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:58,283
Decoy entry has been avoided.

228
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,651
Eighteen seconds to completion of trace.

229
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:00,642
Deploying barrier.

230
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:02,788
Barrier has been penetrated.

231
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,890
Open another false entry.

232
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,792
No human being could do this.

233
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:09,494
Trace complete. The hacker is inside this facility!

234
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,125
B Wing basement, in the Pribnow Box!

235
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,672
Optical pattern is changing.

236
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,908
Those glowing lines are electronic circuits.

237
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,776
This is just like a computer.

238
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,067
Opening decoy entry.

239
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,114
Failed. We've been blocked.

240
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,049
Sever the main cable.

241
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,051
Negative, it refuses to accept the command.

242
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,453
Fire the lasers.

243
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,324
It's generating an AT Field. No effect.

244
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:40,193
It's accessing security's main computer bank.
Cracking the password.

245
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,817
Twelfth digit... sixteenth digit...
D word has been cleared!

246
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,807
It's broken into security's main bank!

247
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,736
It's reading the main bank. We can't stop it.

248
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,704
What is its objective?

249
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,473
Scanning the main bus.

250
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,975
This code is... Oh, no!

251
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,406
It's going to infiltrate the Magi!

252
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,513
Shut down the IfO system.

253
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,521
Count it down!

254
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,756

Onel

256

We can't cut the power!

257
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,463
The Angel is intruding further.

258
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,774
It's made contact with Melchior.

259
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,981
It's no good! It's going to be taken over!

260
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:28,212
Melchior has been reprogrammed by the Angel.

261
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,410

00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,505
To think that the Magi would turn against us...

278
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:25,197
We can think of them as micro-machines.

279
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,068
Angels the size of microbes.

280
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,435
Those individuals have aggregated together

281
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,537
and have undergone explosive evolution

282
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,841
to achieve intelligence circuits
in this short amount of time.

283
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:37,442
Evolution...

284
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:38,610
Yes.

285
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,480
They're continuously changing themselves,

286
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:45,083
searching for a system that can
cope with any situation.

287
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:49,254
That's truly the system of life itself.

288
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,556
Against an enemy that evolves to
overcome its weaknesses,

289
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,726
the only effective countermeasure
is to eliminate the host

290
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,957
and let the parasite die with it.

291
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,164
We have no choice but to
have it die with the Magi.

292
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:01,733
I propose the physical elimination of the Magi.

293
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,834
That's impossible.

294
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,570
Destroying the Magi is tantamount to
destroying headquarters itself.

295
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,573
Then I officially request it on behalf
of the Operations Division.

296
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,008
I refuse.

297
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,110
This is a matter for the Technology Department.

298
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,481
Why are you being so mule-headed?!

299
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,208
This situation is a result of my carelessness.

300
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,119
You've always been like this.

301
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,321
You always take the responsibility
on your own shoulders

302
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,902
and won't depend on others.

303
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:31,730
If the Angel keeps evolving, we have a chance.

304
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,432
Expedite its evolution?

305
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,599
Yes.

306
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,303
The end of evolution is self-destruction.
Death itself.

307
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:41,704
Thus, we just need to accelerate its evolution.

308
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:45,544
If the Angel considers it the only
practical means of survival,

309
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:48,146
it may choose to co-exist with the Magi system.

310
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,047
But how?

If Casper is contaminated as well, it'll all be over.

322
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,878
I'll keep my promise.

323
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:23,048
Alert R issued! Alert R issued!

324
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:26,852
An emergency has occurred
in Nerv Headquarters.

325

All D-class personnel must evacuate.

What is all this?

327
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,309
Scribbles left by the developer.

328
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:55,747
Amazing! These are back doors!
Magi's back doors!

329
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,268
So it's a veritable encyclopedia
of all the tricks up the Magi's sleeve.

330
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,219
Is it okay to see these?

331
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,180
What a surprise! This is INT-C!

332
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:08,982
With these we can program much faster
than we thought, right, Ma‘am?

333
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:12,329
Ikari, you jerk!

334

Thank you, Mother.
We can make it for sure now.

335
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:16,018
Ikari, you jerk!

336
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,469
Give me the wrench.

341
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,236
And not a very interesting one, at that.

342
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,971
Do you know about personality transplant OS?

343
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:56,374
Yes, it's a system that implants
an individual's personality

344
00:17:56,375 --> 00:18:00,011
into a seventh generation organic computer
so it can think.

345
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:03,248
It's the same technology used
for operating the Evas, right?

346
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,389
I've heard Magi was the first of them.

347
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,546
My mother developed the technology.

348
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,393
So, it was her personality that was implanted?

349
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,684

350
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:30,069
In a very real sense, this is my mother's brain.

351
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:34,279
Is that why you wanted to protect the Magi?

352
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,149
I don't think so. I didn't really
like my mother that much.

353
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,324
This was a decision as a scientist.

354
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,922
There it is!

355
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:45,733
Balthasar has been taken over!

356
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:49,995
Independent self-destruct has been approved
by the artificial intelligence.

357
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:50,462
Has it begun?!

358
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,262
Has it begun?!

Self-destruct device will be triggered 02 seconds
after the consent of all three members.

360
00:18:55,301 --> 00:19:00,301

365
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,572

00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,523
Twenty seconds to self-destruct.

367
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,491
Not good!

368
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,993
Casper will be taken over in eighteen seconds!

369
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,397
Fifteen seconds to self-destruct.

370
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:26,698
Ritsuko, hurry!

371
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:29,567
No problem. I've got almost
one whole second to spare.
Ten seconds to self-destruct.

372
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:29,768
Only one?!

373
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:30,935
Only one?!

394
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,300
Jeez, I can't go anywhere naked!

395
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:31,725
Somebody hurry up and help me!

396
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,110
Sigma Unit released. T minus zero three
to Magi system reactivation.

397
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:44,676
Maybe I'm getting old. Staying up for
these all-nighters is rough.

398
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:47,545
You kept your promise again.

399
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,147
Good job.

400
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:50,437
Thank you.

401
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:58,781
This is the first time I've ever really
appreciated your coffee.

402
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,261
The night before she died,
my mother told me

403
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,222
that the Magi are three aspects of herself.

404
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,433
Herself as a scientist.

405
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,001
Herself as a mother.

406
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,770
Herself as a woman.

407
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:15,373
The Magi is those three aspects
struggling for dominance.

408
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,774
She intentionally left in the dilemmas
of human experience.

409
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:21,171
Actually, each of the three programs
are slightly different.

410
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,717
I don't think I'll ever be a mother,

411
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:28,286
so l don't understand her as a mother.

412
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,097
But I respected her as a scientist.

413
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,944
However, as a woman, I even hated her.

414
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,297
You're rather talkative today.

415
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,588
It's been known to happen.

416
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:49,868
Casper contains the pattern of her as a woman.

417
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:54,676
She stayed a woman to the last.
How totally like my mother.

418
00:21:55,915 --> 00:22:00,254
