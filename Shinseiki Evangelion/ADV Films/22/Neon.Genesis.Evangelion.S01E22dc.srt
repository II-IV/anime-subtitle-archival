1
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:07,278
Man, I guess we will be in Japan by tomorrow.

2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,199
And Misato said she'd come
pick me up by lunch.

3
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:16,018
Oh, Misato's the person who was
in Germany before you, Mr. Kaji.

4
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,151
I don't really like her much.

5
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:21,883
The way she lives is so affected.

6
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:28,727
Man, I guess this is going to be
goodbye for a while.

7
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:30,159
That's so boring!

8
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:35,295
Once you get to Japan, I'm sure you'll
make lots of new boyfriends.

9
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:38,992
I hear the Third Child is a boy.

10
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:44,416
I'm not interested in stupid brats!

11
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,801
You're the only one I love, Kaji.

12
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:52,652
Well, that's quite an honor.

13
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:56,656
I mean it! If it's with you, it's all totally okay!

14
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:58,647
Kissing and even the stuff after that!

15
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,564
Asuka, you're still a child.

16
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,513
Those things can wait until
you grow up a little.

17
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,716
What?! That's no fun!

18
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:12,170
I'm already grown up enough!

19
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:13,705
I'm already a grownup!

20
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:15,508
I'm a grownup! I'm a grownup!

21
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,089
So look at mel

22
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,217
The hypothetical became reality.

23
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:28,920
Talk about unlucky, the proponent
becoming the test subject herself.

24
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,592
Then, that contact experiment
was the direct cause?

25
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,661
Mental breakdown, that was
the result of the contact.

26
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:39,532
But how cruel is it to commit suicide,
leaving such a young daughter behind?

27
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:42,783
No, there might actually be
more to this than that.

28
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:49,475
Asuka, dear, your mom cooked
your favorite dish today.

29
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:53,979
Come on, if you're picky about your food,
that big girl over there is going to laugh at you.

30
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:56,048
She goes on like that every day.

31
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,618
She talks to the doll, thinking it's her daughter.

32
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,554
She probably feels responsible in her own way.

33
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:05,725
Her research filled her days and she had no time
to pay attention to our daughter.

34
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,994
You have my sympathies.

35
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:10,763
But the way she is, they're
practically a family of dolls.

36
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:14,104
No, perhaps humans and dolls
are not so different.

37
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:19,122
Humans made dolls in their own image.

38
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,111
If God exists, we may be nothing more
than dolls to Him.

39
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:28,132
I'm surprised to hear such words from
a practitioner of modern medicine.

40
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:32,972
I’m just another human before I’'m a doctor,
a flesh and blood woman.

41
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,234
You're such a good girl, Asuka.

42
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:51,103
It's okay, you don't have to hold it in, you know?

43
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:54,534
It's okay. I'm not going to cry.
1'm going to think for myself.

44
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,511
Can you hear me, Asuka?

45
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,212
Your synch rate is down by eight points.

46
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,214
As always, keep your mind off other things.

47
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,035
I'm doing it!

48
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,740
At Least, Be Human
Episode Twenty-Two

49
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:10,956
Asuka's synch rate has been
on a downward trend lately.

50
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,926
It's problematic, considering our tight situation.

51
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,295
Let's make Rei's Unit 00 our priority.

52
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,876
Right now, we don't have the leeway
to repair both at the same time.

53
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:25,704
Mitosis in Unit 02's left arm has
cleared the target value.

54
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,396
Necrosis is currently under
point zero five percent.

55
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:31,777
The apoptosis process is operating normally.

56
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:35,147
Unit 00's morphogenetic system
is currently stable.

57
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,838
Please connect receptors to Signal 2.

58
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,514
The Eva series, born from Adam.

59
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:48,460
We even have to make use of what
caused the Second Impact

60
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,529
in order for us to win against the Angels.

61
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,597
Put it another way, in order to live,

62
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,868
we will even use the thing
that tried to wipe us out.

63
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,479
I guess that's what humans do.

64
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:00,695
In the end, maybe I do hate the Eva.

65
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,945
My father's murderer...

66
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,687
Miss Katsuragi!

67
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,847
Construction of Evas up through
Unit 13 has begun?

68
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,616
In seven different locations around the world?

69
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,351
This information came via Shanghai.

70
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,220
The source can be trusted.

71
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:16,689
Why are they rushing mass production
at this stage?

72
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,760
We've lost two Evas in the past and
two are currently heavily damaged.

73
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,728
Perhaps they're rushing
to reinforce our reserves

74
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,263
with an eye towards the
secondary preparations.

75
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,865
I don't know.

76
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,367
Even here, we're getting Germany
to give us parts

77
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,388
from Unit 05 and 06 that are
being built there.

78
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,873
There seems to be a lot of money
changing hands lately.

79
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:36,475
Our budget was doubled since
we came here after all.

80
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,612
Do you suppose that just shows
how desperate the higher-ups are?

81
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,073
I sense a certain impatience on
the part of the Committee.

82
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,618
Then are they anticipating a case
where not single,

83
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:49,188
but multiple Angels are deployed
against us at once?

84
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:53,379
Maybe, but there's no reason to do it unofficially.

85
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,237
They must have some other objective in mind.

86
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:05,603
The telephone number you just dialed
is currently not in use.

87
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,969
That's strange. I still can't get through.

88
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,301
I wonder if he went away somewhere again?

89
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,583
A train will presently be arriving in Terminal 2.

90
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:20,954
For your safety, please wait
behind the white line.

91
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:27,534
He was melted into his Eva for
a whole month until just the other day.

92
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,558
What's with him? He's totally back
to his usual thing again.

93
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,179
Fine, so I've lost.

94
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:36,892
You're just a...

95
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,129
All three of us are here for once
and we're just so awkward.

96
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,539
I'm done.

97
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:10,636
Asuka!

98
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:13,772
No way! It's just going to be
another call from Kaji for you!

99
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,203
You answer it!

100
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,246
That's not likely.

101
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:27,052
Oh, my, the great invincible Shiniji,
lowering himself to such a menial chore.

102
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,021
Thank you so very much.

103
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,312
Yes, hello?

104
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,224
What's with his prissy attitude?

105
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:38,831
An international call from Germany for you.

106
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,132
It's your mother.

107
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,883
For me? From Mom?

108
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,195
Give it here!

109
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,945
When she's talking in a language
I don't understand,

110
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,846
it's like she becomes a total stranger.

111
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,757
A mother?

112
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:23,475
You sure talked for a long time.

113
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:26,512
Well, it's our usual bit of communication.

114
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,614
It must be nice to have a family to talk to.

115
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,195
Well, just in appearance. It's only on the surface.

116
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,508
She's not my real mother anyway.

117
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,189
But it's not like I hate her.

118
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,710
I just don't deal with her well.

119
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,361
Why the hell am [ telling you all this?!

120
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:43,796
Sorry.

121
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,987
It's all over if even you start
sympathizing with me!

122
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,014
It makes me sick.

123
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:04,025
Like hell I'll bathe in water that
Misato and stupid Shinji used.

124
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:10,556
Like hell I'll use a washer that Misato
and stupid Shinji used

125
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,017
to wash their underwear.

126
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:18,411
Like hell I'll sit on a toilet that Misato
and stupid Shinji used.

127
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,114
Like hell I'll breathe the same air
as Misato and stupid Shiniji.

128
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:30,209
I hate Misato! I hate Shinji!

129
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,849
And I hate the First Child even more!

130
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:36,382
I hate Dad! I hate Mom!

131
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,753
But I hate myself the most!

132
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,893
I hate this! I can't stand it anymore!

133
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:45,305
Why do I have to... Why me?!

134
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,499
She's at negative twelve point eight
on the synch index,

135
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,300
just barely above the activation level.

136
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,969
That's terrible.

137
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,610
She's dropped off even more than yesterday.

138
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,408
Asuka isn't feeling well today.
She's on her second day.

139
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,479
The synch rate isn't affected by
superficial physical conditions.

140
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,553
The problem lies more in the subconscious.

141
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:12,818
We may have no choice but to
change the core of Unit 02.

142
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,488
Asuka, you can come up.

143
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,757
Repair work on Power Grid 8 is scheduled
to begin at 1800 today.

144
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,793
Asuka's pride is in pieces.
Repair work on Power Grid 8 is scheduled
to begin at 1800 today.

145
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:21,026
Asuka's pride is in pieces.

146
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:24,363
The regular meeting concerning
the disposal issue
It's not surprising, considering how she lost.

147
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,498
of Command Center 1 will be
held on schedule.
Or rather, the fact she thinks she
lost to Shinji looms larger.

148
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,033
General Affairs managers, please come
to Conference Room 2.
Or rather, the fact she thinks she
lost to Shinji looms larger.

149
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:28,967
General Affairs managers, please come
to Conference Room 2.

150
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:29,968
General Affairs managers, please come
to Conference Room 2.
Maybe the three of us living together
has reached the limit.

151
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,079
Maybe the three of us living together
has reached the limit.

152
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,540
Threshold exceeded?

153
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,381
Is this the end of your merry game of house?

154
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,857
I don't want to hear that from someone
who keeps a cat to keep loneliness at bay.

155
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,377
I'm sorry, I guess I'm on edge.

156
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:51,644
Why do I have to go through this just
because I'm a woman?!

157
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,719
I don't even want kids!

158
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,565
Route Loop 7 is currently closed
due to an accident.

159
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:02,256
Please use the detour via Route 12.

160
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,978
The Eva won't move unless you open your heart.

161
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,549
Are you saying that my heart is closed?!

162
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,737
Yes, the Evas have souls.

163
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:13,028
Those puppets?!

164
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,440
You should know that.

165
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,276
Fancy you starting up a conversation!

166
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,057
Maybe it'll snow tomorrow!

167
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:24,683
What?! Are you so happy that
I can't pilot my Eva?!

168
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,019
There's nothing to worry about!
If another Angel attacks us,

169
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,322
the great, invincible Shinji will
take care of it for us!

170
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,524
We don't have to do anything!

171
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,574
All they need is Shinijil

172
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:40,465
First, I get Shinji's sympathy, and now,
even from the mechanical puppet girl.

173
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,576
I've really lost my edge.

174
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,870
I am not a puppet.

175
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,773
Shut up! You do whatever you're told!

176
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:50,676
You'd die if Commander lkari
told you to, wouldn't you?!

177
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:51,757
That's right.

178
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,848
You really ARE a puppet!

179
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:00,039
I've always really hated you because
you're so much like a puppet!

180
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,321
Everyone! I hate everyonel!

181
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,587
Shinji didn't show up today either.

182
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,108
Though Ayanami's absence is normal.

183
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,710
Asuka didn't come either.

184
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,881
And Suzuhara's still in the hospital.

185
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,760
I guess school isn't much of a priority right now.

186
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,453
Signal from Eva Unit 02 showing no problems.

187
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,655
VA connection and fusion are normal.

188
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:38,357
Rate of proliferation is within expected limits.

189
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:41,667
So, you're finally back to normal
after losing like that!

190
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:47,289
You're my puppet, so all you have to do
is quietly do as I say!

191
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,303
Why does a weapon need a soul anyway?!

192
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:52,764
It only gets in the way!

193
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,520
Anyway, all you have to do is obey my orders.

194
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:01,907
This is so stupid.

195
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,218
All hands, battle stations, level one!

196
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:07,986
Prepare for anti-air combat!

197
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,156
An Angel?! They're still coming?!

198
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:13,702
Angel, visually confirmed.

199
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,128
Here is the highest magpnification.

200
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,563
It isn't budging from its satellite orbit.

201
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,166
It's maintaining a set distance from our location.

202
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,603
Which means, it's waiting for a chance
to descend and close in,

203
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:27,306
or it can attack us without the need to do so.

204
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,007
We can't make a careless move at this rate.

205
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:33,532
Either way, we can't do anything about it
unless the target moves within our firing range.

206
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,367
The Eva units aren't capable of
attacking anything in orbit.

207
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:39,651
How's Rei?

208
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,154
She's in good shape, along with Unit 00.
She's ready to go.

209
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,255
Roger that.

210
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,623
Launch Unit 00!

211
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:45,994
Prepare for extreme long range firing.

212
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,661
Unit 02 and Asuka will stand by
for launch as backup!

213
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,631
Backup?! Me?! To Unit 00?!

214
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:54,599
That's right, take the rear position.

215
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,350
You have got to be joking!
Eva Unit 02, taking off!

216
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:00,642
Asuka!

217
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,776
That's fine, we'll let her take the lead.

218
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:05,887
Major Katsuragi!

219
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,115
Meaning, this is the end for Asuka
if she can't perform now.

220
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:11,516
Her last chance, then?

221
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,754
We'll have to think about
a replacement pilot for Unit 02.

222
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:16,588
Yes, Ma'am.

223
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,459
Aren't we sending out Unit 01?

224
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,139
It's been put on suspension under
Commander Ikari's strict orders.

225
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,094
I suppose it's not surprising
after what happened.

226
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:27,696
Inspection
Division

227
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:51,390
If I mess this up, they'll probably
take me off Unit 02.

228
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,320
No mistakes allowed, Asuka.

229
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:06,367
Target is still outside firing range.

230
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:09,746
Oh, hurry up and get over here already!
Talk about irritating!

231
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,424
Warning

232
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:18,717
Is it a direct energy weapon?!

233
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,485
No, I'm not getting any thermal energy readings.

234
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,053
Her psychograph readings are agitated!

235
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,514
Mental contamination beginning!

236
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,191
The Angel is launching a psychological attack?

237
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,562
They can comprehend the mind
of a human being?

238
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,543
Goddamn it!

239
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:41,506
Positrons have dissipated!

240
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,406
No good! It's outside the firing range!

241
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,720
Unit 02, out of rifle ammunition!

242
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,122
Analysis of the ray of light?!

243
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,957
It's an energy wave within the visible spectrum!

244
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,893
It's similar to the AT Field,
but details are unknown!

245
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:02,474
What about Asuka?

246
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:05,182
She's in danger! The mental
contamination has entered Y!

247
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,689
No!

248
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:14,668
Don't... Don't come inside me!

249
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:15,294
It hurts

250
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,405
It hurts!

251
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:21,546
Don't come in!

252
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:22,657
It hurts!

253
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:26,539
Stop it

254
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:31,477
Don't come inside

255
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:35,160
No!

256
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,031
No!

257
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:38,630
It hurts

258
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:39,651
No!

259
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:41,867
Mother

260
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:42,768
No!

261
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,479
Don't look inside my mind!

262
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,808
Please! Don't dig deeper into my heart!

263
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:50,575
Asuka!

264
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,310
Her psychograph readings are at their limit!

265
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,513
Her mental circuits are being torn to shreds.

266
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,448
It'll be too dangerous if they're
overloaded any more.

267
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:57,649
Asuka, come back!

268
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,817
No!

269
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,552
That's an order! Asuka, retreat!

270
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:02,354
No! Never!

271
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,123
I'd rather die here than go back now!

272
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:05,993
Asuka!

273
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,159
Accelerator being aligned.

274
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,328
Voltage increasing, approaching pressurization.

275
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,930
Forced convergence, activated.

276
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:15,000
Adjusting zero point zero three
for Earth's rotation and gravity.

277
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:17,168
Superconductive guidance system in operation.

278
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,904
Chamber at maximum pressure.

279
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,338
Final safety released!

280
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,272
Release confirmed.

281
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,533
Everything in launch position!

282
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:33,552
It's no good! The power level is far too low
to penetrate the AT Field at this range!

283
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,922
But output is at maximum! Anything more is...

284
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,257
Unit 02, psychograph readings
are growing weaker!

285
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,026
What about the LCL's psychological barrier?!

286
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:43,461
It's no use. It's not even working as a catalyst!

287
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:46,731
Prioritize life support. Shut out
the feedback from the Eva.

288
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,522
Yes, Ma'am.

289
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:51,488
It's as if this light is probing Asuka's
psychological wavelength.

290
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,265
Could it be that the Angel is trying
to learn about the human mind?!

291
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,334
Why am I crying?

292
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,386
I already decided I wouldn't cry anymore.

293
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,960
What's the matter, Asuka?

294
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:18,151
It's a present from your new mom.
Don't you like it?

295
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,321
It's okay.

296
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,133
What's okay?

297
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,802
I'm not a child!

298
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,337
1'm going to grow up quickly.

299
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,328
I don't need stuffed animals.

300
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,240
So look at mel

301
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,731
Mom! Please, don't quit being my mom!

302
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:33,511
Die with me.

303
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,702
Mom! Mom! Please don't kill me!

304
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,784
No! I'm not your doll!

305
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,253
I'm going to think and live for myself!

306
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,956
I don't need a mom or a dad.
1'm going to live on my own.

307
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,092
No, don't make me remember this!

308
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:49,828
I'd forgotten about it! Don't dig it up again!

309
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,230
I don't need any of this bad stuff anymore!

310
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,751
Stop it already! Stop it!

311
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:58,208
Then, please, Asuka.

312
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,240
Die with me.

313
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,843
Okay, I'll die with you, Mom.

314
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:08,313
So, please don't quit being my mom!
Okay, Mom?!

315
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,814
Mom?

316
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,155
I don't know what you mean.

317
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:13,708
Who are you?

318
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:19,257
I'm Asuka Langley Sohryu. Nice to meet you.

319
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,428
What are you, stupid?

320
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:22,894
This is my chance!

321
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,125
So look at mel

322
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:27,234
No! This isn't me!

323
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:33,038
I'm Asuka Langley Sohryu. Nice to meet you.

324
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,806
What are you, stupid?

325
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,474
This is my chance.

326
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,675
So look at me.

327
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,654
No! This isn't me!

328
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:46,384
I'm Asuka Langley Sohryu. Nice to meet you.

329
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,219
What are you, stupid?!

330
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,988
This is my chance.

331
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,329
So look at mel

332
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:54,541
No! This isn't me!

333
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:59,664
I'm Asuka Langley Sohryu. Nice to meet you.

334
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,700
What are you, stupid?

335
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,468
This is my chance.

336
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:04,779
So look at mel

337
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,858
No! This isn't me!

338
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:13,178
I'm Asuka Langley Sohryu. Nice to meet you.

339
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:15,080
What are you, stupid?!

340
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,548
This is my chance.

341
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,039
So look at mel

342
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,458
No! This isn't me!

343
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,937
Help me! Help me, Mr. Kaji!

344
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,954
Asuka, you're still a child.

345
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,801
Why are you there?!

346
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,629
You won't do anything! You won't help me!

347
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,898
You won't even hold mel

348
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:09,768
No one! No one! No one!

349
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,379
So look at mel

350
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:19,684
Are you lonely?

351
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,438
Are you lonely?

352
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:27,212
No!

353
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:29,226
Stay away from me!

354
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:30,378
1'm going to live on my own!

355
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:30,655
What are you, stupid?
1'm going to live on my own!

356
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:31,206
1'm going to live on my own!

357
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,344
Say, do you love me?

358
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:36,561
I won't rely on anyonel!

359
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,226
Do you really love me?

360
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,416
I can live on my own!

361
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:44,709
You big liar.

362
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:45,570
Denial

363
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:45,603
Father
No!

364
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:45,670
No!

365
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:45,703
Mother
No!

366
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:45,737
No!

367
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:45,770
Privation
No!

368
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:45,837

No!

370
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:45,904
No!

371
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:45,937
Separation
No!

372
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:46,004
No!

373
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:46,037
Evasion
No!

374
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:46,070

No!

376
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:46,171
No!

377
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:46,204
Obsessive-Compulsive
No!

378
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:46,237
No!

No!

380
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:46,337
No!

381
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:46,371
Dependence
No!

382
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:46,404
No!

383
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:46,437
Emptiness
No!

384
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:46,504
No!

Pity
No!

388
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:46,671
No!

389
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:46,704
I Am Not a Doll
No!

390
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:46,738
No!

391
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:46,771
Mental Contamination
No!

392
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:46,838
No!

393
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:46,871
Don't violate me!
No!

394
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:46,905
No!

395
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:46,938
Stop it!
No!

396
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:47,005
No!

397
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:47,038
Die with me
No!

398
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:47,071
No!

399
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:47,105
Nol!
No!

400
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:47,172
No!

401
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:47,205
It hurts!
No!

402
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:47,238
No!

403
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:47,272
I hate you so much!
No!

404
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:47,338
No!

405
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:47,372
Presumption
No!

406
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:47,405
No!

407
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:47,438
Dormant
No!

408
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:47,505
No!

409
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:47,539
Masculine Protest
No!

410
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:47,672
No!

411
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:47,705
Clearly Present
No!

412
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:47,739
No!

413
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:47,772
Reactive Formation
No!

414
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:47,839
No!

415
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:47,872
Shadow
No!

416
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:47,906
No!

417
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:47,939
Opposition
No!

418
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,006
No!

419
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:48,039
Reparations
No!

420
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,173
No!

421
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:48,206
Momentary Assimilation
No!

422
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:48,339
No!

423
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:48,373
Rationalization
No!

424
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:48,406
No!

425
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:48,439
Oblivion
No!

426
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:48,506
No!

427
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:48,540
Deception
No!

428
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:48,573
No!

429
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:48,606
Reason for Existing
No!

430
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:48,673
No!

431
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:48,706
Confidence
No!

432
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:48,740
No!

433
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:48,773
Childhood Experiences
No!

434
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:48,840
No!

435
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:48,873
Sense of Loss
No!

436
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:48,907
No!

437
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:48,940
Reparations
No!

438
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:49,007
No!

439
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:49,040
Coexistence
No!

440
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:49,073
No!

441
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:49,107
Hostility
No!

442
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:49,174
No!

443
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:49,207
Oppression
No!

444
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:49,240
No!

445
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:49,274
Death
No!

446
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:49,340
No!

447
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:49,374
Death
No!

448
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:49,695
No!

449
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:55,982
My mind's been defiled.

450
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:02,612
Mr. Kaji, I've been defiled.

451
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,723
What will I do? I've been defiled.

452
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,132
Unit 02 has shut down!

453
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:16,034
Life support has developed a problem.

454
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:17,555
Pilot entering a dangerous state!

455
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,671
No change in target.

456
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,706
Relative distance has remained the same.

457
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:25,577
Probability of it moving within firing range
of Unit 00 is point zero two percent.

458
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:29,781
Should we transport Unit 00 into the air
and snipe it from there?

459
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:31,049
No, that won't work.

460
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,051
It'll all be over if we get shot down
on the approach.

461
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:34,341
I'll go out there in Unit 01!

462
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:38,717
No! The target corrodes the pilot's psyche.

463
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,928
Right now, we must avoid
the corrosion of Unit 01.

464
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:46,097
Then I just have to keep from getting hit, right?!

465
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,398
Your success is not guaranteed.

466
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,667
But at this rate, Asuka will...

467
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:52,971
I don't care. Rei, go down into Dogma
and use the Lance.

468
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:54,639
The Lance of Longinus?!

469
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,750
Ikari, that is...

470
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:00,155
We cannot reach the target's AT Field in orbit,
and that's the only way to bring it down.

471
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:02,347
Hurry!

472
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:06,918
But contact between an Eva and Adam
might cause the Third Impact!

473
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,253
It's far too dangerous!

474
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:09,833
Commander lkari, please don't do this!

475
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,660
A lie, so it was a deception.

476
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,204
Contact with an Angel was not the cause
of the Second Impact then.

477
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:24,273
Central Dogma, levels ten to fifteen
have been unlocked.

478
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:28,221
Unit 00 has passed through
the sixth trench of the Malebolge.

479
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,928
Levels sixteen to twenty
have now been unlocked.

480
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:36,014
So the Third Impact won't happen.
At least, not because of this.

481
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,706
Then what caused the Second Impact?

482
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,460
Ikari, are we not getting ahead of ourselves?

483
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:52,011
The Committee has already started
mass-producing the Eva series.

484
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,532
This is our chance, Fuyutsuki.

485
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,301
But this is...

486
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:58,171
We cannot turn back time,

487
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,958
but we do have the power to spur it onward.

488
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,913
The old men will not stand for this!

489
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,524
We must finish everything before
Seele begins to act.

490
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:25,763
It would be unwise for us
to lose Unit 02 right now.

491
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:29,863
That may be, but using the Lance of Longinus
without Seele's permission will be troublesome.

492
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:34,906
A reason need only exist.
Anything beyond that is insignificant.

493
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:38,037
A reason? What you're looking for
is an excuse, isn't it?

494
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,746
Brain waves of Unit 02 pilot have
dropped to zero point zero six!

495
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:43,715
Life support reaching a critical point!

496
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:45,825
Unit 00 has passed through Number 2,
emerging on surface.

497
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,794
So, that's the Lance of Longinus.

498
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:58,763
Unit 00, prepared to throw.

499
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:00,898
Target confirmed. Adjustment for errors made.

500
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,433
Beginning countdown.

501
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:03,543
T-minus ten seconds.

502
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:05,503
Eight...

503
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,738
Seven...

504
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:07,872
Six...

505
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,107
Five...

506
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:10,341
Four...

507
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,509
Three...

508
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,510
Two...

509
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,478
One...

510
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:14,469
Zerol

511
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,967
Target has been destroyed.

512
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:38,036
Eva Unit 02 disengaged.

513
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,737
What about the Lance of Longinus?

514
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,472
It broke the first astronautical velocity.

515
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,203
It is currently moving into lunar orbit.

516
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,943
Recovering it will be nearly impossible.

517
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:49,514
Yes, at present, we do not have the means
to bring back that much mass.

518
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:05,797
Unit 02 is in good condition.
Readings currently at normal levels.

519
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:07,732
Bring the Eva back to Cage 2.

520
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,633
Please use Route 67.

521
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:12,170
What about Asuka?

522
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:14,272
Pilot's life signs confirmed.

523
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:16,703
Quarantine due to the contamination
has been removed.

524
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:18,776
I see.

525
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:27,765
Do Not Enter

526
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:35,860
I'm glad for you, Asuka.

527
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:38,596
Shut up! There's nothing to be glad about!

528
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,899
Of all the people, she had to be
the one to save mel

529
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,469
I had to be saved by HER!

530
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,190
I would've rather died than be saved by her!
