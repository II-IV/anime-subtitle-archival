1
00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:06,602
Just like the cruel angel

2
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:14,281
Young boy, become a legend

3
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:28,390
Even though the untested breeze
taps at the door to your heart

4
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:36,690
You just look solely at me and smile

5
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:43,171
So intent on seeking out that gentle touch

6
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:51,182
Such innocent eyes, still ignorant
of their destiny

7
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:58,189
But someday, you are sure to realize
that upon your back

8
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:06,107
You have the wings with which to fly
towards the distant future

9
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:11,304
The cruel angel's thesis

10
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:15,041
Soon, you will take flight from the windowsill

11
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:18,811
With your torrent of ardent pathos

12
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:22,515
If you are to betray our memories

13
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:26,152
You, who embrace these heavens and shine

14
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:29,433
Young boy, become a legend

15
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,328
It's eating the Angel?

16
00:01:57,384 --> 00:02:01,387
And now those bindings are being undone
by the Eva's own might.

17
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:03,938
We can no longer stop the Eva.

18
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,495
Unit 01's been awakened and set free.

19
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,956
Seele won't stay quiet for this.

20
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,670
The Eva series aren't capable of
generating S2 engines themselves.

21
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,940
We never imagined it would take one
into itself this way.

22
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:25,578
This incident is at extreme odds with our script.

23
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,579
It will not be easy to correct for this.

24
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:32,581
Were we not mistaken to have entrusted Nerv
to Gendo lkari in the first place?

25
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:37,819
But without that man, we could not have
executed all of our plans.

26
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:40,859
Ikari, what are you thinking?

27
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:42,261
It's begun, hasn't it?

28
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,452
Yes, it all begins here.

29
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,472
Form of the Mind
Form of the Man
Episode
Twenty

30
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,040
Damage on both Eva units
is beyond the Hayflick Limit.

31
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,543
1t'll take time before everything
goes back to normal.

32
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:00,094
Fortunately, the Magi System can be transferred.

33
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,924
We'll start working on that as early as tomorrow.

34
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,685
But this place will have to be scrapped.

35
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,387
It's just a matter of time before
the brass decides to abandon it.

36
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,789
That's true.

37
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,959
For the time being, we'll have to use
the backup Secondary Control Center.

38
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,128
You mean, even without the Magi?

39
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,630
That's right.

40
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:20,733
We'll dust it off and be working again
by this afternoon.

41
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:23,202
But these chairs are hard, and the sensors
haven't been broken in,

42
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,171
so it's difficult to work here.

43
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:28,474
Even though the layout is the same as
the control center we're familiar with.

44
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,076
It just doesn't feel right, you know?

45
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,687
At least we can use this place.

46
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:35,473
But what we don't know is whether
we can still use Unit 01.

47
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:44,623
Restrained by the cage... are you sure it's safe?

48
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:49,561
No internal thermal, electron, electromagnetic,
or chemical energy readings are being detected.

49
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,797
The S2 engine is completely inactive.

50
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:55,018
Nevertheless, under those conditions, Unit 01
has moved on three separate occasions.

51
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:03,341
You can't treat it carelessly based only
on what we can see and measure.

52
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:06,612
We don't know what it'll do if
we meddle with it carelessly.

53
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,163
Just like you, Miss Katsuragi.

54
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,819
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,123
However, our concerns are not
limited to Unit 01.

56
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:20,059
Correct. Serious damage was sustained
by Units 00 and 02.

57
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,729
Headquarters was partially destroyed,
Central Dogma exposed.

58
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,464
The damages are enormous.

59
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:29,668
We can't even estimate how much
money and time we've lost.

60
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,605
All this is because we didn't put
a bell around Ikari's neck.

61
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,407
There is a bell, it just didn't ring.

62
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,510
A bell that doesn't ring serves no purpose.

63
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,351
We'll have the bell take action next time.

64
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,919
My, my, what an unexpected turn of events.

65
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:48,535
The committee...  mean, how do you
intend to explain this to Seele?

66
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:53,058
Unit 01 wasn't under our control.

67
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,161
This was an unexpected accident.

68
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:59,165
Therefore Unit 01 will stay frozen until
the Committee gives us further orders.

69
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,000
That's a very appropriate decision.

70
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,611
However, is your son still trapped inside it?

71
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:10,342
As expected, it's not working. The code to
eject the entry plug isn't being accepted.

72
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,844
What about the backup and dummy signals?

73
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,505
They're being refused. We can't open
a direct circuit either.

74
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,716
We've connected to the plug's video monitor.

75
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,056
Switching to the main monitor.

76
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,844
What in the hell is this?

77
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,492
This is the truth behind the 400% synch rate.

78
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,762
I can't believe it. What in the world
happened to Shinji?

79
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,231
He's been taken into Eva Unit 01.

80
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:35,067
What does that mean?! Just what is an Eva?!

81
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:38,537
It is something created by man
in man's own image.

82
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:39,972
I really can't describe it any other way.

83
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,373
Something created by man?

84
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:45,778
Didn't you just copy what you found then
at the South Pole?

85
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,613
I'm sure the original would be
appalled to hear this.

86
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:51,517
This is not just a copy, because
it is imbued with a human will.

87
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,619
Are you saying somebody
willed this to happen as well?!

88
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,910
It could be the Eva's...

89
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,324
Do something, damn you!

90
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:01,315
You created it, didn't you?!
Take responsibility for it!

91
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,866
On the issue of the Nansa Islands,

92
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,835
the government has officially announced
there is no federal involvement.

93
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:14,836
In other news, it has been a month
since the terrorist act in Tokyo-2,

94
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,743
and the government has passed
new legislation to prevent another.

95
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:18,734
I am still alive.
and the government has passed
new legislation to prevent another.

96
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,816
I got that she made it, okay?!

97
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:27,097
Damn it, Misato, don't keep calling me
over every little thing!

98
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:34,593
To think... to think I couldn't do anything!

99
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,844
I can't believe I lost to that stupid Shinji!

100
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,455
I hate this!

101
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:44,303
A plan to salvage Shinji?

102
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:48,340
That's right. That which can be called
Shinji's life still exists.

103
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,376
Now you're respecting human life?

104
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:52,745
We can't afford to lose Shinji right now.

105
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:53,913
Well, I wonder?

106
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:58,550
Isn't what Nerv wants not Shinji's life,
but Unit 01 as its tool?

107
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,361
I won't deny it.

108
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:04,223
We can surmise that Shinji's body
lost its ego border,

109
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:08,160
and he's floating in the entry plug
in quantum form.

110
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:13,132
In other words, Shinji has shifted
into a form we can't see?

111
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:16,302
Yes, the composition of the LCL inside the plug
has chemically altered

112
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:21,040
into something very similar to the
sea water of primitive Earth.

113
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,808
A soup of life, huh?

114
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:27,079
All of the substances which composed Shiniji
are still preserved in the plug,

115
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,949
and what could be called his soul
exists there as well.

116
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:34,219
In fact, his self-image is pseudo-
substantiating his plug suit.

117
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,788
In other words, salvaging him means

118
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,792
reconstructing his body and
anchoring his psyche within it.

119
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,393
Is that possible?

120
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,928
With the Magi's support, yes.

121
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,297
Theoretically, right?

122
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,288
You can't know what will happen until you try it.

123
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:54,106
What is this?

124
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,397
Where am I?

125
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,776
In the entry plug?

126
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,478
In Unit 01?

127
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,758
But there's nobody here. I'm not even here.

128
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:05,951
What is this? What is this? What is this?

129
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,242
I don't really understand.

130
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,289
These people...

131
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:15,290
Yes, they're people I know,
people who know me.

132
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,532
I see. This is all part of my world.

133
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,366
What is this?

134
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:23,836
This is supposed to be my world,
but I don't really understand.

135
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,738
An image from outside?

136
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,106
An unpleasant image?

137
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:28,567
That's right! The enemy!

00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:29,092

It's all his fault!!

365
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:09,241
Shinji lkari
It's all his fault!!

366
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:09,341
It's all his fault!!

367
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:09,775
That time, I was actually going
to tell him I hate him!

368
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:10,008
Come.
Gendo lkari
That time, I was actually going
to tell him I hate him!

369
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,977
That time, I was actually going
to tell him I hate him!

370
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:12,211
Welcome to Nerv
That time, I was actually going
to tell him I hate him!

371
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:12,672
That time, I was actually going
to tell him I hate him!

372
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:19,952
Are you telling me to get on that thing
and put myself in danger, Father?

373
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:20,919
Correct.

374
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,490
What's with that?! I don't want to!
Why are you saying this now?!

375
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:27,259
I thought you didn't need me, Father!

376
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,160
I merely called you because I needed you.

377
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,232
Why me?

378
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,132
Because it's impossible for anyone else.

379
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,837
But that's impossible.

380
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,798
I've never even seen or heard of it.
There's no way I could do it!

381
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,711
No, I knew.

382
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:48,172
That's right! I knew the Eva.

383
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,783
And that time, I ran away!

384
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:52,834
Away from Mother and Father!

385
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,663
Current LCL temperature
holding steady at 36 degrees.

386
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,298
No problem with oxygen concentration.

387
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:09,501
Electromagnetic radiation pulse is normal.
Wave pattern is B.

388
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,612
All instrumentation is functioning normally.

389
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:12,771
Operation Plan
Type EP2 Salvage Work Procedural Outline
(and Type LP3 Complementation Procedure)

390
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,907
Operation Plan
Type EP2 Salvage Work Procedural Outline
(and Type LP3 Complementation Procedure)
Salvage Plan Outline...

391
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:15,407
Salvage Plan Outline...

392
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:19,011
Only you could have created
all this in just one month.

393
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,747
Unfortunately, I didn't come up with the idea.

394
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:24,183
It's data from experiments
completed ten years ago.

395
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,686
This kind of thing happened
during the Eva's development?

396
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,289
It was before I worked here.

397
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:34,126
It seems my mother was here,
but I only know the data.

398
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,795
And how did it come out back then?

399
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,196
I heard they failed.

400
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,726
Kindness...

401
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,372
Warmth...

402
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,393
Is this the warmth of a human?

403
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,132
I never knew it.

404
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,691
What is loneliness?

405
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:02,754
I didn't understand it before, but I think I do now.

406
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,523
What is happiness?

407
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:08,560
I didn't understand it before, but I think I do now.

408
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:12,331
Are others kind to you?

409
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:13,398
Yes.

410
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,866
Why?

411
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:18,136
Because I'm an Eva pilot.

412
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:21,073
Because I pilot Eva, they treat me well.

413
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,443
That's the reason why I'm allowed to be here.

414
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,745
It's all that sustains me.

415
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,481
So I have to pilot Eva.

416
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,816
Pilot, and?

417
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:35,120
Enemy! Yes, I have to fight what
everyone calls the enemy!

418
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,388
Fight, and?

419
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:37,789
I have to win!

420
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,158
Right, I mustn't lose.

421
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,694
I have to pilot the Eva as I'm told.

422
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,835
And  have to win as I'm told!

423
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,899
Otherwise...

424
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,234
Nobody...

425
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:50,869
Nobody...

426
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,160
Nobody...

427
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:55,641
Do your best.

428
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:56,642
Do your best.

429
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:59,044
What are you doing? Do it right.

430
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:00,212
Do your best, man.

431
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:01,546
Do your best.

432
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,297
Good work, Shiniji.

433
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,220
Miss Misato, Miss Ritsuko, Asuka, Toji, Kensuke,

434
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,988
and Father.

435
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,129
They all praise me.

436
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,393
When [ pilot Eva, they all praise me.

437
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:17,396
They praise someone like me,
and they all tell me to pilot it.

438
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:18,897
Father...

439
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,738
The father that abandoned me... I'll show him!

440
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,902
Do your best.

441
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,604
1'm doing my best.

442
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:26,895
I am doing my best!

443
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,009
Somebody be nice to me.

444
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:35,047
I've fought so hard! I'm fighting
with everything I've got!

445
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:36,848
Treat me well!

446
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,219
Be nice to me!

447
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,559
I am nice to you.

448
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,730
Tell me, Shinji, do you want
to become one with me?

449
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:54,366
To be of one mind and body?

450
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:57,502
It's a very, very comforting feeling.

451
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,583
It's okay, you know. I'm okay whenever you are.

452
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:04,543
Hey, stupid Shinji, don't you want
to become one with me?

453
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:07,479
To be of one mind and body?

454
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,216
Because it's a very, very comforting feeling.

455
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,937
You don't hear me say this every day.
Come over here already.

456
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,090
Ikari, do you want to become one with me?

457
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:20,759
To be of one mind and body?

458
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,829
It's a very, very comforting feeling.

459
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,760
Ikari?

460
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,998
Do you want to become one with me?

461
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,167
To be of one mind and body?

462
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,448
It's a very, very comforting feeling.

463
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:35,222
Come on, relax, and release your soul.

464
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,778
All investigative probes inserted.

465
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,389
Fixed at electromagnetic radius
of zero minus three.

466
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:46,351
Ego border pulse connection is complete.

467
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:48,720
Roger. Start salvage.

468
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,123
Roger, transmitting first signal.

469
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:53,825
Eva has received the signal.
No sign of rejection.

470
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:57,129
Proceeding to transmit second and third signals.

471
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,464
Subject cathexis is normal.

472
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,366
Destrudo cannot be confirmed.

473
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,646
Roger, shift the subject to stage two.

474
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:05,704

Hey, Shinijil

514
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:19,451
Toji
Yo, Shiniji.

515
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:19,484
Yo, Shiniji.

516
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:19,518
Kensuke
Yo, Shiniji.

517
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:19,951
Kensuke
Ikari...

518
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:19,985
Ikari...

519
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:20,352
Ayanami
Shinji!

520
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:20,452
Ayanami
Stupid Shinji!

521
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:20,485
Stupid Shinji!

522
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:20,685
Misato
Stupid Shinji!

523
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:20,719
Stupid Shinji!

524
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:20,786
Asuka
Stupid Shinji!

525
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:20,952
Asuka
Shinji!

526
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:20,986
Shinji!

527
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:21,186
Ritsuko
Shinji!

528
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:21,219
Ritsuko
Hey, Shinijil

529
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:21,486
Toji
Hey, Shinijil

530
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:21,620
Kensuke
Hey, Shinijil

531
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:21,720
Kensuke
Yo, Shiniji.

532
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:21,987
Ayanami
Yo, Shiniji.

533
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:22,020
Misato
Yo, Shiniji.

534
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:22,120
Misato
Ikari...

535
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:22,220
Asuka
Ikari...

536
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:22,354
Ritsuko
Ikari...

537
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:22,454
Toji
Ikari...

538
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:22,487
Toji

539
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:22,621
Kensuke

540
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:22,721
Ayanami

541
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:22,821
Misato

542
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:22,888
Asuka

543
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:22,988
Ritsuko

544
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:23,054
Toji

545
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:23,155
Kensuke

546
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:23,175
Ayanami

547
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,226
It's no good. The ego border is frozen in a loop.

548
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,127
Try firing all range of waveforms in all directions.

549
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:35,267
It's not working. The signals are being
trapped in Klein space.

550
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,768
What does that mean?

551
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,379
It means we failed.

552
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,640
Abort intervention. Reverse tangent plug.

553
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:43,308
Return the additive value to zero.

554
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:43,975
Yes, Ma'am.

555
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:44,309
Destrudo reaction in the old area. Pattern sepia.
Yes, Ma'am.

556
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,078
Destrudo reaction in the old area. Pattern sepia.

557
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:50,749
We've detected a change in the core pulse too!
Plus 0.3 is confirmed!

558
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,852
Maintenance of the status quo is top priority.
Prevent back flow.

559
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,320
Yes, Ma'am.

560
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:58,857
Plus 0.5... 0.8... This is odd. I can't stop it!

561
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:00,992
What is this? Why?

562
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,743
Don't you want to come back, Shinji?

563
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,170
I don't understand.

564
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,421
I don't understand.

565
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,714
L. ..

566
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,406
What do you wish?

567
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:16,007
What do you wish?

568
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,609
What do you wish?

569
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,980
What do you wish?

570
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,614
Eva has rejected the signal.

571
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:25,750
The self-formation of LCL is breaking down.

572
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,319
Pressure in the plug is increasing!

573
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,454
Abort all operations. Drop the power.

574
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,415
It's not working. The plug is venting!

575
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,197
Shinji!

576
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,303
Where am I?

577
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,805
Inside the Eva.

578
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:47,976
Inside the Eva?

579
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,910
Did I pilot the Eva again? Why?

580
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:53,430
You won't pilot the Eva anymore?

581
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:57,516
I've decided I will never pilot Eva again.

582
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,207
But you did pilot Evangelion Unit 01.

583
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:04,594
Shinji, you are here now
because you piloted the Eva.

584
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,245
You are the person you are now
because you piloted the Eva.

585
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:12,396
You cannot deny it, that you
in fact piloted the Eva,

586
00:17:12,397 --> 00:17:16,058
nor can you deny the self that you have
been so far, which is your past.

587
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,349
But as for what you will do from now on,

588
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:22,964
you must decide for yourself.

589
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,953
L. ..

590
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:33,442
If it can't... If it can't even save one life,
then what good is science?!

591
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,567
Give Shinji back! Give him back!

592
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:45,964
A smell...

593
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,254
A person's smell?

594
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,268
Miss Misato?

595
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:52,604
Ayanami?

596
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,035
No, not them.

597
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,408
That's right.

598
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,719
This is the smell of my mother.

599
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:04,545
So he will live in this world,
in the hell after the Second Impact?

600
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:09,358
Oh, but if you have the will to live,
anywhere can be heaven.

601
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,591
Because he is alive.

602
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,560
He'll have plenty of chances to find happiness.

603
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,640
I see. That's very true.

604
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,787
Mother...

605
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,134
Have you decided yet?

606
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:27,038
If it's a boy, Shiniji. If it's a girl,
I'll name her Rei.

607
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,029
Shiniji... Rei...

608
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,001
Mother...

609
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,286
Shinji!

610
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,065
Sure, I can understand, but I guess
that's what's called the oral stage.

611
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,233
The restoration of Unit 01 will be complete
the day after tomorrow.
Sure, I can understand, but I guess
that's what's called the oral stage.

612
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,669
The restoration of Unit 01 will be complete
the day after tomorrow.
It's something a psychologist
came up with a long time ago.

613
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:57,936
In the end, I guess humans will even use
God's powers as a tool.
It's something a psychologist

614
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:00,639
In the end, I guess humans will even use
God's powers as a tool.
In other words, it's where you want
to be with your mother forever.

615
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,375
In the end, I guess humans will even use
God's powers as a tool.
It refers to people who want to always
be dependent on someone.

616
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:03,575
In the end, I guess humans will even use
God's powers as a tool.
There's someone like that among my
acquaintences too, and you're a lot like him.

617
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:04,876
I don't know about that.
There's someone like that among my
acquaintences too, and you're a lot like him.

618
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,077
I hear some on the committee
have even suggested a freeze.
There's someone like that among my

619

So, well, as far as I can see from your letter,
from your girlfriend's standpoint,

620
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:07,912
So, well, as far as I can see from your letter,
from your girlfriend's standpoint,

621
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:08,780
The artificial human Evangelion...
So, well, as far as I can see from your letter,
from your girlfriend's standpoint,

622
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,115
The artificial human Evangelion...
being your lover, your mother,
and what else, your kid sister?

623
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:10,649
being your lover, your mother,
and what else, your kid sister?

624
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,483
For it being man-made, don't you think
the black box of unknowns is too large?
being your lover, your mother,
and what else, your kid sister?

625
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,219
For it being man-made, don't you think
the black box of unknowns is too large?
I think being all of these things
for you is pretty rough.

626
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:14,486
For it being man-made, don't you think
the black box of unknowns is too large?
And you know, aren't you sort of taking
advantage of her place as a lover,

627
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,421
And you know, aren't you sort of taking
advantage of her place as a lover,

628
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:16,554
Well, not that I care, since Shinji
was ultimately saved.
And you know, aren't you sort of taking
advantage of her place as a lover,

629
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:19,391
Well, not that I care, since Shinji
was ultimately saved.
using it as your personal outlet for your libido?

630
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:20,258
Well, not that I care, since Shinji
was ultimately saved.
Okay, well, that might have been a little extreme.

631
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:20,925
Okay, well, that might have been a little extreme.

632
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,227
That wasn't me. It was you, probably.
Okay, well, that might have been a little extreme.

633
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:25,063
That wasn't me. It was you, probably.
But a woman is very sensitive to whether
someone loves her or not.

634
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:25,230
That wasn't me. It was you, probably.
So I think she's probably
twigged onto that by now,

635
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:27,399
So I think she's probably
twigged onto that by now,

636
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:27,766
that you're looking for a mother
you can sleep with in her.

637
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,235
How about it? Want to go out
for a drink for once?
that you're looking for a mother
you can sleep with in her.

638
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:30,568
How about it? Want to go out
for a drink for once?
And if she still hasn't brought up
splitting up with you,

639
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,603
And if she still hasn't brought up
splitting up with you,

640
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,071
Sorry, I've got somewhere to go today.
And if she still hasn't brought up
splitting up with you,

641
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,305
Sorry, I've got somewhere to go today.
she might be one of those nice girls that
are pretty rare these days, you know?

642
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,040
she might be one of those nice girls that
are pretty rare these days, you know?

643
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:35,907
I see.
she might be one of those nice girls that
are pretty rare these days, you know?

644
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:36,428
I see.

645
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,366
See youl!

646
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,905
Going on a tryst with a man the moment
she knows that Shinji is safe?

647
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:49,584
I guess I'm in no position to talk.

648
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:55,606
Ritsuko must be thinking I'm pretty
disgusting right about now.

649
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,239
Indulging our carnal desires
is more realistic as humans.

650
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,100
We can fool them a little.

651
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,169
Our Intelligence Department?

652
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,280
Or Commander lkari and Ritsuko?

653
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,174
Or me?

654
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:11,109
No, myself.

655
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,840
You mean others, don't you?

656
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:18,979
You don't have any interest in others,
but you want their attention anyway.

657
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,628
You really are just like my father.

658
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,504
I didn't know you still smoked.

659
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,714
I only smoke after this sort of thing.

660
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,751
So nobody knows but you.

661
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,037
Well, I'm honored.

662
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:39,584
So, how far has the Human
Instrumentality Project gotten?

663
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,613
Adam, destroyer of humanity.

664
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,312
Why is it being kept underground?

665
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,229
Are you seeing me because
you want to know that?

666
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:53,047
Well, that's one of the reasons, to be honest.

667
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:57,822
I'm most honored to be used by a lady,

668
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,791
but I can't tell you in a place like this.

669
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:02,222
All I care about right now is for you
to understand what  want.

670
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,012
What is Nerv's and Commander lkari's
true objective?

671
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:09,813
I'd like to know that myself.

672
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:19,145
Hey, don't dodge my questions by doing that!

673
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,873
Hey, no!

674
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,454
Don't put strange things in there!

675
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:54,279
What are you doing at a time like this?
