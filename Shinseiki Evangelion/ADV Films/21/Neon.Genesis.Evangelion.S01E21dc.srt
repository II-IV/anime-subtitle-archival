You mean the super solenoid theory
that Dr. Katsuragi proposed?

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,941
That theory is just too radical!

4
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:11,722
It's nothing more than a hypothesis
at this point.

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:12,545
But only the S2 theory can explain
that giant's power.

leaving on the 11th.

We don't even need to measure it

Even though the untested breeze
taps at the door to your heart

You just look solely at me and smile

00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:21,269
So intent on seeking out that gentle touch

70

Such innocent eyes, still ignorant
of their destiny

that upon your back

He was last seen in District 8 on the west side.

87
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,784
That's within our compound!

88
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:41,053
What was your Intelligence Department doing?!

89
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,323
There’s an insider who leaked information
and instigated this.

90
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,358
He was able to get the better of us.

91
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,095
Someone who can pull the wool over
the eyes of Intelligence Division 2?

92
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,730
It can't bel

93
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:54,500
Ryoji Kaji is the man believed to be
the mastermind behind this.

94
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:57,168
And that's why you're here.

95
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,899
We appreciate your quick understanding.

96
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:01,406
As a member of the same organization,

97
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,310
it is regrettable that we must suspect
the Chief of Operations,

98
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,601
but this is part of our job.

99
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:08,547
Considering the history between me and him,

100
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,616
it seems like the logical step to take.

101
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,284
Thank you for your cooperation.

102
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,395
Take her away.

103
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,922
It has been a while, Chairman Kiel.

104
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,822
This is quite a rude welcome.

105
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,745
I need not apologize to you for the impropriety.

106
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:26,665
This is a necessary procedure in order
to speak with you at leisure.

107
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,467
You certainly haven't changed.

108
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:31,003
Does my convenience mean nothing then?

109
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,773
The problem being discussed
is an urgent matter.

110
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,407
It was unavoidable.

111
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,309
Please understand.

112
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,513
So, it's Seele and not the Committee.

113
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:43,849
We have no intention of creating a new god.

114
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,480
We would like your cooperation,

Oh, it's you two.

119
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,698
You wanna join us for some beer in Kamogawa?

120
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:00,900
Again?

121
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:04,470
Ryoko and the others are saying
they'll go if you go.

122
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,640
Our professor was also saying you should
show up once in a while.

123
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,101
Sure, all right.

124
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,445
It's good to go out and have
a drink every so often.

125
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,547
Yes, Sir.

126
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,182
You excel at your work,

127
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:19,652
but you don't take socializing seriously
and that's not good.

128
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,153
I'm sure you're right.

129
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,055
By the way, Fuyutsuki,

130
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:26,746
there's a bioengineering student
who submitted an interesting paper.

131
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,018
The student's name is lkari. Do you know her?

132
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,567
Ikari? No, I don't.

133
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,735
1 told her about you and she said
she was interested in meeting you.

134
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:40,339
She'll probably contact you eventually,
so take care of things, will you?

135
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,741
Ikari, was it? All right.

136
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,082
Metaphysical Biology Research Room 1 Fuyutsuki

137
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:46,846
I read your paper.

138
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,626
I found a couple of things questionable,
but it was a stimulating paper.

139
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:51,851
Thank you very much.

140
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,320
Yui Ikari, wasn't it?

141
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:55,421
Yes.

142
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,289
What are your plans for the future?

143
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,557
Are you going to find work?

144
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,527
Or do you intend to join the research lab here?

145
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,929
I haven't thought that far ahead yet.

146
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,540
And besides, aren't you forgetting a third option?

147
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,603
I'm also considering a domestic life.

148
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:12,683
Of course, that's only if I can find someone nice.

Back in the Year 2015

Evangelion Unit 01 has become

152
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,996
We have no use for an actualized god.

153
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:30,122
We must not create a god.

154
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,873
We cannot allow that man to create a god.

155
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,626
Gendo lkari, is he a man that can be trusted?

156
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,532
Gendo Rokubungi? I've heard of him.

going around about him.

No, I'll come.

165
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,479
When should I come over there?

166
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,339
I heard about you from a certain person,

167
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,162
so l wanted to meet you.

168
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:05,691
You're a rather coarse man,
to get into a drunken brawl.

169
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,827
There was no time to talk.
They just picked a fight with me.

170
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,963
I'm not very good at being liked,

171
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,864
but I am used to being treated coldly.

172
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,381
Well, it's none of my business anyway.

173
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,804
Professor Fuyutsuki,

174
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,795
you seem to be exactly the person
I expected you to be.

175
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,616
Yes, my first impression of him was of distaste.

176
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:31,477
And back then, seasons and autumn
still existed in this country.

177
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,686
Are you serious?

178
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:37,423
Yes, I am seeing Mr. Rokubungi.

179
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:40,584
When I heard that, I wasn't able
to hide my surprise.

180
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,397
I never would have thought you would
share your time with him.

181
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:49,268
Oh, but Professor Fuyutsuki,
he's quite a sweet person.

182
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,104
It's just that no one knows it.

183
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:55,240
Maybe it's more blissful not to know.

184
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:58,377
Did I inconvenience you by
introducing you to him?

185
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:02,388
No, I'll admit that he's an interesting man,
though I can't get to like him.

186
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:08,921
But within our circle, the common opinion
was that he had approached Yui

187
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:11,352
for her talent and for
the organization backing her.

188
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:16,895
Later,  would hear rumors that this
organization was called Seele.

189
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,156
Year 2000, Antarctica

190
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,666
The Second Impact.

191
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,569
That tragedy occurred in the final year
of the 20th century.

192
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,169
Year 2001

193
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,507
Year 2001
And the first year of the 21st century
was pure hell.

194
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,698
Year 2001
There is no other word to describe that year.

195
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:31,777
Year 2002

196
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,205
Ruins of Toyohashi City, Aichi Prefecture

197
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,754
I hear temperatures will rise above
30 degrees Celsius again today.

198
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,155
It certainly is hot over here.

199
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:45,496
That isn't even rare in Japan these days.

200
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,461
Summer has lasted for almost a year now.

201
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,296
It's rough on the body.

202
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,899
You don't want to move to that ship up there?

203
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,369
You mean the next town over?
That place constantly stinks of oil.

204
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,104
I just can't get to like it.

205
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:02,841
But still, I never imagined you'd
set up shop in such a place.

206
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,572
I had a lot of trouble finding you.

207
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:07,579
They're short on doctors here,
like everywhere else.

208
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,800
It's a mockery, but it's better than nothing.

209
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,820
Going to Antarctica at this late date?!

210
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,990
It is a formal investigation of the incident
commissioned by the UN Council.

211
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,511
It is a provisional organization,

212
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,761
but I would think you could be of
more use to the world there,

213
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,391
than working as an unlicensed doctor here,

214
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,200
Professor Fuyutsuki.

215
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,661
That's "former professor".

216
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,106
By the way, my column is blank.
Who recommended me?

217
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,567
Same Year, Antarctica

218
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,855
To think this was once a continent of ice...

219
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:43,582
There's no trace of it left.

220
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,923
Professor Fuyutsuki...

221
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,119
You?

222
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,410
I'm surprised you survived.

223
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:52,118
I'd heard that you were a member
of the Katsuragi Research Team.

224
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:55,928
Luckily, I had returned to Japan
the day before the incident,

225
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,896
so l was able to escape the tragedy.

226
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:58,947
I see.

227
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,899
Rokubungi, you...

228
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,040
Excuse me, I have a different name now.

229
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,706
A postcard? Not a business card?

230
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:08,937
We're Married
Gendo & Yui
Ikari
It has been a long time.
Are you doing well?

231
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,444
Ikari? Gendo IKari...

232
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,105
My wife has been nagging me to get
this to you, Professor Fuyutsuki.

233
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,983
She seems to be a fan of yours.

234
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,184
I'm honored.

235
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:19,985
Gendo & Yui
Ikari
It has been a long time.
Are you doing well?

236
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,587
Gendo & Yui
Ikari
It has been a long time.
Are you doing well?
How is Yui doing?

237
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:23,168
Gendo & Yui
Ikari
It has been a long time.
Are you doing well?
Isn't she participating in this expedition?

238
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:27,203
Yui wanted to come, but we
have a child now, so...

239
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:29,428
Safety First

240
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:32,498
Safety First
Your organization... Seele, was it?

241
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,399
Safety First
I've heard nothing but bad things about it.

242
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,180
Safety First
I can't approve of forcibly pinning down
the board of directors.

243
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,788
You're fastidious as ever.

244
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,609
No clean organization can survive
in this day and age anymore.

245
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,545
The official investigation of the Second Impact...

246
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:49,748
If the investigation team consisted
only of Seele people,

247
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,329
you would run into all sorts of issues later.

248
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,425
We're just a makeshift solution
to avoid that, aren't we?

249
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:57,743
Year 2015

250
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:59,884
Nerv Headquarters - Isolation Facility 4

251
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,961
I still don't handle dark places very well.

252
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,512
All the bad memories come flooding back.

253
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:06,932
Who is she?

254
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:09,434
She's the sole survivor of the original expedition.

255
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:10,255
Year 2002

256
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,638
South Pole Investigation Ship - Isolation Facility 2
Her name is Misato Katsuragi.

257
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,405
South Pole Investigation Ship - Isolation Facility 2
Katsuragi? She's Dr. Katsuragi's daughter?

258
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,075
Katsuragi? She's Dr. Katsuragi's daughter?

259
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:18,582
Yes, she hasn't spoken for
almost two years now.

260
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,579
That's terrible.

261
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,681
It attests to the hell that she witnessed.

262
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,349
Her physical injuries have healed,

263
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,810
but psychological wounds do not heal so easily.

264
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:28,921
I suppose so.

265
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:29,588
Safety First

266
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:31,759
Safety First
We can't conclude our findings for our
investigation lightly either.

267
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,961
A completely localized change to
the atmospheric elements.

268
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:38,922
The thorough extermination of all life,
including microorganisms.

269
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,315
The traces of an enormous cavern
directly below the blast center.

270
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,182
And this giant of light.

271
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,507
This incident is full of mysteries.

272
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:48,941
United Nations Moves Headquarters to Japan
In Five Years, Candidate is New Tokyo-2
Second Impact Caused by a Massive Meteor
Impossible to Predict or Avoid
Probability of Once in Every Several
Hundred Million Years
Official United Nations Statement
At 20-30% of the Speed of Light

273
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:51,410
United Nations Moves Headquarters to Japan
In Five Years, Candidate is New Tokyo-2
Second Impact Caused by a Massive Meteor
Impossible to Predict or Avoid
Probability of Once in Every Several
Hundred Million Years
Official United Nations Statement
At 20-30% of the Speed of Light
Soon after, the United Nations issued
an official statement

274
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,840
United Nations Moves Headquarters to Japan
In Five Years, Candidate is New Tokyo-2
Second Impact Caused by a Massive Meteor
Impossible to Predict or Avoid
Probability of Once in Every Several
Hundred Million Years
Official United Nations Statement
At 20-30% of the Speed of Light
stating that the Second Impact was
caused by a massive meteor.

275
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,792
But from where I stood, I could see

276
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,991
that the information had been
blatantly massaged.

277
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:05,928
Behind all this was Seele and hints that
a man named Kiel was involved.

278
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,079
And it made me want to learn the
dark truth of that incident.

279
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:11,363
Year 2003, Hakone

280
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,531
Year 2003, Hakone
Even if that might eventually lead me
to the name of Yui Ikari.

281
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,372
United Nations Artificial Evolution Laboratory
Even if that might eventually lead me
to the name of Yui Ikari.

282
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,343
It has been a long time.

283
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:25,834
Yes, it has.

284
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,061
Director's Office

285
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,006
Why do you hide the existence
of the giant of light?!

286
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,895
You guys knew about the
Second Impact, didn't you?

287
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,626
That it would happen on that day?

288
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,660
You said you were lucky enough
to get out the day before.

289
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,804
Was it also luck that you took
all your research with you?!

290
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,470
I am surprised that this material
escaped destruction.

291
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,810
I did a thorough investigation of your assets.

292
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,452
I'm sure raising a child is expensive,

293
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,762
but isn't the amount rather large
for you to have privately?

294
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,524
You impress me, Professor Fuyutsuki.

295
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,093
Why not transfer to the department
of economics?

296
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:18,430
1'm going to go public about Seele
and the Dead Sea Scrolls

297
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,361
being secretly behind the Second Impact.

298
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,769
I have no intention of letting the people
who caused that get away with it!

299
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,070
Feel free.

300
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,621
But before you do, there is something
I would like to show you.

301
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,577
We're going down quite a ways.

302
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,112
Does it worry you?

303
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:34,903
Somewhat.

304
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,517
What is this?

305
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:41,753
A cavern left behind by someone,
who was not us.

306
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,864
Though eighty-nine percent of it is buried.

307
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,247
An underground cavern that was originally
a neat spherical shape...

308
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,364
Is this the same as the underground
cavern found at the South Pole?!

309
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,415
The data from them are virtually identical.

310
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:58,578
Do you intend to repeat
that tragedy once again?!

311
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,941
Is that what you're doing?!

312
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:05,602
Whether we are or not, please
determine that for yourself.

313
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,119
All the resources mankind has to offer
are being poured into that facility.

314
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,396
Oh, Professor Fuyutsuki.

315
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,660
Akagi, you too?

316
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:24,796
Yes, this is the best place to research

317
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,317
the fundamental theories for the
bio-computers of the future.

318
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,134
I see.

319
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:31,002
I intend to name it Magi.

320
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,613
Magi? After the three wise men from the East?

321
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:35,874
Is this what you wanted to show me?

322
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,244
No, this way, please.

323
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,855
Ritsuko, I'll be right back.

324
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,218
What is this?

325
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,786
Is this that giant?!

326
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:51,156
Here at Gehirn, we call that giant Adam.

327
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:52,691
But this is not it.

328
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,332
It is not the original.

329
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:56,795
Then...

330
00:14:56,796 --> 00:15:00,966
Yes, it is an Eva, made from Adam by man.

331
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,234
An Eva?!

332
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,603
This is the Adam Revival Project,

333
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,972
generally known as Project E,
and this is our mockup,

334
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,402
Eva Unit 00.

335
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,976
A prototype for a god?!

336
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:12,310
Fuyutsuki,

337
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:15,561
work with me to create a new era
in the history of mankind.

338
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:22,310
Year 2015

339
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:25,690
Excuse me, Ma'am?

340
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:29,227
Oh, I'm sorry. Let's hurry up and retest Rei.

341
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,218
I haven't seen Miss Katsuragi around today.

342
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,081
You're right.

343
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,333
Miss Katsuragi?

344
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,669
Right! Misato Katsuragi! Nice to meet you!

345
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,171

New Tokyo-2, Nagano Prefecture

00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:39,638
Year 2005
New Tokyo-2, Nagano Prefecture
Mother,

347
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:39,704
Mother,

348
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:40,505
2nd Tokyo University, School Grounds
Mother,

349
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,756
2nd Tokyo University, School Grounds
I met a girl named Katsuragi the other day.

350
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:46,144
Other people will only look at me from afar,

351
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,648
and each time, I am reminded of
the weight your name carries,

352
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,749
but this girl has no reservation
towards me for some reason.

353
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:57,514
I am told that she is the sole survivor
of that expedition.

354
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,492
She was apparently aphasic for a time,

355
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:03,923
but now, she chatters away a mile a minute
as if to make up for lost time.

356
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,775
Ritchan, I am still burrowed underground,
the same as always.

357
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,304
I've grown tired of the lunches they provide.

358
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,474
On the surface, they have apparently begun
working on the plans for New Tokyo-3

359
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,205
in accordance with the Second
Capital Transfer Project.

360
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,946
Lately, Misato hadn't been showing up
at the university,

361
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:23,257
and when I finally got her to tell me why,
it was so idiotic.

362
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,086
Apparently, she had been sleeping with
her boyfriend at her apartment,

363
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,817
for an entire week!

364
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,563
I feel like I have seen an unexpected side of her.

365
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,627
She introduced him to me today.

366
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:37,062
He's good-looking,

367
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:39,433
but I just cannot get to like his frivolous attitude.

368
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:44,436
As I recall, you have never been
good around boys, Ritchan.

369
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,872
In the end, being raised only by a woman...

370
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:50,442
No, I'm sorry. I have left you to your
own devices for so long.

371
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:53,372
It's awful of me to act like a mother
only when it's convenient.

372
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:56,915
A mother...

373
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:57,736
Year 2003

374
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:58,737
Ashinoko Lakefront, Hakone

375
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:02,487
Today is just like every other day.

376
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:05,328
The disappearance of autumn
from this country is truly sad.

377
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,493
The secret Dead Sea Scrolls
that Seele possesses...

378
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:11,296
If things happen as it is written in those scrolls,

379
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:14,299
the Third Impact will happen in
another decade or so without fail.

380
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,700
The organizations are meant
to prevent the final tragedy.

381
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,504
That is what Seele and Gehirn are.

382
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,905
I support your ideas, not Seele's.

383
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:29,076
Professor Fuyutsuki, it will be very dangerous
to unleash that seal upon the world.

384
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,517
I have already handed the data over to lkari.

385
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,628
It's not something that can be accomplished
by an individual after all.

386
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,003
There won't be a repeat performance
of the stunt I pulled earlier.

387
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,765
And I've sort of received a warning.

388
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:50,168
Getting rid of me couldn't be easier
for them, it seems.

389
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,470
The same goes for all the survivors.

390
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,073
It's a simple thing to destroy people.

391
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,794
But that's no reason for you to become
an experimental subject.

392
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,061
I will go along with the flow of things.

393
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,674
After all, that is why I am at Seele.

394
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,085
For Shinji.

395
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,153
Year 2004

396
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,507
Hakone - Underground Laboratory 2

397
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,637
LCL electrified. Pressure at plus zero point two.

398
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,706
No destrudo readings detected in transmissions.

399
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:27,906
Para-base is stable.

400
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,341
Para-base is stable.
What is this child doing here?

401
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:30,008
What is this child doing here?

402
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:32,310
He's Director lkari's son.

403
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,591
Ikari, this is not a nursery school.
Today is a crucial day!

404
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,406
I'm sorry, Professor Fuyutsuki.
I'm the one who brought him.

405
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:43,421
Yui, this is your experiment today.

406
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:44,856
That's why.

407
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,317
I want to show my child the bright future.

408
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,329
Those were Ms. Yui's final words.

409
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,580
The irregular circumstances erased her
from this world.

410
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:58,142
Exactly as I had wished.

411
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,258
I am such a horrible woman.

412
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,271
Ritchan, Director lkari changed after that day.

413
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,349
Where have you been for the past week?

414
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:11,883
You're allowed to grieve, but you
need to be aware

415
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,552
that you are responsible for
more than yourself now.

416
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,021
I know.

417
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:19,302
Fuyutsuki, I am going to recommend
a new project starting today.

418
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,694
I have already proposed it to Chairman Kiel.

419
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,496
You're not going to...

420
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,630
That's right.

421
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,767
The path to godhood that none have
ever succeeded in before.

422
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,802
The Human Instrumentality Project.

423
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:31,593
Year 2008

424
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:33,872
Mother,

425
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:36,474
congratulations on the completion of
the fundamental theory of Magi.

426
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,643
This is not exactly a gift to celebrate it with,

427
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:42,147
but my formal admission into Gehirn
has been unofficially approved.

428
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:44,578
I will be working on Project E
starting next month.

429
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:51,492
Who's there?

430
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,494
Technology Development Department,
Ritsuko Akagi.

431
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:57,695
Here's my ID.

432
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,131
I heard the command center
had been completed,

433
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,472
so  came to see it, but this place is a maze.

434
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:06,522
If you want the command center,
the Director and Dr. Akagi are there.

435
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,109
Are you really sure?

436
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,179
Yes, I have no regrets concerning my work.

437
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,870
Liar! You just can't forget about Ms. Yui, right?

438
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,981
But I don't mind.

439
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:31,052
Year 2010

440
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:32,437
Geofront Artificial Canopy

441
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,398
Lower Level 2 Direct Support Area
(Future Location)

442
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,549
That's the headquarters for Gehirn.

443
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,059
Good morning, Director.

444
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,542
Did you bring your child today?

445
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:47,412
Oh, but you have a son, if I'm not mistaken.

446
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,013
This isn't Shinji.

447
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,944
I'm taking care of a friend's daughter.

448
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,685
Her name is Rei Ayanami.

449
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:55,265
Hello, Rei.

450
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:58,926
This girl reminds me of someone...

451
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,132
Ms. Yui?

452
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,471
All files concerning Rei Ayanami
have been erased already?

453
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,032
It's blank.

454
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:08,867
What does this mean?

455
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:10,768
Completed

456
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:15,067
Magi Casper, Magi Balthasar,
and Magi Melchior.

457
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,476
The Magi are the three parts
that make up who I am.

458
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:22,927
The scientist in me, the mother in me,
and the woman in me.

459
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,651
And those three elements will be in
constant conflict with one another.

460
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,052
The three parts of you...

461
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,014
The only thing left is to power it up, right?

462
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:35,193
1'm going to go home early today.

463
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:36,628
Misato's coming back.

464
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,931
That's right, I didn't know she
was a member of Gehirn.

465
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,332
I believe she's in Germany?

466
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,568
Yes, she's serving in Branch 3.

467
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,937
Then I suppose it's a long-distance relationship.

468
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:47,338
I heard they broke up.

469
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,575
Oh, and they looked so good together too.

470
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:52,577
You can never tell with a man and a woman,

471
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:54,212
because it's not logical.

472
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:56,463
That cool attitude of yours
certainly hasn't changed.

473
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:59,652
You're going to let your own
happiness slip away.

474
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,990
Happiness is even harder to define.

475
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:06,958
Well, it's been a long time since
I've gone drinking.

476
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,193
Goodnight.

477
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:09,334
Goodnight.

478
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,943
Did you want something, Rei?

479
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:26,578
I got lost.

480
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:29,889
Oh, really? Then you want to
leave here with me?

481
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:32,550
That's okay.

482
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,919
But you won't be able to get home
by yourself, right?

483
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,030
That's none of your business, you old hag.

484
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:39,757
What?

485
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:42,248
I can go home by myself,
so leave me alone, you old hag.

486
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:46,364
It's not nice to call someone an old hag.

487
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,566
But you are an old hag, aren't you?

488
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:52,237
I'm going to get mad. You need
a good scolding from Director lkari.

489
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:55,073
That's what the Director calls you.

490
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:55,907
That...

491
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:57,508
He says, “That old hag is pushy,”

492
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,619
or that he, “doesn't need that old hag anymore.”

493
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,713
He says, “That old hag is pushy,”

494
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,734
or that he, “doesn't need that old hag anymore.”

495
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,120
He doesn't need that old hag anymore.

496
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:10,847
It's what the Director calls you.

497
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,297
You're nothing but a...

498
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:21,866
It doesn't matter if you die,
you can always be replaced.

499
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:22,947
Rei...

00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,196
The same as me.

501
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:37,882
The Human Instrumentality Project Committee,
chaired by Kiel Lorenz,

502
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:41,019
dissolved the research organization,
Gehirn, the next day.

503
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,187
And they formed the special duty
organization, Nerv,

504
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:45,623
as the organization that would
carry out all projects.

505
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:49,560
All of us were moved directly into Nerv,

506
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:54,011
with the exception of one, Dr. Akagi,
the remarkable creator of the Magi System.

507
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:55,593
Year 2015

508
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:59,119
Now, I guess I'll go.

509
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:05,843
Oh, it's you.

510
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,304
Long time no see.

511
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,848
I've put the guards outside to sleep for a while.

512
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:13,158
This will cost you your life.

513
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:16,821
I just want to get closer to the truth

514
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,456
within myself.

515
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,591
Besides, it looks like they'll find out

516
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:23,094
that I diverted the sample of
Adam to Commander Ikari,

517
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:25,263
so I have to guard my own interests too,

518
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:27,373
or various bad things will happen.

519
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,637
Thank you very much for your cooperation.

520
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:36,641
Is it over?

521
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,982
Yes, the problem has been resolved, so...

522
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,730
I see.

523
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:44,849
What about him?

524
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,990
I do not know.

525
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:01,198
Hey, you're late.

526
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:14,435
I'm home.

Katsuragi, it's me.

530
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,057
I've probably put you through a lot of trouble

531
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,198
by the time you're listening to this.

532
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,628
I'm sorry.

533
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:05,738
Tell Ritchan I said I'm sorry too.

534
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,800
Also, since I've troubled you so much anyway,

535
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:11,235
there's this flower I've been growing...

536
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,426
I1t'd make me happy if you'd water it for me.

537
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,406
Shinji knows where it is.

538
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:20,669
Katsuragi, the truth is with you.

539
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,260
Go forward without any hesitation.

540
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:27,070
If I ever get to see you again,

541
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,030
I'll say the words I wasn't able
to say eight years ago.

542
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,690
Bye.

543
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,001
Message recorded at 12:02pm.

544
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:39,703
Jerk...

545
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,513
You're really such a jerk...

546
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,998
Right then, all I could do was
run away from Misato.

547
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:15,107
There was nothing I could do or say.
I was a child.

548
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,669
It made me realize that.

549
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,280
To Be Continued

Preview

551
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:57,468
The reality of having lost to Shinji corners
Asuka into a psychological pitfall.

552
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:01,472
The futility of panicking only produced
weariness and impatience.

553
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,841
Furthermore, the psychological attack
from an Angel

554
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,043
delivers the finishing blow to Asuka's mind.

555
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:08,045
Asuka loses the means to recover.

556
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:11,749
The harsh reality tears apart people's hearts.

557
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,710
Shinji is unable to offer her
any words of comfort.

558
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,657
Next time, "At Least, Be Human"

559
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,832
Next Time
At Least, Be Human
