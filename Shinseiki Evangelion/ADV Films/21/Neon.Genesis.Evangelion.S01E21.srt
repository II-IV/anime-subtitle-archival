1
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:06,401
Just like the cruel angel

2
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:14,081
Young boy, become a legend

3
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,190
Even though the untested breeze
taps at the door to your heart

4
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:36,490
You just look solely at me and smile

5
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:42,971
So intent on seeking out that gentle touch

6
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:50,982
Such innocent eyes, still ignorant
of their destiny

7
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:57,989
But someday, you are sure to realize
that upon your back

8
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:05,907
You have the wings with which to fly
towards the distant future

9
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:11,103
The cruel angel's thesis

10
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:14,839
Soon, you will take flight from the windowsill

11
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:18,610
With your torrent of ardent pathos

12
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:22,315
If you are to betray our memories

13
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:25,952
You, who embrace these heavens and shine

14
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:29,233
Young boy, become a legend

15
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,460
Hello, I'm not home right now.

16
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,711
Please leave your message after the beep.

17
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,814
My last job...

18
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:45,756
The red is as if it's for the color of blood.

19
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:48,622
Nerv Is Born
Episode Twenty-One

20
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:51,643
Abducted?! The Vice Commander?

21
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,713
It happened two hours ago.

22
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:56,881
He was last seen in District 8 on the west side.

23
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,783
That's within our compound!

24
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,053
What was your Intelligence Department doing?!

25
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:04,323
There’s an insider who leaked information
and instigated this.

26
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,359
He was able to get the better of us.

27
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,095
Someone who can pull the wool over
the eyes of Intelligence Division 2?

28
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,729
It can't bel

29
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:14,500
Ryoji Kaji is the man believed to be
the mastermind behind this.

30
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:17,168
And that's why you're here.

31
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,899
We appreciate your quick understanding.

32
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:21,406
As a member of the same organization,

33
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:24,310
it is regrettable that we must suspect
the Chief of Operations,

34
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,601
but this is part of our job.

35
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,547
Considering the history between me and him,

36
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,616
it seems like the logical step to take.

37
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,284
Thank you for your cooperation.

38
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,395
Take her away.

39
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:36,922
It has been a while, Chairman Kiel.

40
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,823
This is quite a rude welcome.

41
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,746
I need not apologize to you for the impropriety.

42
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:46,666
This is a necessary procedure in order
to speak with you at leisure.

43
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,466
You certainly haven't changed.

44
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,003
Does my convenience mean nothing then?

45
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,773
The problem being discussed
is an urgent matter.

46
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,408
It was unavoidable.

47
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,309
Please understand.

48
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,513
So, it's Seele and not the Committee.

49
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,849
We have no intention of creating a new god.

50
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,480
We would like your cooperation,
Professor Fuyutsuki.

51
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:09,841
Professor Fuyutsuki...

52
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:11,757
Professor! Professor Fuyutsuki!

53
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,018
Year 1999, Kyoto
Professor! Professor Fuyutsuki!

54
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,962
Oh, it's you two.

55
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,698
You wanna join us for some beer in Kamogawa?

56
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,900
Again?

57
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:24,470
Ryoko and the others are saying
they'll go if you go.

58
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:27,640
Our professor was also saying you should
show up once in a while.

59
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,101
Sure, all right.

60
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,446
It's good to go out and have
a drink every so often.

61
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:34,547
Yes, Sir.

62
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,182
You excel at your work,

63
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:39,652
but you don't take socializing seriously
and that's not good.

64
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,153
I'm sure you're right.

65
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,055
By the way, Fuyutsuki,

66
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,746
there's a bioengineering student
who submitted an interesting paper.

67
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:50,018
The student's name is lkari. Do you know her?

68
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,566
Ikari? No, I don't.

69
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,736
1 told her about you and she said
she was interested in meeting you.

70
00:03:56,737 --> 00:04:00,339
She'll probably contact you eventually,
so take care of things, will you?

71
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,708
Ikari, was it? All right.

72
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,049
Metaphysical Biology Research Room 1 Fuyutsuki

73
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:06,846
I read your paper.

74
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,627
I found a couple of things questionable,
but it was a stimulating paper.

75
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,851
Thank you very much.

76
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,320
Yui Ikari, wasn't it?

77
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,421
Yes.

78
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,289
What are your plans for the future?

79
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,557
Are you going to find work?

80
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:21,527
Or do you intend to join the research lab here?

81
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,929
I haven't thought that far ahead yet.

82
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,540
And besides, aren't you forgetting a third option?

83
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,603
I'm also considering a domestic life.

84
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,683
Of course, that's only if I can find someone nice.

85
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:34,516
Back in the Year 2015

86
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,943
With an S2 engine on board,

87
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,134
Evangelion Unit 01 has become
an absolute being!

88
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,829
We have no use for an actualized god.

89
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,953
We must not create a god.

90
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,704
We cannot allow that man to create a god.

91
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:54,457
Gendo lkari, is he a man that can be trusted?

92
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,999
Gendo Rokubungi? I've heard of him.

93
00:04:58,498 --> 00:04:59,231
Back in the Year 1999

94
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,982
Back in the Year 1999
No, I've never met him,

95
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:03,102
but there's always some rumor
going around about him.

96
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,703
Kyoto Prefecture Police Department
but there's always some rumor
going around about him.

97
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:05,171
Kyoto Prefecture Police Department

98
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,206
Kyoto Prefecture Police Department
What? He asked to be released
into my custody?

99
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:08,167
What? He asked to be released
into my custody?

100
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,609
No, I'll come.

101
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,310
When should I come over there?

102
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,170
I heard about you from a certain person,

103
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,994
so l wanted to meet you.

104
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,522
You're a rather coarse man,
to get into a drunken brawl.

105
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,659
There was no time to talk.
They just picked a fight with me.

106
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,794
I'm not very good at being liked,

107
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,695
but I am used to being treated coldly.

108
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,212
Well, it's none of my business anyway.

109
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,635
Professor Fuyutsuki,

110
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:39,626
you seem to be exactly the person
I expected you to be.

111
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,437
Yes, my first impression of him was of distaste.

112
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:49,302
And back then, seasons and autumn
still existed in this country.

113
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,517
Are you serious?

114
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:55,254
Yes, I am seeing Mr. Rokubungi.

115
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:58,415
When I heard that, I wasn't able
to hide my surprise.

116
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,229
I never would have thought you would
share your time with him.

117
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:07,100
Oh, but Professor Fuyutsuki,
he's quite a sweet person.

118
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,935
It's just that no one knows it.

119
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:13,072
Maybe it's more blissful not to know.

120
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:16,208
Did I inconvenience you by
introducing you to him?

121
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:20,219
No, I'll admit that he's an interesting man,
though I can't get to like him.

122
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:26,752
But within our circle, the common opinion
was that he had approached Yui

123
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,183
for her talent and for
the organization backing her.

124
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:34,136
Later,  would hear rumors that this
organization was called Seele.

125
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,087
Year 2000, Antarctica

126
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,497
The Second Impact.

127
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,018
That tragedy occurred in the final year
of the 20th century.

128
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:42,001
Year 2001

129
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:46,338
Year 2001
And the first year of the 21st century
was pure hell.

130
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,619
Year 2001
There is no other word to describe that year.

131
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:49,739
Year 2002

132
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:55,056
To think this was once a continent of ice...

133
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,783
There's no trace of it left.

134
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,123
Professor Fuyutsuki...

135
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,253
You?

136
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,594
I'm surprised you survived.

137
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,296
I'd heard that you were a member
of the Katsuragi Research Team.

138
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:10,129
Luckily, I had returned to Japan
the day before the incident,

139
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,064
so l was able to escape the tragedy.

140
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,145
I see.

141
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,100
Rokubungi, you...

142
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,241
Excuse me, I have a different name now.

143
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,674
A postcard? Not a business card?

144
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:22,875
We're Married
Gendo & Yui
Ikari
It has been a long time.
Are you doing well?

145
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,578
Ikari? Gendo IKari...

146
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,299
My wife has been nagging me to get
this to you, Professor Fuyutsuki.

147
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,117
She seems to be a fan of yours.

148
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,218
I'm honored.

149
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,119
Gendo & Yui
Ikari
It has been a long time.
Are you doing well?

150
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,721
Gendo & Yui
Ikari
It has been a long time.
Are you doing well?
How is Yui doing?

151
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,241
Gendo & Yui
Ikari
It has been a long time.
Are you doing well?
Isn't she participating in this expedition?

152
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,404
Yui wanted to come, but we
have a child now, so...

153
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:43,629
Safety First

154
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,699
Safety First
Your organization... Seele, was it?

155
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,600
Safety First
I've heard nothing but bad things about it.

156
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,261
Safety First
I can't approve of forcibly pinning down
the board of directors.

157
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,506
You're fastidious as ever.

158
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:57,810
No clean organization can survive
in this day and age anymore.

159
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,746
The official investigation of the Second Impact...

160
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:03,949
If the investigation team consisted
only of Seele people,

161
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,530
you would run into all sorts of issues later.

162
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,626
We're just a makeshift solution
to avoid that, aren't we?

163
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:11,814
Year 2015

164
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,955
Nerv Headquarters - Isolation Facility 4

165
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,062
I still don't handle dark places very well.

166
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,613
All the bad memories come flooding back.

167
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,033
Who is she?

168
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,535
She's the sole survivor of the original expedition.

169
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:24,326
Year 2002

170
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,739
South Pole Investigation Ship - Isolation Facility 2
Her name is Misato Katsuragi.

171
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,473
South Pole Investigation Ship - Isolation Facility 2
Katsuragi? She's Dr. Katsuragi's daughter?

172
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:29,174
Katsuragi? She's Dr. Katsuragi's daughter?

173
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,683
Yes, she hasn't spoken for
almost two years now.

174
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,680
That's terrible.

175
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,782
It attests to the hell that she witnessed.

176
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,450
Her physical injuries have healed,

177
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,911
but psychological wounds do not heal so easily.

178
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:42,955
I suppose so.

179
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:43,689
Safety First

180
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,830
Safety First
We can't conclude our findings for our
investigation lightly either.

181
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,495
This giant of light...
This incident is full of mysteries.

182
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:49,995
United Nations Moves Headquarters to Japan
In Five Years, Candidate is New Tokyo-2
Second Impact Caused by a Massive Meteor
Impossible to Predict or Avoid
Probability of Once in Every Several
Hundred Million Years
Official United Nations Statement
At 20-30% of the Speed of Light

183
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,398
United Nations Moves Headquarters to Japan
In Five Years, Candidate is New Tokyo-2
Second Impact Caused by a Massive Meteor
Impossible to Predict or Avoid
Probability of Once in Every Several
Hundred Million Years
Official United Nations Statement
At 20-30% of the Speed of Light
Soon after, the United Nations issued
an official statement

184
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,829
United Nations Moves Headquarters to Japan
In Five Years, Candidate is New Tokyo-2
Second Impact Caused by a Massive Meteor
Impossible to Predict or Avoid
Probability of Once in Every Several
Hundred Million Years
Official United Nations Statement
At 20-30% of the Speed of Light
stating that the Second Impact was
caused by a massive meteor.

185
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,779
But from where I stood, I could see

186
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,979
that the information had been
blatantly massaged.

187
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,915
Behind all this was Seele and hints that
a man named Kiel was involved.

188
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,068
And it made me want to learn the
dark truth of that incident.

Even if that might eventually lead me
to the name of Yui Ikari.

191
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,621

Even if that might eventually lead me
to the name of Yui Ikari.

Director's Office

193
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,907
Why do you hide the existence
of the giant of light?!

194
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:24,797
You guys knew about the
Second Impact, didn't you?

195
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:25,364
That it would happen on that day?

196
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:26,765
Laboratory Director Gendo lkari
That it would happen on that day?

197
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:27,616
Laboratory Director Gendo lkari

198
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:31,555
You said you were lucky enough
to get out the day before.

199
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:35,706
Was it also luck that you took
all your research with you?!

200
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,371
I am surprised that this material
escaped destruction.

201
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:44,712
I did a thorough investigation of your assets.

202
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,353
I'm sure raising a child is expensive,

203
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,664
but isn't the amount rather large
for you to have privately?

204
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,425
You impress me, Professor Fuyutsuki.

205
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,994
Why not transfer to the department
of economics?

206
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:59,331
1'm going to go public about Seele
and the Dead Sea Scrolls

207
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,262
being secretly behind the Second Impact.

208
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,670
I have no intention of letting the people
who caused that get away with it!

209
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,971
Feel free.

210
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,521
But before you do, there is something
I would like to show you.

211
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,479
We're going down quite a ways.

212
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,013
Does it worry you?

213
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:15,804
Somewhat.

214
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:19,418
What is this?

215
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:22,654
A cavern left behind by someone,
who was not us.

216
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,765
Though eighty-nine percent of it is buried.

217
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:28,148
An underground cavern that was originally
a neat spherical shape...

218
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:32,569
All the resources mankind has to offer
are being poured into that facility.

219
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,279
Oh, Professor Fuyutsuki.

220
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,443
Akagi, you too?

221
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:47,679
Yes, this is the best place to research

222
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,199
the fundamental theories for the
bio-computers of the future.

223
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,017
I see.

224
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,119
I intend to name it Magi.

225
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,780
Magi? After the three wise men from the East?

226
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:58,964
Is this what you wanted to show me?

227
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,394
No, this way, please.

228
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,005
Ritsuko, I'll be right back.

229
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,967
What is this?

230
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,536
Is this that giant?!

231
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:13,906
Here at Gehirn, we call that giant Adam.

232
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,440
But this is not it.

233
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,081
It is not the original.

234
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:19,545
Then...

235
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:23,715
Yes, it is an Eva, made from Adam by man.

236
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:24,983
An Eva?!

237
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,352
This is the Adam Revival Project,

238
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,721
generally known as Project E,
and this is our mockup,

239
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,151
Eva Unit 00.

240
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,725
A prototype for a god?!

241
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,060
Fuyutsuki,

242
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:38,311
work with me to create a new era
in the history of mankind.

243
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:45,424
Year 2015

244
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,607
Excuse me, Ma'am?

245
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:52,311
Oh, I'm sorry. Let's hurry up and retest Rei.

246
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,302
I haven't seen Miss Katsuragi around today.

247
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:56,165
You're right.

248
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,417
Miss Katsuragi?

249
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,752
Right! Misato Katsuragi! Nice to meet you!

Mother,

252
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:02,788

Mother,

254
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,840
2nd Tokyo University, School Grounds
I met a girl named Katsuragi the other day.

255
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,228
Other people will only look at me from afar,

256
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,731
and each time, I am reminded of
the weight your name carries,

257
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,832
but this girl has no reservation
towards me for some reason.

258
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:20,597
I am told that she is the sole survivor
of that expedition.

259
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,575
She was apparently aphasic for a time,

260
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:27,006
but now, she chatters away a mile a minute
as if to make up for lost time.

261
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:31,858
Ritchan, I am still burrowed underground,
the same as always.

262
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,387
I've grown tired of the lunches they provide.

263
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:38,557
On the surface, they have apparently begun
working on the plans for New Tokyo-3

264
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,288
in accordance with the Second
Capital Transfer Project.

265
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,029
Lately, Misato hadn't been showing up
at the university,

266
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,339
and when I finally got her to tell me why,
it was so idiotic.

267
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:51,169
Apparently, she had been sleeping with
her boyfriend at her apartment,

268
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,900
for an entire week!

269
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,646
I feel like I have seen an unexpected side of her.

270
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:58,710
She introduced him to me today.

271
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,145
He's good-looking,

272
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,516
but I just cannot get to like his frivolous attitude.

273
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,519
As I recall, you have never been
good around boys, Ritchan.

274
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,955
In the end, being raised only by a woman...

275
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,525
No, I'm sorry. I have left you to your
own devices for so long.

276
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,455
It's awful of me to act like a mother
only when it's convenient.

277
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:19,898
A mother...

278
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:20,719

282
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:27,472
Para-base is stable.

283
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,907
Para-base is stable.
What is this child doing here?

284
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:29,574
What is this child doing here?

285
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,877
He's Director lkari's son.

286
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:35,158
Ikari, this is not a nursery school.
Today is a crucial day!

287
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,972
I'm sorry, Professor Fuyutsuki.
I'm the one who brought him.

288
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,988
Yui, this is your experiment today.

289
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,423
That's why.

290
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,884
I want to show my child the bright future.

291
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,896
Those were Ms. Yui's final words.

292
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:54,147
The irregular circumstances erased her
from this world.

293
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,708
Exactly as I had wished.

294
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:00,824
I am such a horrible woman.

295
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:04,838
Ritchan, Director lkari changed after that day.

296
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,915
Where have you been for the past week?

297
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,450
You're allowed to grieve, but you
need to be aware

298
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:14,119
that you are responsible for
more than yourself now.

299
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,587
I know.

300
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:18,867
Fuyutsuki, I am going to recommend
a new project starting today.

301
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,260
I have already proposed it to Chairman Kiel.

302
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,062
You're not going to...

303
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,197
That's right.

304
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,333
The path to godhood that none have
ever succeeded in before.

305
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,084
The Human Instrumentality Project.

Year 2008

307
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:33,438
Mother,

308
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,041
congratulations on the completion of
the fundamental theory of Magi.

309
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,210
This is not exactly a gift to celebrate it with,

310
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,713
but my formal admission into Gehirn
has been unofficially approved.

311
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,144
I will be working on Project E
starting next month.

312
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,059
Who's there?

313
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,061
Technology Development Department,
Ritsuko Akagi.

314
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,262
Here's my ID.

315
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,698
I heard the command center
had been completed,

316
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,039
so  came to see it, but this place is a maze.

317
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:06,089
If you want the command center,
the Director and Dr. Akagi are there.

318
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,675
Are you really sure?

319
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,745
Yes, I have no regrets concerning my work.

320
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,436
Liar! You just can't forget about Ms. Yui, right?

321
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,548
But I don't mind.

322
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:30,515

325
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,115
That's the headquarters for Gehirn.

326
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,626
Good morning, Director.

327
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,109
Did you bring your child today?

328
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,978
Oh, but you have a son, if I'm not mistaken.

329
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,580
This isn't Shinji.

330
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,511
I'm taking care of a friend's daughter.

331
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,251
Her name is Rei Ayanami.

332
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,832
Hello, Rei.

333
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,472
This girl reminds me of someone...

334
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,699
Ms. Yui?

335
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,904
All files concerning Rei Ayanami
have been erased already?

336
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:07,466
It's blank.

337
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,167
What does this mean?

338
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,233

and Magi Melchior.

340
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,909
The Magi are the three parts
that make up who I am.

341
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:22,360
The scientist in me, the mother in me,
and the woman in me.

342
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,084
And those three elements will be in
constant conflict with one another.

343
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,485
The three parts of you...

344
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,448
The only thing left is to power it up, right?

345
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,626
1'm going to go home early today.

346
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,061
Misato's coming back.

347
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:39,364
That's right, I didn't know she
was a member of Gehirn.

348
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,765
I believe she's in Germany?

349
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,001
Yes, she's serving in Branch 3.

350
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,370
Then I suppose it's a long-distance relationship.

351
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,771
I heard they broke up.

352
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,941
Oh, and they looked so good together too.

353
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,010
You can never tell with a man and a woman,

354
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,645
because it's not logical.

355
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:55,896
That cool attitude of yours
certainly hasn't changed.

356
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:59,086
You're going to let your own
happiness slip away.

357
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:02,423
Happiness is even harder to define.

358
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:06,391
Well, it's been a long time since
I've gone drinking.

359
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,626
Goodnight.

360
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:08,767
Goodnight.

361
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,376
Did you want something, Rei?

362
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,011
I got lost.

363
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:29,322
Oh, really? Then you want to
leave here with me?

364
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:31,983
That's okay.

365
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,352
But you won't be able to get home
by yourself, right?

366
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,463
That's none of your business, you old hag.

367
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,190
What?

368
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,681
I can go home by myself,
so leave me alone, you old hag.

369
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:45,797
It's not nice to call someone an old hag.

370
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,999
But you are an old hag, aren't you?

371
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,670
I'm going to get mad. You need
a good scolding from Director lkari.

372
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,506
That's what the Director calls you.

373
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:55,340
That...

374
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:56,942
He says, “That old hag is pushy,”

375
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:59,053
or that he, “doesn't need that old hag anymore.”

376
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,146
He says, “That old hag is pushy,”

377
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:03,167
or that he, “doesn't need that old hag anymore.”

378
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,451
He doesn't need that old hag anymore.

379
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:10,202
It's what the Director calls you.

380
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,730
You're nothing but a...

381
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:21,299
It doesn't matter if you die,
you can always be replaced.

382
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,379
Rei...

383
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:24,629
The same as me.

384
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:37,115
The Human Instrumentality Project Committee,
chaired by Kiel Lorenz,

385
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,285
dissolved the research organization,
Gehirn, the next day.

386
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,354
And they formed the special duty
organization, Nerv,

387
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:44,889
as the organization that would
carry out all projects.

388
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,793
All of us were moved directly into Nerv,

389
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:53,794
with the exception of one, Dr. Akagi,
the remarkable creator of the Magi System.

390
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:54,886
Year 2015

391
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:01,506
Oh, it's you.

392
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,008
Long time no see.

393
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,259
I've put the guards outside to sleep for a while.

394
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:09,481
This will cost you your life.

395
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,351
I just want to get closer to the truth

396
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,293
within myself.

397
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,888
Thank you very much for your cooperation.

398
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,892
Is it over?

399
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,233
Yes, the problem has been resolved, so...

400
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,377
I see.

401
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,100
What about him?

402
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,241
I do not know.

403
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,439
Hey, you're late.

404
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:51,913
I'm home.

Katsuragi, it's me.

408
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:38,403
I've probably put you through a lot of trouble

409
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,544
by the time you're listening to this.

410
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:42,974
I'm sorry.

411
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,084
Tell Ritchan I said I'm sorry too.

412
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:48,146
Also, since I've troubled you so much anyway,

413
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:50,582
there's this flower I've been growing...

414
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,773
I1t'd make me happy if you'd water it for me.

415
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:55,753
Shinji knows where it is.

416
00:20:57,056 --> 00:21:00,016
Katsuragi, the truth is with you.

417
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,606
Go forward without any hesitation.

418
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:06,416
If I ever get to see you again,

419
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,376
I'll say the words I wasn't able
to say eight years ago.

420
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,036
Bye.

421
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,347
Message recorded at 12:02pm.

422
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,050
Jerk...

423
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,859
You're really such a jerk...

424
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:49,345
Right then, all I could do was
run away from Misato.

425
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:54,453
There was nothing I could do or say.
I was a child.

426
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:57,916
It made me realize that.

00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,667

Asuka falls into a psychological pitfall
due to having lost to Shiniji.

430
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,224
Furthermore, the psychological attack
from an Angel

431
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,293
delivers the finishing blow to Asuka's mind.

432
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:18,496
Shinji is unable to offer her
any words of comfort.

433
