Hey, have you seen her yet?

16
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,460
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

17
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,527
Seen who?

18
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:37,663
You dork, you haven't seen
the foreign girl yet?

19
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:38,798
Foreign girl?

20
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,933
Yeah, she's in 8th grade, Class A.

21
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,564
She just transferred here last week.

22
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,301
She's hot!

23
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:48,307
Her name's Asuka Langley Sohryu,
did you know that?

Her name's Asuka Langley Sohryu,
did you know that?

25
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:51,009
Her name's Asuka Langley Sohryu,
did you know that?

26
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:53,512
She's seriously cute.

27
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,348
Since she was raised over there
but born here,

28
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,249
do you think she matured early?

29
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,651
Don't be stupid!

30
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:01,119
I bet she broke up in Germany,
and she's here in a foreign land

31
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,889
with a heart that can't be mended.

32
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,256
To Miss Sohryu
with a heart that can't be mended.

33
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,807
To Miss Sohryu

34
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,228
Oh, man...

35
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,765
Everybody and their brother!

36
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:15,668
Asuka! Asuka!

37
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:16,936
They're just ignorant.

38
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:18,487
Thank you, come again.

39
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:22,743
At least the pictures don't
reveal her personality.

40
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,543
Hello!

41
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,946
Shinji!

42
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:28,614
Guten Morgen!

43
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,549
Guten morgen...

44
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,830
Hey, why so gloomy this early?
This is the gorgeous Asuka greeting you!

45
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,102
Look a little more happy about it!

46
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,328
So the other one's here too, isn't she?

47
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,329
Who's that?

48
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,166
What are you, stupid? I'm talking about
the First Child, of course!

49
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,777
Oh, if it's Ayanami...

50
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,880
Hello!

51
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,781
You must be Rei Ayanami,
the pilot of the prototype.

52
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,655
I'm Asuka! Asuka Langley Sohryu.

53
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:13,259
I'm the pilot of Eva Unit 02.
Let's be good friends!

54
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,359
Why?

55
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:18,064
Because it'd be convenient, in lots of ways.

56
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,433
If I'm ordered to, I will.

57
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:21,900
Talk about odd.

58
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:25,471
I'll say. Are only weirdos chosen
to be pilots?

59
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,349
Have you lost some weight?

60
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,451
Have I?

61
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,386
You must be enduring an unrequited love.

62
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,137
How did you know?

63
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:46,726
Because...

64
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,261
"A woman with a mole in
the pathway of her tears

65
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,797
is destined to a life full of them."

66
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,799
If you're trying to put a move on me,
I'm afraid you can't.

67
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,761
There's a very scary lady watching us.

68
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,042
Long time no see, Kaji.

69
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,677
It's been a while.

70
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:07,747
You're actually pretty careless,
aren't you, Kaji?

71
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,149
He's as much of an idiot as ever.

72
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,986
If you're done handing over Unit 02,
hurry up and leave!

73
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:17,857
I just received orders this morning
that I'll be staying here on loan.

74
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:21,193
So the three of us can hang out again,
just like we used to.

75
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,804
Who'd hang out with YOU?

76
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,931
Enemy attack?!

77
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,601
We just got this report from the
patrolling battlecruiser Haruna.

78
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,972
"Huge submerged object detected off
Ki'i peninsula. Sending data."

79
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,040
The data has been collated.

80
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,343
Wavelength pattern Blue.
Confirmed to be an Angel.

81
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,411
All personnel, go to
battle stations, Level One.

82
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:42,431
Episode 9
Moment and
Heart Together

83
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:49,885
The recent battle severely damaged
the intercept system of New Tokyo-3.

84
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:53,459
We've only effected 26 percent
of the repairs at present.

85
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,039
And our operational capability for
actual combat is virtually nil.

86
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,232
Therefore, we'll crush the target
in a single blow

87
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,334
at the water's edge, right
before it makes landfall!

88
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:06,372
Units 01 and 02 will mount an attack
in a series of waves.

89
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:07,773
In other words, close in and take turns.

90
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:08,908
Roger.

91
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:12,178
This sucks. It's my Japanese debut.

92
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:14,429
Why won't she let me take it out myself?

93
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:18,384
It can't be helped. That's the strategy.

94
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:22,105
Let me tell you something,
just don't get in my way!

95
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,003
Why did someone like him get chosen
to be a pilot?

96
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:43,197
Two against one isn't a fair fight.
I don't like it. Not my style.

97
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:48,834
We don't have the luxury of choosing
our means to survive.

98
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:53,849
Here it comes!

99
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,794
Commence attack!

100
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:04,330
Okay, I'll go first! Back me up!

101
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:05,631
Back you up?

102
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,032
Ladies first!

103
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,523
Sheesh, don't order me around!
You're the new onel!

104
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:16,612
I can take him!

105
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,280
Amazing!

106
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,028
Well, Third Child?!

107
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,399
A fight should be elegant and without waste.

108
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,471
That's cheating!

109
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:01,287
Today, at 10:58:15 AM,

110
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:04,823
Unit 01 was attacked by Target A,

111
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:07,993
which split from the target
submerged 2 km off Suruga Bay.

112
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:12,364
At the same time, plus 20 seconds,
Unit 02 was halted by Target B.

113
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:15,534
We have a comment from
the chair of Project E.

114
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,735
This is pathetic.

115
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:20,973
This is all your fault! You totally
screwed up my debut battle!

116
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,207
What are you talking about?

117
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,977
You're the one who did something stupid!

118
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:28,380
Stupid?! Where does a lamebrain like you
get off calling me that?

119
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:29,848
That's just shameless!

120
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:33,385
What do you mean?! We got in this trouble
because you were in such a rush to defeat it!

121
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,954
What was that? You look like a drowned rat!
How lame!

122
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,855
At 11:03 AM, NERV abandoned the operation
What was that? You look like a drowned rat!
How lame!

123
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,824
At 11:03 AM, NERV abandoned the operation
Like you can talk!

124
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:39,892
Like you can talk!

125
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:43,028
and transferred command to
the UN Secondary Force.

126
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,597
You've humiliated us.

127
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,668
At 11:05 AM, the UN forces made
an attack with an N2 mine.

128
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,638
We'll have to re-draw the map again.

129
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:52,838
7th Angel AJB

130
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,274
7th Angel AJB
They succeeded in burning off 28%
of the target's structural substance.

131
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:55,407
They succeeded in burning off 28%
of the target's structural substance.

132
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:55,641
7th Angel B
7th Angel A
They succeeded in burning off 28%

7th Angel A
Did they kill it?

This is merely temporary relief.
A second attack is a matter of time.
Report: Department of Investigation Division 2,
Nerv Scientific Investigation Branch

135
00:07:59,112 --> 00:07:59,778
This is merely temporary relief.
A second attack is a matter of time.

136
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:03,749
At least it bought us time to regroup,
so we got something out of it.

137
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,784
Listen up, you two.

138
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,354
Do you know what your job is?

139
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:09,488
Piloting Eva.

140
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,790
No! Your job is to defeat the Angels.

141
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:15,861
Nerv does not exist to make
grotesque displays like this.

142
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,130
Therefore, you two must cooperate.

143
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,999
Why should we?!

144
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,290
Enough already.

145
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,105
Why's everyone so touchy here?

146
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,707
It's because adults don't like
to be embarrassed.

147
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,276
Where's Miss Misato?

148
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,787
Cleaning things up. The person in charge
exists to take responsibility.

149
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,985
Here are the internal protests
and damage reports,

150
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,755
and this is a bill from the UN,

151
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,656
and here you have complaints from
the PR department as well.

152
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,426
Make sure you read them all.

153
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,862
I don't have to read them
to know what they say.

154
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,498
“If you're going to fight, do it here," right?

155
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:53,832
How insightful.

156
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,823
I don't need them to tell me. I'll do it here
as soon as the topside gets cleaned up.

157
00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:00,472
I'll destroy the Angels without fail.

158
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,608
The Vice Commander is livid.

159
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:06,478
You'll almost certainly be demoted
if you embarrass him again.

160
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:10,082
It was a silver lining that
Commander Ikari wasn't here.

161
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,619
If he'd been here, you'd have been fired
before he ever saw these.

162
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,870
So, you brought me an idea
to help save my job, right?

163
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,525
Just one.

164
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,593
You're amazing, Dr. Ritsuko Akagi.

165
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,430
It's good to have kind friends from way back.

166
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:28,567
Unfortunately, I'm not the one who will be
bailing out my old friend.

167
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,169
To my honey
This is Kaji's idea.

168
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:30,769
This is Kaji's idea.

169
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,060
Kaji's?

170
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:50,832
I'm home! Not that anyone's here,
of course, but...

171
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,726
What is this?!

172
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,295
Don't be so rude!

173
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,263
Those are my personal belongings!

174
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,284
What are you doing here?!

175
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,435
It's more like, why are you still here?

176
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,726
Still here?

177
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,785
You've been dumped for the new model!

178
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,743
Misato will be living with me.

179
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:15,881
Well, it's the logical choice when you
consider whose abilities are superior.

180
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:18,350
Although honestly, I'd rather live with Mr. Kaji.

181
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:21,481
But why are Japanese rooms
so small anyway?

182
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,415
Not even half of my stuff fits!

183
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:26,898
Shin's Ro

184
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:32,164
On top of which, why don't the Japanese
have any sense of privacy?

185
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:35,901
How can they live in rooms without locks?
Unbelievable!

186
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:37,402
It's because the Japanese way

187
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,771
is to consider the priorities and needs
of others before one's own.

188
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:40,839
Miss Misato!

189
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,209
Welcome home! Looks like you're
getting along well already.

190
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,477
What do you mean?

191
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,379
This is all preparation for the next operation.

192
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,670
How's that?

193
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,817
The seventh Angel has one
and only one weakness!

194
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:55,521
A simultaneous two-point attack
on each target's core

195
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:56,542
while its components are separated.

196
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,400
In other words, an attack by two Evas
with perfectly synchronized timing.

197
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:05,891
For that, we'll need cooperation and
perfect coordination from you two.

198
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:10,633
Therefore, I'm having you two live together.

199
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:14,106
No way!

200
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:17,142
It's always been said that boys and girls
shouldn't sleep together after age seven!

201
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,444
The Angel is currently restoring itself.

202
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,747
It will begin its second assault in six days,
so there's no time.

203
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,708
But that's crazy!

204
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:27,853
So here's how to make the crazy possible.

205
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,589
In order for you to master perfect unison,

206
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,760
you'll memorize the attack pattern that's been
arranged to this music.

207
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:35,872
In six days, as soon as possible.

208
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:50,042
But I wonder what's happened to Shiniji.

209
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,973
He's been gone three days, right?

210
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,449
Hey, there's the class rep.

211
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,051
Two of the three stooges.

212
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,386
Why are you here?

213
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,690
To see how Miss Sohryu is doing.
What about you two?

214
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,025
To see how lkari's doing.

215
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,486
Why did you stop here?

216
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:13,088
Yes?

217
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:19,438
Traitor!

218
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,940
Matching outfits yet again,
in this day and age?!

219
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,142
I can't believe this!

220
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:28,893
Well, Miss Misato said that Japanese start by
dressing the part, so she made us...

221
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,018
That's filthy, you two!

222
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,786
You're wrong! You're wrong!

223
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,321
Two wrongs don't make a right!

224
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:37,612
Oh, welcome everybody!

225
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,285
Could ya please explain
what all this's about?

226
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,798
You shoulda told us that to begin with.

227
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,468
So how is the coordination coming?

228
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,339
Well, as you can see...

229
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,609
Are you surprised?!

230
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,413
There's no way I could possibly lower myself
to Shinji's level!

231
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:03,815
It's just an utterly impossible idea!

232
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,251
Then you give up?

233
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,031
You don't have anyone else, do you?

234
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,355
Rei?

235
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:10,889
Yes, Ma'am.

236
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:11,857
Why don't you try?
Yes, Ma'am.

237
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:12,157
Why don't you try?

238
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,448
Yes, Ma'am.

239
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:27,367
It looks like I should alter the
operation to pair Shinji and Rei.

240
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,496
No! I can't stand this! I've had enough!

241
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:40,052
Asuka!

242
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:40,719
Even the Devil cries sometimes.
Asuka!

243
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,220
Even the Devil cries sometimes.

244
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,881
Ikari!

245
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:49,016
Go after her!

246
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,656
You made a girl cry! Take responsibility!

247
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:02,307
Well...

248
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,342
Don't say anything.
Well...

249
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:03,723
Don't say anything.

250
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,881
I know.

251
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,632
I have no choice but to pilot the Eva.

252
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,343
Il do it.

253
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:21,927
Since it's come to this, I'll show up
both Rei and Misato!

254
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:24,162
You don't have to show them up or anything.

255
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,973
You're being too easy on them!
You're a man, aren't you?!

256
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,935
For their attack...

257
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,403
on my pride...

258
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,744
I'll pay them back ten times over!

259
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:45,905
Two More Days

260
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,925
Attack Tomorrow

261
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:15,714
Where's Misato?

262
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:18,645
At work. She called earlier.
She'll be there all night.

263
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,252
So that means we're all alone tonight.

264
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,108
Daily Calm Spirit

265
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,914
This is the impenetrable Wall of Jericho.

266
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,874
Take one step over this wall
and you're a dead man.

267
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,985
And now, it's time for children to go to bed!

268
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,543
How can the Japanese sleep on the floor?
I can't believe it.

269
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,093
Mama...

270
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,977
Mama...

271
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,242
You're just a child yourself.

272
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:18,502
No, somebody will see us.

273
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:19,104
Who's watching?

274
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,105
Someb...
Who's watching?

275
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:20,516
Someb...

276
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:45,163
Honestly! There's nothing
between us anymore.

277
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,798
Don't do that again.

278
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,408
But your lips didn't say no.

279
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,205
Your lips or your words...

280
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,906
Which one should I trust?

281
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,364
There you go.

282
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:20,865
Thanks.

283
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,701
You're unusually sober today.

284
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:25,036
Yeah, a little.

285
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,377
Work? Or a man?

286
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,530
A lot of things.

287
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,600
Still in love?

288
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,880
Don't say weird stuff like that!

289
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,751
Who'd want that jerk?!

290
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:41,519
It may have been a youthful indiscretion,

291
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,000
but I can't believe I was dating a jerk like him.
It's the biggest blemish on my life.

292
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,894
I meant that he may still like you.
Did I scare you?

293
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,262
Why you lousy...

294
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,903
Getting angry only shows [ hit a sore spot.

295
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,735
Why not be more honest with
your feelings this time?

296
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:59,004
Things are different than eight years ago.

297
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:02,165
It hasn't changed. Not a bit.
Still too immature.

298
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,908
Well, I've got to get to work.
Tomorrow is the big day.

299
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:22,927
Target has broken through
the final defense line at Gora.

300
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,596
Here it comes!

301
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,598
We won't fail this time!

302
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:29,668
Deploy your AT fields as soon
as the music starts.

303
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,269
Then stick to the operation.

304
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,071
Got it, you two?

305
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,606
Roger!

306
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,841
The target has entered the mountains.

307
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:40,578
Full power, maximum speed
from the start, got it?

308
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,748
I know that. We'll finish in sixty-two seconds.

309
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,384
Target entering Ground Zero.

310
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,675
Detach external power cables.

311
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,222
Launch.

312
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,213
Time remaining

313
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,099
Both Evas confirmed operational.

314
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,968
Geez...

315
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:11,259
This is pathetic.

316
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:19,010
You jerk! How dare you do that
to my Unit 02?1

317
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:21,946
What are you talking about?
You're the one who fell on me!

318
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:25,049
You're the one who lost his timing first!

319
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,051
It's because you're always so out of it!

320
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,487
What were you doing, staying up
so late last night?!

321
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,957
Image training for today's battle!

322
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,661
Liar! I know you tried to kiss me
while I was sleeping!

323
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,197
No fair! You were awake?!

324
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:43,701
That's awfull  was just kidding,
but it was real?! You kissed me?!

325
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:46,337
No, I didn't! I stopped!

326
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,840
Pervert! Lech! Fiend! I can't believe you!

327
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:52,880
It's because you talk in your sleep
and toss and turn so much!

328
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:57,015
Those kids are embarrassing us again.

329
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:59,596
To Be Continued

330
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,117
Preview

331
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,487
The crater of Mount Asama where
an unhatched Angel lies.

332
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,856
Nerv attempts the first capture of an Angel.

333
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:15,493
A specially-equipped Eva Unit 02
challenges the fires of Hell!

334
