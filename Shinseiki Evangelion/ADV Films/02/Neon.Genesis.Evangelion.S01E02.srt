Are you ready, Shinji?

16
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:37,413
Yes.

17
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,738
Release the final safety lock!

18
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:43,164
Evangelion Unit 01, lift off!

19
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,570
Shinji, just concentrate on walking right now.

20
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,541
Walk...

21
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,198
It walked!

22
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:05,892
Walk...

23
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:16,935
Shinji, get it together!

24
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,574
Hurry! Get up!

25
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,397
Shinji, calm down! That's not your arm!

26
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,048
What's going on with the
Eva's defense system?

27
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:40,662
The signal's not working!

28
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,156
The field's not deploying!

29
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:43,696
Have we failed?

30
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:49,691
Left arm damaged!

31
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,860
The circuits have disconnected!

32
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:54,867
Shinji, dodge!

33
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:02,608
There's a crack on the front of the cranium!

34
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,693
The armor won't last much longer!

35
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,494
The head's been damaged!
Extent of damage, unknown!

36
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,130
The control nerves are disconnecting
one after another!

37
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,561
We're not getting any readings on the pilot!

38
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:21,721
Shinji!

39
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,234
I don't know this ceiling.

41
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:12,374
So, the Angels have returned, eh?

42
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,112
It's so sudden.

43
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,137
It's the same as it was fifteen years ago.

44
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:19,796
A disaster comes as it will, without warning.

45
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,880
We could say it was fortunate, in the sense
that our prior investments were not a waste.

46
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,926
You can't be sure about that yet.

47
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,379
If it doesn't pay off, it's a waste all the same.

48
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,472
Precisely. Now that the Angels,

49
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,642
and the fact that we have been
manipulating information,

50
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,102
have become public knowledge,

51
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:44,012
Nerv must operate in a speedy
and prudent manner.

52
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:48,715
It's already been taken care of.
You may rest assured of that.

53
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,748
In regards to the declaration of
the special state of emergency,

54
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:54,727
government officials have announced...

55
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:55,981
This incident was...

56
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:57,186
UN forces in Japan...

57
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,199
So it's public scenario B-22.
In response to reporters' questions...

58
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,733
In response to reporters' questions...

59
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:00,833
No, there's no threat of contamination
from the center of the explosion.

60
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:03,335
So, we're hushing up the truth again?
No, there's no threat of contamination
from the center of the explosion.

61
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:03,969
But at least our PR people are thrilled
No, there's no threat of contamination
from the center of the explosion.

62
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,204
But at least our PR people are thrilled
The only Angel samples collected
were adhered to the Eva.

63
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:07,239
now that they've finally got something to do.
The only Angel samples collected
were adhered to the Eva.

64
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,740
We're being pretty casual about it.
The only Angel samples collected
were adhered to the Eva.

65
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,508
We're being pretty casual about it.
Correct, as in the model simulation,
approximately 99.9% of it evaporated.

66
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,678
I don't know about that.
I think everyone's actually scared.
Correct, as in the model simulation,
approximately 99.9% of it evaporated.

67
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:13,549
Correct, as in the model simulation,
approximately 99.9% of it evaporated.

68
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:14,977
Of course we are.

69
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,772
Well, we must acknowledge that.

70
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,848
Speaking of which, lkari,

71
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,223
isn't there a better way to
utilize Nerv and Eva?

72
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,243
First the repairs to Unit 00,

73
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,594
and now to Unit 01, which you
wrecked in its first battle.

74
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,825
It's enough to bankrupt an entire country.

75
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:35,080
We also understand that you
gave that toy to your son.

76
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,482
Manpower, time, and money.

77
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:41,936
How much more do you and your family
plan on wasting?

78
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,877
And that is not your only responsibility.

The Human Instrumentality Project,

81
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,130
The Human Instrumentality Project,

82
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:49,357
that should be your top priority.

83
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:50,536
Precisely.

84
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:57,046
Under these desperate circumstances,
that project is our one and only hope.

85
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:01,393
In any case, we cannot excuse any delays
in that project's schedule

86
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,094
due to the reappearance of the Angels.

87
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,390
We will consider the issue
regarding the budget.

88
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,260
Now, the rest of this meeting
concerns only the committee.

89
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,748
Your presence here was appreciated, lkari.

90
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:17,541
Ikari, there is no turning back.

91
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:21,943
I know.

92
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,793
Mankind has no time left.

94
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,569
Air conditioning has just got to be
mankind's greatest treasure.

95
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:57,087
It's the triumph of science over nature.

96
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,440
Shinji's woken up.

97
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,516
How is he?

98
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,891
No external injuries. His memory
is a bit muddled, however.

99
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,852
You don't think it could it be
mental contamination?

100
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,124
There appears to be no cause for worry.

101
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,513
Really?

102
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:15,586
I suppose he did have a pretty hectic day.

103
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:19,448
It's not suprising. His cranial nerves
took a lot of strain.

104
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,677
Don't you mean his heart?

105
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,928
Construction Plan Notice

106
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,863
Okay, okay. Keep it coming. Good!

107
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,134
If Eva and this city both operate
at their full potential,

108
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,850
maybe we can make it through this.

109
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:58,238
Are you going to defeat the Angels?
You're always such an optimist.

110
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:02,465
Hey, sometimes you need a little wishful
thinking just to keep on living.

111
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,795
I see your point. It helps to
hear things like that from you.

112
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:09,925
Seeya!

113
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,382
Are you sure?

114
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,093
They don't want to live together?

115
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:56,645
I think that living apart is natural
for Ikari and his son.

116
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:01,073
And being together is unnatural?

117
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:01,740
Shiniji lkari

118
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:02,975
Shiniji lkari
Alone?

119
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:03,146
Alone?

120
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:06,583
Right. His room will be in the 6th Block,
just beyond this one.

121
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,283
Is that satisfactory?

122
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:09,505
Yes.

123
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:11,906
Are you sure?

124
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,202
Shinji...

125
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,290
It's fine. I'd rather be alone.

126
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,979
Anywhere is fine.

127
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,731
What?!

128
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,799
So, I said, I'll take care of Shiniji.

129
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,261
I've already got permission from the brass.

130
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,497
Hey, it's not like I'm going to
â€œ"put the moves" on a kid.

131
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:30,833
Of course you're not!

132
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,997
What the hell are you thinking?

133
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:33,639
You're always like that. Honestly!

134
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,010
You're always like that. Honestly!
She just can't take a joke.

135
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,941
Well, we'll have to have a party tonight, right?

136
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:45,481
What for?

137
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,724
A welcoming party for my
new roommate, of course!

138
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,386
Convenience

139
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,677
So, you're going to move after all?

140
00:09:56,463 --> 00:10:01,002
Yes. I never dreamed that this city
would become a battlefield.

141
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,300
Yeah.

142
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,030
My husband's saying that our kid and 1
should evacuate, at the very least.

143
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,064
Evacuate, huh?

144
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:12,771
This city may be a fortress, but that's
no guarantee of safety.

145
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:16,303
Just remembering yesterday
gives me the chills.

146
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:25,330
I hope you don't mind if we make
a little stop on the way.

147
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,139
Where?

148
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:29,124
Someplace really cool.

149
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:38,594
It's just such a lonely city.

150
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,351
It's time.

151
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:10,484
Amazing! The buildings are growing!

152
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:29,215
This city is a fortress, designed to
protect against the Angels.

153
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,800
This is New Tokyo-3.

154
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,019
This is our city.

155
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:39,609
And it's the city that you helped to protect.

156
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,823
Your things should have already
been delivered, Shinji.

157
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:00,479
The truth is, I just recently moved
to this city too.

158
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,050
Come on in.

159
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:06,483
Pardon the intrusion.

160
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,724
Shiniji, this is YOUR home now.

161
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,687
I'm home.

162
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,843
Welcome home.

163
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,546
As you can see, the place
is a little bit messy,

164
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,273
but make yourself comfortable.

165
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,676
You call this

166
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,192
a "little bit" messy?

167
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,727
Oh! Sorry! Could you put the food
in the fridge?

168
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:39,421
Sure.

169
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,710
Ice,

170
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:43,442
snacks,

171
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,634
and nothing but beer.

172
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,342
What kind of a life does she lead?

173
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,483
Excuse me. What's in the other fridge?

174
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:02,031
Oh, don't mind that.
He's probably still sleeping!

175
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:03,819
Sleeping?

176
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,964
Let's eat!

177
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,368
Let's eat.

178
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,944
Life just doesn't get any better than this!

179
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:26,983
Don't you want to eat?
It's pretty good, even if it is instant.

180
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:31,314
I'm sorry, I'm just not used to it.

181
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,825
That's no excuse! You can't be so finicky.

182
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:39,041
No, that's not what I... well...

183
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,370
Isn't this nice?

184
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,435
Having dinner with somebody else!

185
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:47,108
Uh, yes.

186
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,631
Here we go for the next one.

187
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:54,332
Rock, paper, scissors...

188
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,495
Pon! Pon! Pon! Pon!

189
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,007
Sorry, Shinji.

190
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:06,458
Our Chores Chart
Day M T W Th F 8 Su
Chore
Breakfast S S M S S S 8
Dinner S S S M S S M
Okay! That should be it for fairly
splitting up the chores!

191
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:08,814
Yes.

192
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:11,595
Starting today, this is your home,

193
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:14,362
so you can take advantage
of everything here.

194
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,488
Yes.

195
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:19,619
Man. All you keep saying is yes, yes, yes.
It's so depressing!

196
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,616
You're a boy, aren't you?
Act like a man! Okay?

197
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,390
Yes.

198
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:26,882
Oh well.

199
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,700
Why don't you go take a bath and
scrub away all those bad memories?

200
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,208
Bathing is the laundry of life.

201
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,466
Miss Misato!

202
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:46,818
What?

203
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,839
Ap... p... p...

204
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,572
What?

205
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:54,494
Oh, him? He's one of those new
hot spring penguins.

206
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,136
What...

207
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:08,495
His name is Pen Pen.
He's your other roommate.

208
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:09,941
Why don't you cover that up?

209
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,010
Toothpicks
Why don't you cover that up?

210
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:17,401
Toothpicks

211
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,954
I wonder if I've been a little bit TOO cheery?

212
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,831
Maybe I'm the one who's transparent.

213
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,175
Miss Misato Katsuragi.

214
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:30,759
She's not a bad person.

215
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,031
Bathing is the laundry of life.

216
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:37,733
But bad memories always seem to find me
when I'm in the bath.

217
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,368
My father

218
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:42,984
and Rei Ayanami...

219
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,619
So, how was Rei today?

220
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,413
You went to the hospital this
afternoon, didn't you?

221
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:57,189
She'll be ready to work again in twenty days.

222
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,590
By then, we'll be ready to re-activate
Unit 00 from cryo-stasis.

223
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,018
It must be so hard on those children.

224
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:08,033
There is no one else who can pilot the Evas.

225
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:10,802
As long as they survive, that is what
I'll have them do.

226
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,933
With no regard to what they may want?

227
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,377
Little Shin's Room

228
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,672
No. 1 Public Middle School
Transfer Application
Shiniji lkari

229
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:35,360
Yeah, after all the horrible stuff
he went through,

230
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,111
there's no telling if he'll pilot it again.

231
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:40,661
Maintaining him is part of your job.

232
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:44,328
I'm just scared. I don't know
how to deal with him.

233
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:48,874
Grumbling already? You were the one
who had the bright idea of taking him in.

234
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:49,775
Shut up!

235
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,160
That time, I was thinking of Shinji as a tool.

236
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:57,724
I'm as bad as Ritsuko.

237
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,534
We destroyed that Angel.

238
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:03,928
But I guess I can't be happy about it.

239
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,901
Another ceiling I don't know.

240
00:17:11,396 --> 00:17:15,557
Of course. In this whole city,
there's no place that's familiar.

241
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,776
This is your home.

242
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,304
Why am [ here?

243
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,766
The head has been damaged!
Extent of damage, unknown!

244
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,634
We're having problems
maintaining activation!

245
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:50,569
Status report!

246
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,471
The synchrograph is reversing!
The pulses are flowing backward!

247
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,140
Break the circuit! Block it!

248
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:55,974
We can't!

249
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:58,076
It's rejecting the signal! It won't take it!

250
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:58,927
What about Shinji?

251
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,028
His monitors aren't responding.
Life signs unknown!

252
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:03,381
Unit 01's gone completely silent!

253
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,202
Misato!

254
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,284
This is it.

255
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,954
Abort the operation!
Rescuing the pilot is our first priority!

256
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:10,264
Force eject the entry plug!

257
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,556
We can't! It's completely out of control!

258
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:13,949
What the hell?!

259
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:23,835
The Eva's re-activating!

260
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,676
Impossible! There's no way it can move!

261
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,273
It can't be...

262
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,204
It's gone berserk?

263
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:50,959
It looks like we've won.

264
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,178
An AT field!

265
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,306
No! As long as the Angel
has that AT field up...

266
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,597
He can't touch the Angel!

267
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:07,512
Left arm, regenerated!

268
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:08,533
Incredible!

269
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,068
Unit 01 has deployed its AT field!

270
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,563
It's neutralizing the phase space!

271
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,270
No, it's eroding it!

272
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,866
It went through that AT field so easily...

273
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,409
It's going to self-destruct?!

274
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:24,923
Is the Eva...

275
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,170
That must be the Eva's...

276
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:37,999
true form.

277
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:46,745
Circuits reconnected.

278
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,180
Systems restored. Graphs back to normal.

279
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,015
Pilot life signs, confirmed.

280
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,951
Send out the recovery team. Hurry!

281
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:54,562
Preserving the pilot's life is our first priority.

282
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,013
Shinji, I'm coming in.

283
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,352
I forgot to tell you something.

284
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,282
You did a very praiseworthy thing today.

285
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:51,259
You should be proud of yourself.

286
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,051
Good night, Shinji.

287
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:57,916
Hang in there.

288
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,786

As Shinji lives his new life,

As Shinji lives his new life,
drifting along without direction,

292
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,757
there was no way for him to make friends.

293
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:16,628
But the fact that he is an Eva pilot
makes him popular in his class.
