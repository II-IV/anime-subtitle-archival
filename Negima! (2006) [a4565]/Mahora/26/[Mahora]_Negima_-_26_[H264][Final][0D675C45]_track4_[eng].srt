1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,100
And so, on a sunny and calm Sunday morning…

2
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,850
Go on, go home.

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,490
We have brought you home.

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,240
I guess it’s more natural for you to be in the forest.

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,090
Anya, sorry about this, after all the trouble you went through to catch it.

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,930
It’s okay. I wanted you to meet one anyway, so it’s fine.

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,960
Alright, go.

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,090
Uh, um… hold on!

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,430
Negi-sensei!

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,600
Aah! Stop! Stop!

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,690
He can’t follow you.

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,770
It wants to be with Negi-kun!

13
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,770
I think it likes Negi!

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,020
Eeh?

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,900
Wha…?

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,080
Negi has become a Chupacabra once, so won’t he have the scent of a friend?

17
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,610
Anyway, you can’t bring Negi with you.

18
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,050
Go home yourself.

19
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,750
We will come over and visit again!

20
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,110
Bye bye!

21
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,580
Laters!

22
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,260
Take care.

23
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,090
Negi…

24
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,600
That is…

25
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,810
What’s that, Negi?

26
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,590
He’s close.

27
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,490
He’s close.

28
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,710
Father is nearby!

29
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,650
Don’t say you are alone!

30
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,350
We will definitely meet each other again!

31
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,540
By Negi.

32
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,460
No. This is my problem.

33
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,760
EEERRRRK! NO WAY!

34
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,680
Everyone…

35
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,440
After you hear that, shouldn’t you be saying “You’re right!?”

36
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,100
She’s right, Negi-sensei!

37
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,100
We’re your partners after all!

38
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,810
Let’s find your father together!

39
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,110
And I was wondering why we should be gathering in class.

40
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,390
Negi, understand?

41
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,330
It’s important to trust your partners too!

42
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,040
Onee-chan.

43
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,110
You might not like what would happen if you refuse.

44
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,700
Anya.

45
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,480
Aniki, you should gratefully accept their powers.

46
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,630
Chamo-kun.

47
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,260
Alright. Understood.

48
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,850
Contract, activate!

49
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,930
Whoa! I really transformed!

50
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,460
It feels kinda embarrassing, doesn’t it?

51
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:17,610
Woah, I’m surprised, we became Chinese fairies!
It feels kinda embarrassing, doesn’t it?

52
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,710
Woah, I’m surprised, we became Chinese fairies!

53
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,440
That’s true! It’s awesome!

54
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,960
And now, for the Sukas.

55
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,320
Asuna-neesan.

56
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,520
Konoka-jouchan.

57
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,490
Nodoka-jouchan

58
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,620
And also…

59
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,660
The cheerleaders.

60
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,640
Chizuru-chan.

61
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,780
Natsumi-chan.

62
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,630
The rest are all cosplay…

63
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,880
There are only 3 sukas, aren’t these good results?

64
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,400
It’s by chance though.

65
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,410
Even so, it’s pretty good.

66
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,930
Well, even when making contracts, 31 people sure is a lot.

67
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,310
Why am I even…

68
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,550
Isn’t it good, master?

69
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,120
"The journey requires companions and the world requires compassion."

70
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,090
Don’t force metaphors that don’t work!

71
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,260
Alright, everyone. Sorry for the trouble, but thanks for your help!

72
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,010
Yes!

73
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,670
Alright. Where should we look first, Ojou-sama?

74
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,680
Nipaa~

75
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,360
This is so enjoyable!

76
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,400
Oh man, if this goes on, I want to take her home!

77
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,160
Oh no!

78
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,670
What am I thinking!?

79
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,290
To bring Ojou-sama home!?

80
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,280
Please forgive me, Ojou-sama.

81
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,420
Please forget what I just said!

82
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,380
C’mon, hug me!

83
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,890
Sure!

84
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,260
Eh, I mean, NO! I cannot do that!

85
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,400
My mind is always filled with wicked thoughts!

86
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,210
Huggle!

87
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,390
Please forgive me!

88
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:13,670
Huggle huggle!

89
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,710
Please spare me!
Huggle huggle!

90
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,130
Please spare me!

91
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,270
Please spare me!

92
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,880
What are they doing anyway?

93
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,610
Always the comedians.

94
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,610
It’s comedy?

95
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,070
Alright, from here on let’s split into two teams.

96
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,500
Kuu Fei-san and I will examine downstairs.

97
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,360
Makie-san and the rest will do upstairs from here.

98
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,850
Understood!

99
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,870
Come, Kuu Fei-san.

100
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,660
What have you been drinking anyway?

101
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,080
Black vinegar, aru.

102
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,590
It’s good for health, aru.

103
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,380
You look drunk.

104
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,090
I’m not, aru.

105
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,090
Well that’s fine.

106
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:54,920
Let’s go.

107
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,310
Yeah, aru!

108
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,520
Right, let’s go too!

109
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,650
Father!

110
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,030
By Eva.

111
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,950
Is it alright not to help in the investigation?

112
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,520
Why me?

113
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,200
It’s the Thousand Master.

114
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,790
When we met,

115
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,320
I never thought I’d wield magic.

116
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,700
When I got back I only felt unhappiness.

117
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,460
That which you don’t have in your heart…

118
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,210
What are you trying to say?

119
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,640
That’s…

120
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,190
Cute.

121
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,480
I’m going to get rid of it!

122
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,480
By Asuna.

123
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,690
Look, Negi!

124
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,400
Black Rose?

125
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:49,730
Black Rose Ba…

126
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,290
You don’t have to do it.

127
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,880
Black mule!

128
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,780
You don’t look like it at all…

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,910
This feeling is…

130
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,970
Thousand Master?

131
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,990
That’s shocking!

132
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,790
But, why is it here?

133
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,980
It might be a hint.

134
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,980
A hint?

135
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,750
You mean a "Try and look for me!" thing?

136
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:08,670
Alright.

137
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,210
What are you going to do?

138
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,940
Ras Tel Ma Scir Magister!

139
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,660
The light that guides us…

140
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,520
Those who exchange vows…

141
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,260
Spirits of all things of the night…

142
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,750
Show us the path…

143
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,980
To the bonds that we so desire!

144
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,400
Negi… can use this kind of magic?

145
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,280
Yeah. Takamichi taught it to me.

146
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,730
That’s awesome.

147
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,440
Anya…

148
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,780
It looks like a magnifying glass that can see the future, de gozaru.

149
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,470
Fumika is awesome!

150
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,430
This means that…

151
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,140
If we can see the future…

152
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,260
We will be able to see our adult selves!

153
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,720
Oho, that is interesting.

154
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,400
I would like to look at my future, de gozaru.

155
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,570
No problem, desu!

156
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,070
Let me be a wonderful lady in the future, de gozaru!

157
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,630
Eh? What’s going on, de gozaru?

158
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,290
Did something terrible happen in my future!?

159
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,630
Noooo!

160
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,790
Just what do you mean "no!?"

161
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,670
We can’t say!

162
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,630
You can’t say!?

163
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,940
Hello?

164
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,320
Fuuka-san, Fumika-san! Can you hear me?

165
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,360
Oh! Negi-sensei!

166
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,300
Lend me your powers!

167
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,300
Powers?

168
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,340
This is a first.

169
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:44,980
It sure is!

170
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,940
You girls use your magical powers of deduction and do something about it!

171
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,730
Magical Roger!

172
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,170
So what part of this is magical?

173
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,570
Over here or…

174
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,570
over here and stuff.

175
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,770
Don’t tell me it was a life mistake?

176
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,830
Yeah…

177
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,120
If that were the case, what happened?

178
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,070
Ah, well something was up.

179
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,670
It’s an adult thing…

180
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,670
My future is…

181
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,620
Hey, is it really okay to just disappear?

182
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,100
It’s an emergency.

183
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,170
You want Nodoka to try it?

184
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,940
Consumables should be checked first.

185
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,520
Or you’ll feel insecure.

186
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,150
Here you go.

187
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,310
You’re evil.

188
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,920
It’s just juice.

189
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,040
It’s not dangerous.

190
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,490
Then why don’t you drink it yourself?

191
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,990
I feel sorry for Negi-sensei but…

192
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:03,740
Before the investigation, I believe we still need to make records of this costume.

193
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,060
Magical girl Chiu is MOE.

194
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,890
There’s no disputing who the number one net idol is now!

195
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,390
Magical Girl begins!

196
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,230
Alright! We will now do a Magical Girl transformation!

197
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,810
Is this really a Magical Girl?

198
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,910
I give up.

199
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,030
Desu~

200
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,700
We’re sorry!

201
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,320
It’s okay.

202
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,540
I was the one who forced you to do it. Please don’t worry about it.

203
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,750
Negi-sensei is kind!

204
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,340
Alright. Let’s try again.

205
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:39,220
Ras Tel Ma Scir Magister!

206
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,460
That is…

207
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,310
Konoka!

208
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,110
Secchan, faster!

209
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,060
Yes, Ojou-sama!

210
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,560
Faster!

211
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,270
Yes, Ojou-sama!

212
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,420
What was that…

213
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,110
That looks fun…

214
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,530
They completely forgot what they were supposed to do though.

215
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,460
My future is…

216
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,290
Stop right there.

217
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,050
We have risked our lives for cheerleading.

218
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,140
The three of us are the fingers of our teacher!

219
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:30,140
We are here to cleanse thy dirty soul!

220
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,600
The Misa of Lilian.

221
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,600
Madoka of Yoyo.

222
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,070
Sakurako of the beads.

223
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,150
We, the cheerleaders have arrived!

224
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,090
Alright, hand over that circus girl!

225
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,700
You wish.

226
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,800
Wow. She’s good.

227
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,440
Thank you.

228
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,400
Ryukyu.

229
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,640
Sakamoto Kyu.

230
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,690
STOP FOOLING AROUND AND START YOUR INVESTIGATION!

231
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,240
Yes, Maurice…

232
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,490
OWW!

233
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,200
It got clipped in the crack…

234
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,870
Geez. You’re so clumsy, Yuuna.

235
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,460
Thank you, Ako!

236
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,080
What? Looks like he’s not here either.

237
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,300
Yeah. I wonder where Negi’s dad is anyway.

238
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,390
What are you doing, Hakase?

239
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,720
Well, since you asked…

240
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,410
Whoa, huge.

241
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,310
It’s a plastic model!

242
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:59,060
This bag seems to contain things that I wished I had, yet they somehow come in an incomplete state.

243
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,170
Wow. It would be nice if we could finish making them.

244
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,680
That’s what I was thinking.

245
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,960
I was thinking that it would be nice if we could build a satellite…

246
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,850
that would be able to search for Negi-sensei’s dad.

247
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,410
Ah, I see. So that’s what this is.

248
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,370
Alright! Let’s start defiling it!

249
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,210
Using the dry brush, let’s make it real.

250
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,060
Just like the German Army!

251
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,040
But it’s a satellite…

252
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,920
Over there. There. Here.

253
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,630
Ah, this is so convenient.

254
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,180
Natsumi…

255
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,890
Ah, we’re still in the middle of an investigation.

256
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,100
Return!

257
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,130
I’m sorry Chizu-nee. Let’s go.

258
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,080
How do you use this anyway?

259
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,090
It’s a serving tray, right?

260
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,100
A magical one.

261
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,570
I know! If we use this to make tea, you’ll be blessed with descendants!

262
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:50,990
What are you talking about…

263
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,950
Oh, and if you hold it under your armpit your breasts will grow bigger!

264
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,620
I don’t get it.

265
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,040
Grow up! Grow up!

266
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,120
It’s not going to happen!

267
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,750
This is Chilli Sauce?

268
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,340
As expected of Mexican Meat Buns.

269
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,050
It tastes great as a snack.

270
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,990
Why, thank you.

271
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,970
Um, so Takahata-sensei…

272
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,110
I wonder about the Russian one.

273
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,310
Ooh. Piroshki flavored!

274
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,210
This one is great.

275
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,240
What else is there?

276
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,140
Takahata-sensei…

277
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,690
I think it’s time we head back to our investigation…

278
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,780
I see it now…

279
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,990
Eh?

280
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,670
I just thought up a new type of Ramen!

281
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,850
I thought up a name too: Meat Bun Noodles!

282
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,370
So is it a meat bun? Or noodles?

283
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,740
Ah, but it’s great right?

284
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,120
Sensei, well we should be on our way…

285
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,860
Alright.

286
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,130
It’s time to get working!

287
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,210
Satsuki-kun, Lingshen-kun, help me out.

288
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,470
Fight-O!

289
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:01,180
I see, there are no clues there either, huh?

290
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,310
Come to think of it Misora, that cosplay is… quite awesome.

291
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,080
Oh. I guess so…

292
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,700
Anyway, let’s check out the dorms and search there.

293
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,360
Sure.

294
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,320
I want to use transformation powers but…

295
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,210
We don’t really understand it, so…

296
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,950
Oh well, we’ll forget it for now.

297
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,730
I, too, as an expert, shall assist you.

298
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,460
Thank you, Daddy!

299
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,940
Oh yeah, Maki-chan…

300
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,470
Why do you call Motsu your daddy?

301
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,880
Ah, I’m also wondering why…

302
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,890
If you don’t mind…

303
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:41,910
Oh. That’s right. I haven’t told you guys about it yet…

304
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,390
Here! This is my Daddy!

305
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,110
It was taken last month. The Latest Version!

306
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,320
Oh? He’s still alive?

307
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,720
He’s alive! Don’t say such ominous things.

308
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,350
What the hell? I was just a bit disappointed.

309
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,820
Don’t say you’re disappointed!

310
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,900
Maki-chan’s daddy is really handsome!

311
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,160
Eh? Really?

312
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,920
But… He doesn’t look anything like him, does he?

313
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,650
Yeah. That’s true.

314
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,400
Completely different.

315
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,900
Really? I thought I looked a lot like Enomoto.

316
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,800
He’s got a really pleasant feeling face, in a good way.

317
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,690
Pleasant looking?

318
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,410
Oh, there!

319
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,680
It really looks like him!

320
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,680
Maki-chan, this dog…

321
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,540
Yes! That’s Daddy!

322
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,600
Don’t tell me, your dog’s name is…

323
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,820
Daddy?

324
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,820
Yes.

325
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,290
Why?

326
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,320
You see, when that dog came to our house…

327
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,160
Daddy!

328
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,910
Such a cute kid.

329
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,250
Daddy!

330
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,960
You have grown.

331
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,800
Daddy!

332
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,610
By your side, as always.

333
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,700
Whenever I call out for daddy, he’s always the one to turn around.

334
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,280
Man, he’s a really troublesome stupid dog.

335
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,440
So, since I had no choice, I gave him the name "Daddy."

336
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,620
Oh. What is it, Daddy?

337
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,070
See you look like him right?

338
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,660
See?

339
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,410
Stupid dog.

340
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,670
Stupid dog!

341
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,740
STUPID DOG!

342
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,330
STUPID DOOOOOG!

343
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,260
Hey, Daddy!

344
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,560
He can even fly…

345
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,880
May he rest in peace in heaven…

346
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:45,500
To hell with the humans!

347
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,520
Keep it together, Kuu Fei-san!

348
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,240
I know, aru!

349
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,480
This cosplay is drunk, aru!

350
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,900
The more drunk I get the stronger I become!

351
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,820
Getting drunk from black vinegar… Ugh!

352
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,200
Iinchou-san! Do you hear me?

353
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,300
Wah? Negi-sensei?

354
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,540
It’s finished!

355
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,510
Whoa!

356
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,030
For us, it’s the beginning of a great era.

357
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,880
Alright! Let’s try firing it!

358
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,300
Sure!

359
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,090
Hey, so how are we going to launch it?

360
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,430
My ability to seek out a smell?

361
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,360
Yes.

362
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,190
Using your powers,

363
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,290
you can use that black rose…

364
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,970
to find out where my father is.

365
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,310
I understand.

366
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,710
Leave it to me.

367
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,910
I see it!

368
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,080
On the lake shore!

369
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,930
Negi!

370
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,230
In the end, you were bothered by it, weren’t you?

371
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,630
I’m only going for a walk.

372
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,300
Boy…

373
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,530
Father!

374
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,630
Motsu-san.

375
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,780
Shichimi-san.

376
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,750
Master has just left, mya.

377
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,570
Looks like he intended to leave without meeting with you…

378
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,800
So, you guys are…

379
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,680
Thousand Master’s servants, mya.

380
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,440
Well, that was until not too long ago anyway.

381
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,360
From now on, we were ordered to be your servants, mya.

382
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,400
Mine…?

383
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,110
Also, he left a message for you.

384
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,460
"Grow up happily."

385
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,740
"Grow up happily."

386
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,180
Negi-chan.

387
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,100
We’re back.

388
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,870
Wow, we were transformed for a long time this time.

389
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,140
It’s because of Negi-kun’s powers.

390
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:00,410
He’s still growing, that boy.

391
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,100
Thanks to everyone.

392
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:03,960
Negi…

393
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,370
Father, I will work hard.

394
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,260
I will work as hard as I can,

395
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,810
and become a magician like you.

396
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,770
So, watch me.

397
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,710
Father.

398
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,180
We’re back.

399
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:06,100
Yeah. We’re back.

400
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,880
Come on, let’s go.

401
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,630
Everyone’s waiting.

402
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:18,170
Negi-sensei!

403
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,180
Come, let’s race.

404
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:22,960
I’m not gonna lose!

405
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,010
Me neither.

406
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,150
I’m not going to lose either.

407
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,360
Go!

408
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,040
The story of the magician has just begun.

409
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,620
With the 31 girls as his beautiful partners, together, they will strive!

410
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:47,330
For Negi to become a Magister Magi, and aim for his father!

411
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,740
Tel Ma Amorista!
