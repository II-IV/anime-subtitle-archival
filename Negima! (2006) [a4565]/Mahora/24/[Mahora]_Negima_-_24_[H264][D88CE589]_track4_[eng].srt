1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:09,290
With the help of his students, Negi managed to free Evangeline from the Star Crystal’s command.

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,400
But, while everyone was calming down…

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,720
Negi was sucked in by the Star Crystal!

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,020
What’s going to happen next?

5
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,970
"Negi-sensei, looks like it’s the climax now!" by Akira.

6
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,970
"Let’s all go home together ok, Negi-kun!" by Misora.

7
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,270
Negi-sensei!

8
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,190
Negi-sensei…

9
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,260
Negi-sensei!!!

10
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,500
Negi!

11
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,780
Negi-sensei!

12
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,860
Asuna-san…

13
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,000
Nodoka-san…

14
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,080
Are you hurt anywhere?

15
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,860
Konoka-san, I’m…

16
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,250
You’re fine now, Negi-sensei.

17
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,850
Setsuna-san…

18
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,580
But… where is this place?

19
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,380
I don’t know why but… everything just kinda turned into this.

20
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,420
It looks like it was made with the enemy’s magic.

21
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,300
Magic…

22
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,500
Whoa! It’s huge!

23
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,520
Amoris!

24
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,740
Now!

25
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,350
Takahata-sensei, where’s Negi?

26
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:27,500
Where’s the Star Crystal that sucked up Negi-sensei?

27
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,110
This magical world was created by the Star Crystal.

28
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:37,990
So, if we really want to "get back," we have to get back the Star Crystal.

29
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,270
So, the Star Crystal is essentially… the magic world?

30
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:49,570
Moreover, it's probably easier to think of the Star Crystal as the sole reason why this world even exists.

31
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,310
Yeah. That’s right Hakase-kun.

32
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,410
I see. So that’s what it means.

33
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,310
Did ya get all that, Kuu-chan?

34
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,140
I totally don’t understand, aru!

35
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,230
Well that’s good! There’re a TON of people who don’t get it, either!

36
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,100
Birds of a feather, aru!

37
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,850
What bird?

38
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,610
Actually, Natsumi doesn’t understand either, I bet!

39
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,790
Eh? I-I do!

40
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,490
No way!

41
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,530
Eep!

42
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,700
I know. Natsumi, lying will cause you to become shorter, you know.

43
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,160
I already knew from the get-go!

44
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,700
Hey, Takahata sensei, do we even know how Negi-kun’s doing right now?

45
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,660
What are we going to do if he gets hurt?

46
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,250
Ehh!? No way!

47
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,320
Takamichi… isn’t there anything we can do about it?

48
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,820
To find out about his condition?

49
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,580
Well, I’ll see what I can do.

50
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,000
The forest is-!!

51
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,810
This is bad!

52
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:51,800
Nekane-kun!

53
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,380
Alright!

54
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,790
I guess we’re alright for now.

55
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:12,300
But since these two are holding up that force field, we can’t find out about Aniki’s condition.

56
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,790
Eeh!? No way!

57
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,590
What about Evangeline?

58
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,940
Ah! That’s right!

59
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,970
Eva can use Western Magic, too!

60
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,300
Hey Eva! Work your magic!

61
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,460
No.

62
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,040
WHAAAAT!?

63
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:31,480
Forgive me for speaking out-of-place, but you have made a contract with Negi-sensei, Master.

64
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,280
I’m not sure if that obligates you to provide some assistance, though…

65
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,440
Stop it with the contract talk!

66
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,440
Please! Eva-san!

67
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,070
No.

68
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,140
A-Alright… but only just this once…

69
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,210
As expected from Asuna Ane-san.

70
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,720
Lic

71
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,720

72
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,720

73
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,720

74
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,720
lilac

75
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,150
Oh, closed doors…

76
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,150
The last flower petal,

77
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,450
Retrieve us just one ray of light, and focus it upon my wings.

78
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,000
La

79
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,000

Spiritus!

81
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,980
We got it!

82
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,180
Negi-sensei!

83
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,550
What a relief… He’s alright!

84
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,620
Eh? We’re there…

85
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,990
You’re right… What’s going on?

86
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,770
Those are illusions!

87
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,450
Illusions… Fluids that cannot flow.

88
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,100
Negi-sensei doesn’t look like he realizes that yet.

89
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,750
Negi, you dunce!

90
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,470
The real things are right here!

91
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,570
He can’t hear us here.

92
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,500
Eva! Make it so he CAN hear us!

93
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,030
Don’t ask for the impossible!

94
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,860
Is something happening on the other side?

95
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,560
They’re probably out to deceive Negi-sensei.

96
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,420
It must be a trick. Negi-bouzu, please be careful!

97
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,700
Negi…

98
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,870
Wow… This place is high…

99
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,630
I can’t see down there…

100
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,510
I wonder what’s down there…

101
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,390
Isn’t it dangerous?

102
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,000
But, even if we continued to run around up here…

103
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,010
Boy, go have a look.

104
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,920
You have a staff, right? Try and see what’s there for a bit.

105
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,580
Negi-kun! Don’t do it!

106
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,800
It might be that down there is…

107
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,280
… the Underworld.

108
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,470
The magic world is a black hole!

109
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,130
Black hole!?

110
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,790
If Negi-sensei ever gets sucked into that…

111
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:28,940
Negi…

112
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,210
DON’T!!!!

113
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,430
Go down there, Negi.

114
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,780
You’re our homeroom teacher, aren’t you?

115
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,280
We’re lost, so go and lead us down the right path!

116
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,530
It’s back!

117
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,990
This time there’s tons of it!

118
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,170
Eva-san!

119
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,510
Go quickly!

120
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,530
Leave it to me!

121
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,130
I’m from Class A, too. I don’t want to see my classmates get hurt.

122
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,040
Negi! You heard that right!?

123
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,240
Eva would never say that even if she were on her DEATH BED!

124
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,260
What!?

125
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,740
And a soft smile… Not even plausible!

126
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,650
Remember the real Eva!

127
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,410
Remember the incredibly impolite, incredibly heartless thing!

128
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,530
Hey you!

129
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,080
Hey! The screen is disappearing!

130
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,090
What are you doing!?

131
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,940
Hurry, boy!

132
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,620
No…

133
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,030
You are not Evangeline-san!

134
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,840
And, all of you!

135
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,000
Negi…

136
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,000
What are you saying?

137
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,760
That’s right Negi-kun…

138
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,210
Don’t say depressing things like that…

139
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,120
You can’t trick me.

140
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,760
You guys are not my students!

141
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,460
You are illusions!

142
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,840
As expected

143
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,840
Negi.

144
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,840
Well

145
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,840
observed.

146
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,510
You

147
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:03,510
got us.

148
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,720
But

149
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,720
this place

150
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,720
is

151
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,720
the Star

152
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,720
Crystal

153
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,720
’s

154
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,720
world,

155
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:07,720
ya know?

156
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:15,730
You

157
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:15,730
and your

158
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:15,730
magic

159
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,730
al

160
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,730
powers

161
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,730
are

162
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,730
from

163
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,730
now on

164
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,730
no

165
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,730
longer

166
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,730
usable

167
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,730
by

168
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,730
you

169
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:15,730
now.

170
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,410
Too

171
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,410
bad,

172
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:18,410
though.

173
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,250
Tel

174
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,250
Ma

175
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,250
Amoris!

176
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,040
Negi…

177
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,820
Oh, what is it, Chachamaru?

178
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,750
That.

179
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,930
Damn you…

180
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,670
She seems to have been hurt by what was said earlier.

181
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,130
Asuna, it’s cuz you said "even if she were on her DEATH BED," ya know!

182
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,210
“Incredibly impolite, incredibly heartless”…

183
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,260
I guess that was a bit too much…

184
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,750
What the hell, dammit!!

185
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,770
The Magic Academy…

186
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,410
Negi.

187
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,570
Anya.

188
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,950
Anya.

189
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:21,950
No!

190
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,220
You’re not Anya.

191
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,630
You are an illusion created by the Star Crystal!

192
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,020
What are you saying?

193
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,640
I’m the real thing.

194
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,640
No! You are not the Anya I know!

195
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,190
You’re a crybaby, as usual.

196
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,190
You were like that back then, too.

197
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,630
Remember? When you got lost in the woods…

198
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,620
Stop it!

199
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,010
When it got dark, you cried.

200
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,880
Stop it.

201
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,280
You didn’t stop crying, so I had to give you some candy.

202
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,010
You are not Anya!

203
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,720
You are not Anya.

204
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,190
Give me back Anya!

205
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,650
Did… Anya use that?

206
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,980
It’s a planetarium.

207
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,310
It seems we’ve been forgotten.

208
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,640
It’s been happening for a while now, ~mya.

209
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,840
Take a look, Negi.

210
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,570
The magical item that even the Thousand Master can’t use…

211
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,740
If I can use this…

212
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,840
What if I fail?

213
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,910
But… At this rate, I’ll lose!

214
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,720
For me to lose…

215
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,250
Anything but that!

216
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,290
I will beat Negi!

217
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,840
Anya went to take the Star Crystal for herself.

218
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,070
Why?

219
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,540
You wouldn’t understand.

220
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,490
You’re surrounded by friends.

221
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,240
You’ve never gotten hurt… you’ve never been betrayed…

222
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,260
Anya was lonely.

223
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:10,370
Anya wished for you to be hurt, to be sad.

224
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,050
Negi!

225
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,080
Stop it!

226
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,710
Please, just stop it!

227
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,080
What did Negi-sensei do to deserve this!?

228
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,820
That’s right! He didn’t do anything wrong!

229
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,580
It’s all because you hate him… and all because you blame him, isn’t it!?

230
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,530
Being resented in return can be a good thing!

231
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,660
That’s so cruel! Stop it!

232
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,150
Everyone…

233
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,080
That’s more like it.

234
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,570
Give back Anya.

235
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:59,010
Anya would never wish for me to be hurt.

236
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,130
Nor for me to be sad!

237
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,900
Your words are just made up by the Star Crystal!

238
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,520
What are you saying… ?

239
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,620
She would never do that.

240
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,790
She would never think of something so despicable.

241
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,010
And that’s because…

242
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:21,000
Anya loves me!

243
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,130
That’s my Anya!

244
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,250
Negi…

245
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,250
Please…

246
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,090
Bring back Anya!

247
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,550
Stop believing in people already.

248
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,010
People betray each other.

249
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,560
People hurt each other.

250
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,530
For their own sakes, people do things.

251
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,250
I believe!

252
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,290
You’re so soft-hearted.

253
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,160
Bring back Anya!

254
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,930
Negi!

255
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,550
Negi-sensei!

256
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,520
The Pactio Cards…

257
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,270
What… what’s happening?

258
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,260
It’s their hearts…

259
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,020
Negi-sensei!

260
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,300
You guys…

261
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,170
Come, Negi-sensei.

262
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,220
Use our powers!

263
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,320
Let’s save the real Anya from the Star Crystal!

264
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:11,930
Alright!

265
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,650
Give back Anya!

266
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,800
Ras

267
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,800
Tel

268
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,800
Ma

269
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,800
Scir

270
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,800
Magister!

271
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,120
Spirits of light and time…

272
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,120
The brilliance of the morning dew…

273
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,610
The silence of the fog of night…

274
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,560
Rise souls of the heart!

275
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,270
Hear my orders.

276
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,660
Come in this place, and tear apart the darkness!

277
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,630
Tel

278
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,630
Ma

279
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,630
Amoris!

280
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,660
Anya!

281
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,040
Negi…

282
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:20,780
Anya…

283
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,560
It’s alright now…

284
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,720
Come, let’s go.

285
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,060
Come.

286
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,580
That’s…

287
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,310
The timeless void.

288
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,120
Anya!!

289
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,500
They are getting sucked in!

290
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,200
Negi! Anya!

291
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,500
That’s the Star Crystal’s magic.

292
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,630
Looks like Negi-kun is not yet a match for…

293
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,620
Come on Aniki!

294
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,130
It’s no use… I can’t…

295
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,810
Anya!!

296
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,560
Let go of me! Save yourself!

297
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,940
What are you talking about!?

298
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,940
It’s my fault!

299
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,250
It’s all my fault!

300
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,270
Negi!!

301
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,540
No!

302
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,960
No way! I’ll never let go!

303
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:23,940
Negi…

304
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,810
Man, it’s no use!

305
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,340
What’s that?

306
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,730
That was…

307
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,670
Don’t tell me it’s…

308
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,670
Well, well… Looks like he somehow made it on time.

309
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,190
Honestly, in a good way.

310
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,770
Master is always late, ~mya.

311
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,430
Wah! What’s that?

312
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,330
Looks like the magic world is closing.

313
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,820
What’s going to happen to us after it closes?

314
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,500
I dunno.

315
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Don’t give me that crap!

316
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,200
Huh?

317
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,510
Father…

318
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,820
Huh? This place is…

319
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,940
Is it the magic world?

320
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,580
Nope. It’s the real world.

321
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,030
We’re back.

322
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,730
Anya…

323
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,570
Negi…

324
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:53,860
I…

325
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,880
Thank goodness…

326
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,210
Negi…

327
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,700
Really… thank goodness…

328
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,140
Thank you…

329
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,160
The Star Crystal is in here.

330
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,270
That person that saved us…

331
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,220
Ah. There must be a misunderstanding.

332
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,380
Looks like it, ~mya.

333
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:27,230
That person… Could it be…

334
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,360
Ahh! Look!

335
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,060
It’s beautiful!

336
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,840
That’s true…

337
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,350
It’s daybreak.

338
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:44,100
Somehow, all of that felt like a dream…

339
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:50,080
Konoka, why you… !

340
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,890
Asuna, if you wanna do it, then go ahead…

341
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,430
Why would I want to!?

342
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,940
Come on, don’t be shy.

343
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,720
Hey! What are you doing?

344
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,440
Saying “No! No!” is part of love.

345
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,000
That’s not right!!

346
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,950
Stop saying silly things already…

347
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,990
Oh, Asuna…

348
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,010
And so! The Case of the Star Crystal has been solved!

349
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,850
Who was that who saved them at the last moment?

350
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,510
Looks like it’s…

351
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,420
Well, I wonder about that…

352
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:23,500
Well, thank goodness for Negi! And see you next time!

353
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:05,120
The Baka Rangers are now undergoing modification surgery by Doctor Hakase to become modded humans!

354
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:11,600
Now with the instincts of the great animals, you will become an unbeatable fighting force!

355
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,490
Come, open your eyes, Baka Rangers!

356
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,950
Red Boar!

357
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:21,070
The reckless—Baka Red!

358
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,000
Black Owl!

359
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,260
One with the night—Baka Black!

360
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,110
Blue Kappa!

361
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,220
RUMBAPPA! Baka Blue!

362
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,050
Yellow Tiger!

363
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:36,600
Running in circles—Baka Yellow!

364
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,280
And… Pink Monkey!

365
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,080
Eh?

366
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,470
Mamma?

367
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,930
Ookie!
