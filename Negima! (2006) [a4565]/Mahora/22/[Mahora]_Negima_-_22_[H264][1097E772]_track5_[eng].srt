1
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,950
Master, there is no electricity.

2
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,880
Oh… Really…

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,780
If I do not recharge, I am unable to fly.

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,580
Oh… Really…

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,650
Does your stomach still hurt?

6
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,440
I’m sleeping because it hurts! Stupid.

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,420
The World Ramen Delicacy… What a fearsome thing.

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,950
Wow! That was pretty good!

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,340
Takamichi… This time I will really kill you.

10
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,940
By Lingshen.

11
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,430
What is this!?

12
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,310
What?

13
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,300
What’s wrong?

14
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,230
This is probably a radish...

15
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,640
and maybe a carrot…

16
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,100
Whaddya think?

17
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,130
The carrot wins?

18
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,980
Err… I don’t think that’s it.

19
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,790
Hm… Why don’t we try recovering all the scraps?

20
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,640
Hakase, I think it would be faster if we just made a new one.

21
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,020
Yeah. I guess we’ll do that then.

22
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,460
Anyway, I’ve got an idea.

23
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,540
Oh, what kind of idea?

24
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,360
I’ll explain it to you in a little while.

25
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,450
Come over here.

26
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,850
What in the world is the meaning of this?

27
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,750
It's really weird, isn't it?

28
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:12,960
Yeah.

29
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,620
There might be something going on.

30
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,200
What do they all have in common?

31
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,110
Figures; the prank's becoming way too long.

32
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,590
But wow, these veggies look pretty gross, don't they?

33
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,010
But when you’re hungry, they're really good!

34
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,520
Such a slow and stupid girl.

35
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,520
We haven’t washed that you know.

36
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,190
That’s no good, Ane-san.

37
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,060
The rat said I’m no good!

38
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,580
Hey, Makie-san!

39
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,810
I’m not a rat! I’m an ermine!

40
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,320
Owwie...

41
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,390
Hakase-san, Lingshen-san!

42
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,470
What's wrong?

43
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,410
Everyone! Please get out of here!

44
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,700
Mechacabra!

45
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,860
Version 2!

46
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,860
Didn’t it get destroyed?

47
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,710
Well, it suddenly moved on its own!

48
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,650
Even when the insides are empty!

49
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,800
Not even my kung-fu was good enough!

50
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,420
Aniki, that’s…

51
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,060
Yeah.

52
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,050
It’s possessed by the darkness!

53
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,390
Here it comes! The prank!

54
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,420
Ah, could it be that…?

55
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,070
Spiiiinny, spinny, spinny, spinny...

56
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,680
Everyone, please stay back!

57
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,540
Negi-bouzu! I want more power!

58
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,290
Lingshen-san...

59
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,810
Alright then.

60
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,270
Partner: Chao Lingshen.

61
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,540
Show me the power within you!

62
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,240
Contract,

63
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:57,730
Activate!!

64
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,200
Alright!! It’s an armor card!!

65
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,660
Go Lingshen!

66
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,660
Fight-o!

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,200
Now's your chance!

68
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,190
Now, Lingshen!

69
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,340
Go get 'em!

70
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,330
Alright!

71
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,590
Lingshen-san!

72
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,820
I call it the Giacobini Meteor Punch!

73
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,540
So moe!

74
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,070
Flamey, flamey, flamey...

75
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,170
Looks like the Darkness is on the move again, Aniki.

76
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,190
Yeah. Let’s go talk to Takamichi about this.

77
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,180
Sensei.

78
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,040
I’ve solved the mystery.

79
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,550
Alright. Now the trap is complete, de gozaru.

80
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,340
Yay! It’s done!

81
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:28,880
Desu!

82
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,020
All we have to do is wait for the Bonge Bonge to come right?

83
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,340
I wonder if it'll show up or not...

84
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,950
We will lure it out!

85
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:36,610
With this!

86
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,730
Chupa Tee?

87
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,810
Does the Bonge Bonge like the Chupa Tee, de gozaru?

88
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,390
What are you saying?

89
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,820
He-llo, it's ONLY obvious that everyone loves a Chupa Tee, right?

90
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,340
It's obvious?

91
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,570
By the way, I’ve been thinking about this for a while.

92
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,950
Why do we have to catch the Bonge Bonge?

93
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,210
Ah, now that you mention it...

94
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,150
Hmm, I hadn't thought of that.

95
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,070
Asuna,

96
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,340
why do we have to?

97
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,040
Eh? Well, let's see... That's right...

98
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,890
For whatever reason, I guess.

99
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,590
Don’t ask a question you don’t know the answer to.

100
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,090
Oh well, that’s alright.

101
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,370
Come on everyone, hide!

102
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,310
The Bonge Bonge is coming! Quickly, quickly!

103
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,000
What the?

104
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,280
It’s here already!?

105
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,480
The Bonge Bonge?

106
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,310
No. From the size, it doesn’t look like it, de gozaru.

107
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:29,870
Stand back.

108
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,960
It’s the mechacabra desu!

109
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,000
It's wearing the Chupa Tee!

110
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,470
See? Everyone loves it!

111
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,380
Now's not the time for that!

112
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,880
Why is the mechacabra here!?

113
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,610
Is someone inside?

114
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,050
Ah, I bet it's Negi!

115
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,300
You annoying brat wanted to surprise us, right!?

116
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:53,940
I don't think that's it.

117
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,360
That is not Negi-sensei.

118
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,560
That mechacabra has a killing intent.

119
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,690
The solution is in the zodiac?

120
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,210
That’s right.

121
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,270
Alright,

122
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,240
The first ones to be possessed were Yuuna-san,

123
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,330
Kaede-san,

124
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,800
and Chiu-Chiu-chan.

125
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,290
These 3 are all Sagittarius.

126
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,400
Wait a minute! I'm not a Sagittarius; I was born on February 2. That's Aquarius!

127
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,240
I’m on June 1st, so I’m Gemini.

128
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,020
But those are based on the Solar Zodiac, right?

129
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,450
I’m talking about the Lunar Zodiac.

130
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:34,960
The Lunar Zodiac?

131
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,750
I’ve never heard of it.

132
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,230
Aniki, know anything about it?

133
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,290
Yeah. Onee-chan said something about it once before.

134
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:47,490
In astrology, all the stars including the sun exist in the zodiac.

135
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:55,090
That’s right. In other words, in lunar astrology, Yuuna-san and Chiu-Chiu-chan are also Sagittarius.

136
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,860
Wait! Stop calling me "Chiu-Chiu"!

137
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,740
Stop breaking into a sweat about it, Ane-san!

138
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,550
I see. This is very interesting.

139
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,330
Please continue your story, Chizuru-san.

140
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,010
Okay.

141
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,000
The next ones to be possessed are Makie-san, Mana-san, Ayaka and Natsumi.

142
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,050
These four are Pisces.

143
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,200
So I am Pisces, eh…

144
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,130
By the way, where’s Maki-chan?

145
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:22,990
Over there.

146
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,440
Moving on...

147
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,150
The next ones are Ako-san, Sakurako-san, and Satsuki-san.

148
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,950
These three are Aries.

149
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,250
I see.

150
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,000
Then it’s definitely related to the Lunar Zodiac!

151
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,120
If that’s the case, then what is behind all this, Chizuru-san?

152
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:44,950
Divination.

153
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,820
Exactly. The one who possessed the girls is very well versed in astrology.

154
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:52,360
What about it?

155
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:58,410
We know now the possessor is well versed in Divination. Can we solve this problem?

156
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,870
Well, I don’t know about that.

157
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,020
What do you mean you don’t know?

158
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,930
So all you did was solve the mystery, Ane-san?

159
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,850
Yeah! But hey,

160
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,170
Knowing this makes things just a tad less mysterious, huh?

161
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,570
True, that it does, but…

162
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,780
The question to what is going on still remains, right? Aniki?

163
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,900
Aniki?

164
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,110
What is the matter, Negi-sensei?

165
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,520
You don’t look too good.

166
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,060
Do you need to go to the infirmary?

167
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,700
Divination.

168
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,650
Ne

169
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,650
gi

170
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,650
ma!

171
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,460
Go!

172
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,460
Go!

173
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,460
Let's Go!

174
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,970
Ne

175
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,970
gi

176
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,970
ma!

177
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,690
So moe-moe, aru!

178
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,080
Negima Negimi Negimu Negime Negimo…

179
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,640
Negima Negimi Neg-… ugh…

180
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,490
Out.

181
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:43,490
Oh!

182
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,790
Another unnatural phenomenon attacks Class A.

183
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,700
Alright! The base flavoring is ready!

184
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,320
Yay! Let’s cook it!

185
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,930
The magical world strikes again!

186
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,110
The book-!

187
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,840
This is one book-blown pinch!

188
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,670
15 points.

189
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,180
Spicy, isn't it?

190
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,890
Nah, more of a mild flavor.

191
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,480
This isn't the time for that!

192
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,830
This is a problem of encyclopedic proportions! Meanwhile, the culprits are here!

193
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,490
Looks like that time has come, mya.

194
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,350
Seems like it.

195
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,040
Let’s begin communications.

196
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,100
CQ, CQ, BBQ

197
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,810
If you're barbequing, coat it with sauce, then grill, turn it over, and grill again.

198
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,410
Be serious.

199
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,530
Oh, I’m sorry.

200
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:43,860
If you go out with Year 3 Class A, you will become popular! In a good way.

201
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,710
There is no such character as Class A, mya.

202
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,840
Well, cut it out and start the communications, mya.

203
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:56,000
CQ, limited express, exclusively limited express; The Line 2 High Speed Train has already passed.

204
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,810
Please step back into the area between the white lines while you wait. Tha….

205
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,890
CQ, CQ, this is Motsu.

206
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,660
So we'll finally get to see its presence?

207
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,190
Alright! Time to transform!

208
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:13,840
Black Rose.

209
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,140
Pork Bone Magic?

210
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:22,490
Yeah. I found some really old magic.

211
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,650
What is it and what is it for?

212
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,140
The source of the magical powers.

213
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,430
In other words, I'm learning about the master of the magic that was released.

214
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,820
However, since it’s very old magic, there isn’t a precise method to activate it.

215
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,420
That’s why I’m trying out various ways to do it.

216
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,760
Then, the ramen research has no particular purpose?

217
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:43,870
You could say that.

218
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,730
In any case, Chachamaru-kun…

219
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,470
Yes.

220
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,250
Why are you all soaked up?

221
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,840
I cannot fly so I swam here.

222
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,660
Ah. I see.

223
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,110
Oh! It’s out!

224
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,440
This might actually work!

225
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,740
Oh. Looks like something is happening.

226
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,860
Awesome!

227
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,690
Pork Bone Magic is successful!

228
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,780
Is this person the owner of all the magical power?

229
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,690
So that’s how it is…

230
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,200
Nekane-san?

231
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,920
Yeah. Have you seen Nekane onee-chan?

232
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,470
Ah. Nekane-san…

233
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,340
…went upstairs just now.

234
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,460
Upstairs…

235
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,000
Thank you very much!

236
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,380
Wait for me!

237
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,380
Aniki, why are we looking for Nekane nee-san?

238
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,640
Motsu-kun, Shichimi-kun.

239
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:45,240
You really aren't sent from the Magic Academy.

240
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,320
Who was that transmission addressed to?

241
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,090
Well, that er...

242
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,980
Is it the Master of the Darkness?

243
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,190
The Master of the Darkness?

244
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,780
You are also born from that which stole the Star Crystal.

245
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,360
The Shriek of the Soul.

246
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,350
You are the fragment fairies, aren't you?

247
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,560
The… Shriek of the Soul?

248
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,630
Dunno...

249
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,780
Stop playing innocent!

250
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,910
Now, turn into Fragments!

251
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,800
Sleeping light, beyond the door of journeys.

252
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,420
To the other side of the mist!

253
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,480
Was I mistaken?

254
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,480
Too bad…

255
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,910
You missed.

256
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,000
No!

257
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,550
We aren't the monstrous things you've mentioned to us.

258
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,470
Desu mya~.

259
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,040
Then who did you call just now?

260
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:48,600
Oh. That was a different. It was a PRIVATE matter. In a good way.

261
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,280
Then you guys and the Star Crystal…

262
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,710
As a matter of fact...

263
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
...we've got nothing to do with it, mya.

264
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,180
Sorry to disappoint you.

265
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,880
Don't get your knickers in a bunch about it, mya.

266
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,100
Just when I thought I got it figured out...

267
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,070
Black Rose Baron!

268
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,560
Come on, don’t step on me!

269
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,220
Geez... ow ow ow... Oh?

270
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,950
Takahata-sensei?

271
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,210
Baron. There is a question I want to ask you.

272
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,180
A question?

273
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,070
The person who stole the Star Crystal… you know that person, right?

274
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,380
What are you trying to say?

275
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,010
The culprit that I'm looking for,

276
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,690
the Master of the Darkness, is someone I know, isn't it?

277
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,800
The people in Class A who were possessed by the Darkness were targeted according to their Lunar Zodiac signs.

278
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,280
In other words, the person who stole the Star Crystal and the Master of the Darkness,

279
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:51,780
is one who is knowledgeable in divination. And the only person I know that specializes in divination is...

280
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,020
Anya.

281
00:15:58,810 --> 00:15:59,460
What did you say!?

282
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,630
Is that true, Aniki!?

283
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,580
The worlds that were spawned by the Darkness…

284
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,910
…were all places from my memory.

285
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,870
They're all places where I played with Anya.

286
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,650
Negi-kun. You're wrong.

287
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,170
They are not the same as your memories.

288
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,160
Baron!

289
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,920
Is that enough, Nekane-kun?

290
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,070
Takamichi…

291
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,710
I have ascertained it.

292
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,060
The source of the Darkness is Anya.

293
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,300
Anya?

294
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,060
Takamichi, is that true?

295
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,060
Yes. No mistake about it.

296
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,520
You don’t look too surprised, Negi.

297
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,020
Did you know already?

298
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,590
I’m sorry.

299
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:53,760
It’s okay.

300
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,890
You already knew the Master of Darkness was Anya,

301
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,080
and disguised yourself as the Black Rose Baron

302
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,960
to try and secretly protect Negi-kun.

303
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,230
You could have notified the Magic Academy.

304
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,770
Why did you do it alone?

305
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,160
If I did that, then Anya would be punished.

306
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:17,020
But Anya stole the Star Crystal, and is targeting Negi.

307
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:25,560
If we discovered all the Fragment Fairies and completed the Shriek of the Soul, the Anya within the Star Crystal would awaken.

308
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,950
If I did that, I figured I could talk to Anya.

309
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,970
To try to convince her?

310
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,910
Nekane-kun, that is impossible.

311
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,430
Impossible or not, if we don’t try…

312
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:43,580
Even if you say so, the Star Crystal has incredible magical power.

313
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,220
Can you really do it?

314
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,640
It’s a shame, but you don’t have the kind of power to stand up to it.

315
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,740
Of course, I don’t either.

316
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,790
Onee-chan.

317
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,820
Why did Anya steal the Star Crystal?

318
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,690
Why me?

319
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,420
Tell us, Nekane-kun.

320
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,550
Anya is lonely, that’s why.

321
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,910
The fortune-telling job didn’t go as well as planned.

322
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,310
She couldn’t socialize with the others on the stage either.

323
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,000
Even though she's strong-willed, she's still a child.

324
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,110
I think it was hard on her.

325
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:25,810
Anya…

326
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,110
Anya always had you in mind, Negi.

327
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,280
She always said, “I don’t want to lose to Negi!”

328
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,870
Despite that, I told her you were doing well.

329
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,000
I said you made a lot of friends.

330
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,020
I'd keep talking about you.

331
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,980
I should have realized earlier.

332
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,980
But Anya…

333
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,330
She held on to “I don’t want to lose to Negi”...

334
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,850
And made a move on the Star Crystal.

335
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,240
It’s my fault.

336
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,430
If I didn’t say such unnecessary things…

337
00:18:58,890 --> 00:18:59,930
None of this would…

338
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,510
I knew that I had to do something.

339
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,960
I wanted to try and save Anya.

340
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,070
Onee-chan!

341
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,190
Bonge Bonge!?

342
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,510
Catherine.

343
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:17,750
That voice…

344
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,400
Is that a fairy from the Darkness!?

345
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,200
Negi!

346
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,100
Negi!

347
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:29,060
Sleeping light, beyond the door of journeys!

348
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,550
To the other side of the mist!

349
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,140
Tel

350
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,140
Ma

351
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,140
Amoris!

352
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,220
It combined into one!

353
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,220
That’s the Shriek of the Soul!

354
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,990
The Star Crystal.

355
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:13,990
Master.

356
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,040
She is possessed by the darkness!

357
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:46,620
Eva-san!

358
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,650
Negi, it’s me.

359
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:53,210
Anya!

360
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,130
I will not lose!

361
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,390
I will not lose to you!

362
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,390
Never…

363
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:00,640
Anya…

364
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,840
And so, the enemy awakens!

365
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,770
It’s Negi’s childhood friend Anya!

366
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,280
Anya is going after Negi!

367
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,740
What will you do, Negi?!

368
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,090
Will you fight, Negi?!

369
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:14,700
Will he win?! We'll find out next time!

370
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,340
Let's go!

371
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:48,260
Having a fighting spirit is important to an athlete!

372
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,990
That's probably why Yuuna's so drawn to military things!

373
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,300
I see.

374
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:57,420
Next time, “Hold on, that’s not what I meant Negi-kun!” by Yuuna

375
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,320
“That’s right! I’m your partner after all!” by Ako.

376
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,920
Alright. Give me your arm.

377
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,990
Eh!? You're going to inject me with that?

378
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,530
It’s okay, with these nutrients, you can fight for 24 hours straight!

379
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,110
No… That’s not…

380
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,560
Chamo-kun, what is your full name?

381
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,610
Albert Chamomile...

382
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,590
Sounds, uh... interesting.

383
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,630
What about yours, Motsu?

384
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:26,830
Motsui Hideki.

385
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,320
The Major Leaguer?

386
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,970
Please call me “Gorilla Motsui”.

387
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:33,330
Monkey!
