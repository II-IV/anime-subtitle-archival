Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.04,0:04:12.36,N_Tak,Takamichi,0000,0000,0000,,So, Nekane-san's true identity being revealed must have been a miscalculation.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.40,0:04:18.41,N_Eva,Eva,0000,0000,0000,,But since she's discovered, there's no way for her to deceive anymore.

Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.03,0:04:26.87,N_Tak,Takamichi,0000,0000,0000,,I think not doing anything would be better.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.29,0:04:30.75,N_Eva,Eva,0000,0000,0000,,When it is time to reveal everything, Nekane will reveal it herself.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.10,0:04:34.41,N_Tak,Takamichi,0000,0000,0000,,I think that whatever it is that Nekane-kun isn't telling us,
