1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,000
I have a memory that I have concealed.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,470
No, it was actually something I didn't realize I had concealed.

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,150
I found it!

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,480
It's a book on magic!

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,530
This corner is the magic books section, huh?

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:24,040
But is this really the best way to find it?

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,110
We have no choice but to go through everything.

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,880
Yeah, we have to work hard to find a way to get everyone back home.

9
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,430
We need to do it for our beloved Negi-kun as well!

10
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,000
Right?

11
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:40,960
No, it might be that it was a feeling that I didn't realize before.

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,920
And it's probably because I didn't want to admit to it.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,580
You should move up further Yue; you can get more of the books that way.

14
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,180
And that feeling was...

15
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:53,990
Yue?!

16
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,910
Are you all right, Yue-san?

17
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,130
Negi-sensei.

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,980
There was an emotion that affected Yue's heart. That was...

19
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,480
By Takahata.

20
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,030
By Chamo.

21
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,770
Master, Master.

22
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,980
Let me sleep a bit longer, Chachamaru.

23
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,780
I'm exhausted...

24
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,800
We have a problem, master. Please wake up.

25
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,380
What is the meaning of this, Chachamaru?!

26
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,650
It was already like this by the time my system turned on.

27
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,850
We've been transported to the magic world.

28
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,460
To be brought all the way here, that bastard Takamichi...

29
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,630
Let's go, Chachamaru!

30
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,170
La Lac Spiritus!

31
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:35,670
La Lac Spiritus!

32
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,520
La Lac Spiritus!

33
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,900
That can't be done, master.

34
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:49,750
Due to your condition you have yet to fully recover your magic powers, Master.

35
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,390
Magic can't be used.

36
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,660
It can't be helped.

37
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,290
Chachamaru, I'll stay. You fly out of here.

38
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,320
I deeply apologize.

39
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,390
I forgot to recharge. I won't be able to fly for today.

40
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,370
So you are telling me...

41
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,220
That we're stuck here for now?

42
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,630
Affirmative.

43
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,410
5 points.

44
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,550
I didn't say anything?

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,510
Maybe it's my imagination.

46
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:20,990
I have this feeling I should go rescue a survivor... or something.

47
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,400
Is that so?

48
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,820
5 points.

49
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,520
The trial is next Wednesday, isn't it?

50
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,580
We need to do our best.

51
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,020
Ah, what a relief!

52
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,520
It was good that Negi-kun was there in time to save you.

53
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,420
I'm actually ashamed of that.

54
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,980
Let's hurry home and read through this material.

55
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,020
Okay!

56
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,840
What's wrong, Yue?

57
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,360
Looks like I hurt my arm earlier.

58
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,650
Are you all right, Yue-Yue?

59
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,130
I'll be fine- this is nothing.

60
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,300
Let me carry it for you.

61
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,470
Negi-sensei...

62
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,510
You shouldn't push yourself.

63
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,070
When we get back, why don't you have Ako-san look at it?

64
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,660
Ah, okay...

65
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,180
Yue, do you like him?

66
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,750
Eh? N-No, it's not that I like him...

67
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,180
It's just that... well...

68
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,020
But you've been like that lately, haven't you?

69
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,750
Ah.

70
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,790
What kind of juice is that?

71
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,590
This is "karei" flavored.

72
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,300
Curry juice?

73
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,350
Jou-chan, lemme take a sip of that.

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,380
What does it taste like, Chamo-kun?

75
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,580
I can't quite explain it...

76
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,590
You want to give it a try, Aniki?

77
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,150
Okay...

78
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,570
What is this flavor?

79
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,960
I recognize the taste, but I can't recall the name...

80
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,820
For curry, it doesn't taste spicy at all.

81
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,320
You've got it all wrong.

82
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,650
I didn't say "kare-" as in "curry".

83
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,740
I meant "karei," as in "flounder".

84
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,410
Huh?!

85
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,730
Japanese culture is amazing!

86
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,840
They even have fish juice?

87
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,410
I don't think it's even part of Japanese culture.

88
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,390
Well, shall we get going?

89
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,270
Alright!

90
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,630
Negi-sensei...

91
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,300
You're head-over-heels.

92
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,420
Right now you are in love.

93
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,480
Your eyes are different when you look at Negi-chan, mya!

94
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,700
T-That's not it!

95
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,060
I don't have any particular feelings towards Negi-sensei...

96
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,060
Oh hey, that straw...

97
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,490
... is an indirect kiss with Negi-san.

98
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,150
I-I-Indirect kiss?!

99
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:36,330
You could call an indirect kiss a smooch on the elbow or on the knee.

100
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,490
Indirect... kiss.

101
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,480
It's nothing you should be embarrassed about, mya.

102
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,800
Didn't you have a flat-out direct kiss with him when you made a provisional contract with him?

103
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,830
I-I-I had no choice when that happened!

104
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,630
Besides I wasn't the only one; everyone else in class did it, too!

105
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,320
Nope, you're wrong.

106
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,830
The one that the class kissed was not Negi-san, but a Chupacabra.

107
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,440
But when he was in human form, you personally kissed him yourself.

108
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,550
In fact, you were the last person to kiss him when he was in his human form.

109
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,450
In a good way!

110
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,300
In a good way!?

111
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,540
From that time on, and above all else,

112
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,750
You've been...

113
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,590
In love with...

114
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,000
Negi-san!

115
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,810
In a good way…?

116
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,420
Just like this...

117
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,800
Love Jui...

118
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,720
How do I feel about Negi-sensei... ?

119
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,200
Check it out! I got a ton!

120
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,210
Why don't we do sukiyaki tonight?

121
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,640
Yuuna, you really like green onions don't you?

122
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,850
Like green onions!?

123
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,770
Hey, don't you think it’s a bit chilly today?

124
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,480
You're right. Maybe I should wear some more layers?

125
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,870
Wear more layers... !!

126
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,610
Chizu-nee, what are you listening to?

127
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,050
Tchaikovsky.

128
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,450
It's a recording by the New York Philaharmonic Orchestra in Carnegie Hall.

129
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,990
CarNEGIe Hall?!

130
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,350
I can't say it.

131
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,550
I get nervous whenever I hear anything related to Negi-sensei.

132
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,440
Let's try this one out!

133
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,920
Minamoto no Yoshitsune...

134
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,460
Night on the Galactic Railroad.

135
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,570
What was all that about?

136
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,160
Minamoto no Yoshitsu<b>NE-

137
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,290
<b>GI</b>nga tetsudou no yoru!

138
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,020
Ah, geez! Desu!

139
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,840
Ah, geez! Desu!

140
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,110
Huh?

141
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,440
Geez! Geez!

142
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,730
I've finally calmed down...

143
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,280
Negi-sensei...

144
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,010
Why am I hiding like this?

145
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,540
It's not like I'm going to do anything bad.

146
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,720
A four-leaf clover?

147
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,010
There was something about this in the materials I read last time.

148
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,010
According to the legend, with this you are able to evade tricks from evil fairies.

149
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,810
Oh! This would be perfect to give to Negi-sensei to protect him from evil fairies or other creatures.

150
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,040
What should I do?

151
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,610
My heart is pounding like crazy.

152
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,790
Negi!

153
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:24,410
Asuna-san!

154
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,390
Where did you go?

155
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,380
Today you promised you were going to help us capture the Bonge Bonge didn't you?

156
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,680
Huh? I did?

157
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,160
Geez, you forgot!

158
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,790
Asuna, when you say that, aren't you just volunteering people to help without asking?

159
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,910
But still, if he didn't refuse, isn't it the same as promising to do so?

160
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,140
Another heavy-handed move, huh.

161
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,090
And I was looking all over for you, too.

162
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,770
We thought you got caught up in something bad, so we were worried.

163
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,690
I'm sorry!

164
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,360
It's okay now, you two...

165
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,210
because we're all alive and kickin'!

166
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,700
Right, Negi-kun?

167
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,980
Here! This protective charm is for you, Negi-sensei!

168
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,450
Thank you very much, Yue-san.

169
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,550
I-I can't do something like that!

170
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,810
Give us a hand when you're done with lunch, alright?

171
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,720
Sure, okay.

172
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,610
Negi-sensei is alone now.

173
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,450
This is my chance!

174
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,460
But, what should I say if I want to give it to him?

175
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,930
Negi-sensei!

176
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,990
While we were out walking around, we came across some beautiful flowers, de gozaru.

177
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,700
Don't you think they're cute?

178
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,900
We brought this for you, sensei!

179
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,900
Ah! Thank you very much!

180
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,190
That's it!

181
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,950
I can give it to him if I do it that way!

182
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,780
Negi-sensei!

183
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,160
I made a fresh batch of steamed buns!

184
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,740
Would you like to try one?

185
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,450
Wow, that looks good!

186
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,830
Don't be shy; help yourself!

187
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,580
That's where you were, Negi-bozu.

188
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,040
Why don't you help me with some techniques, aru?

189
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,390
Wah! W-Wait a minute, Kuu Fei-san... !

190
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,960
Negi-sensei!

191
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,730
We made ourselves a new cheerleading uniform!

192
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,510
Look, look! Isn't it cute?

193
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,020
What do you think, Negi-kun?

194
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,230
You all look wonderful!

195
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,560
Yay!

196
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,240
Negi-kun's rather popular isn't he?

197
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:26,200
It gets pretty hard when you've got so many rivals.

198
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,120
Calling them "rivals" is kind of...

199
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,040
Really, it's none of my business if people want to be friendly...

200
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,460
with Negi-sensei...

201
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,270
What are you saying? That's pretty heartless.

202
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,760
It'd be mean if we didn't cheer Nodoka on, right?

203
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,790
Since Negi-kun is so popular, it puts Nodoka in a bit of a pinch.

204
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,530
I guess...

205
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,770
That's right...

206
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,710
Nodoka's got her eyes set on Negi-sensei.

207
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,480
Nodoka is my best friend.

208
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,380
That's why I...

209
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,820
shouldn't be falling for Negi-sensei...

210
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,830
Ah! It's a ramen place!

211
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,750
Ah, I'm hungry.

212
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,360
But I don't have any money.

213
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,950
Daddy!

214
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,910
Treat me to ramen!

215
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,320
I really wanna eat with Daddy!

216
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,140
Oh, that makes me feel warm and fuzzy.

217
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,690
Okay! I'll get whatever you want.

218
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,230
Hey, welcome!

219
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,680
2 bowls of ramen.

220
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,640
This is a nice place you got.

221
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,280
Okay! Coming right up!

222
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,290
It's really good.

223
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,050
He says it's good.

224
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,120
How's school been for you?

225
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,030
Been able to make friends?

226
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,030
Yeah!

227
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,600
Really? If you get bullied, let Daddy know right away.

228
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,080
Yup! Thank you, Daddy!

229
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:58,750
Here ya go!

230
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,860
Wow, this looks good!

231
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,410
Itadakimasu!

232
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,220
I'm so hungry...

233
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,920
Master, would you like one?

234
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,310
Don't give me that crap!

235
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,320
Shobon.

236
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,340
Shakii.

237
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:23,860
Shobon.

238
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:26,580
Shakii.

239
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,030
Shobon.

240
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,930
Shakii.

241
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:31,730
Shobon.

242
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,640
Shakii.

243
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,540
Shobon.

244
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,120
Shakii.

245
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,790
You're rather interesting aren't you.

246
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,280
Much obliged.

247
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,920
Excellent work.

248
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,680
Now then, one more.

249
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,010
This isn't cormorant fishing!

250
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:58,510
This is the set of profiles the bad guys had.

251
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,720
If we can find something similar between them,

252
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,240
we can figure out why they are after these girls.

253
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,810
Kaede-san was first, right?

254
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,480
Then Yuuna-san, right?

255
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,780
Then Chiu-Chiu-san, right?

256
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,820
Don't call me Chiu-Chiu!

257
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,190
I just did an analysis and other than being in the same year,

258
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,040
there's no real connection between everyone.

259
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,410
I got it!

260
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,090
The names fit together like shiritori.

261
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,780
Shiritori?

262
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,190
Well, here take a look at it.

263
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,310
Ma"na",

264
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:33,300
"Na"tsu"mi",

265
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,810
"Mi"yaki"e",

266
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:36,400
"E"incho

267
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,520
See? It's a riddle!

268
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,910
How is it one?!

269
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,240
Besides, my name isn't even Eincho.

270
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,840
Since its in England, it's in English...

271
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,530
How about angel?

272
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,720
It's Yukihiro Ayaka.

273
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,520
There isn't a word like Eincho in English anyway.

274
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,530
Neither is Miyakie.

275
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,920
That's right.

276
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,820
At least Natsumi should be swapped with Makie.

277
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,460
Ah, it's a text from Chizu-nee.

278
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,760
Huh?

279
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,110
Natsuma?!

280
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,010
Hey, that's cute.

281
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,180
Murakami Natsuma.

282
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,580
That isn't cute at all!

283
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,460
Nodoka is my best friend.

284
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,610
Nodoka likes Negi-sensei.

285
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:29,960
So I probably just like him because Nodoka likes him as well.

286
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,780
That's probably it.

287
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,570
It's a bit tough to read through all this, huh.

288
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,370
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry Yue-Yue.

289
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,960
I zoned out, so I missed that.

290
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,870
What'd you say?

291
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,170
Oh, it's nothing.

292
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:50,630
Besides, I don't exactly have a reason to like him like Nodoka does.

293
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,110
Nodoka.

294
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,880
Yes, Yue-Yue?

295
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,140
Umm, well...

296
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,560
Nodoka, why is it that you like Negi-sensei?

297
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,430
Eh? "W-why," you say?

298
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:08,360
Negi-sensei is cute, honest, smart, and he can use magic.

299
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,340
Even though I'm older than him, he is so mature and, and...

300
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,280
But...

301
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:14,950
But?

302
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,150
You don't need a reason.

303
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,080
Eh?

304
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,840
If there is someone that you like,

305
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,090
I don't think you need to have a reason to like them.

306
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,720
My gosh...

307
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:31,160
Even without a reason, I do like Negi-sensei.

308
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,680
That isn't right.

309
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,220
Something like that isn't right.

310
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:40,460
Wouldn't that mean that it would be fine for me to like Negi-sensei as well?

311
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,960
Yue-Yue, what's wrong?

312
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,770
Oh, it's nothing.

313
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:49,630
You've been acting weird lately. Is there something bothering you?

314
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,040
It's nothing!

315
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,950
Yue-Yue, we're best friends, right?

316
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,620
We can talk about anything. You know I'm always here for you.

317
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,250
Leave me alone.

318
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:02,660
Eh?

319
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,180
This has nothing to do with you, Nodoka.

320
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,040
Leave me alone!

321
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,870
Yue-Yue... I'm sorry...

322
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,890
Wait!

323
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,680
Why am I such an idiot?

324
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,640
I didn't want to hurt my best friend, but still I... I...

325
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,260
Yue!

326
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,550
The patient is a 15 year-old girl.

327
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,310
She was found collapsed in a corridor.

328
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,460
Vitals are 54, 31.

329
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,140
Pulse...

330
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,390
is now 20!

331
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,440
We'll need to take a blood count, analyze her biochemistry, blood agents, and urinalysis.

332
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,100
After that, I need a CT on her abdomen and all directional photographs of her cervical vertebrae.

333
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,810
Sen... sei...

334
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,460
Exactly what happened?

335
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:53,840
World...

336
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,920
delicacies...

337
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:55,680
-noodles.

338
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,760
The other patient is showing the same abnormalities.

339
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,240
Umm...

340
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,010
how are my vitals?

341
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,130
He's dead.

342
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,040
What is the matter?

343
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,060
Nekane-san...

344
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,690
Something troubling you?

345
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,150
It's not something you can tell someone, is it?

346
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,240
That's painful to deal with.

347
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:26,650
It's even more painful when it’s a secret you can't even share with someone important to you.

348
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,420
Nekane-san, do you have a painful secret that you keep inside you as well?

349
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,020
Yes.

350
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,850
I wonder if you would be able to understand my pain.

351
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,430
"The king has donkey ears."

352
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,440
What?

353
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,230
In that story, in the end everyone laughed.

354
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,670
But if no one laughed,

355
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,790
if you yelled out loud, wouldn't that be refreshing?

356
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,530
Why don't you give it a shot?

357
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,390
Don't worry.

358
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,530
No one will hear you from here.

359
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:03,810
But...

360
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,540
I won't listen.

361
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,170
You see,

362
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,320
I come here sometimes to shout.

363
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,090
Really?

364
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,540
It's very refreshing.

365
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,080
I...

366
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,680
... I...

367
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,720
... I

368
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,500
I'm sorry, Nodoka.

369
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,300
I... like Negi-sensei!

370
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,860
I like him!

371
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,610
I love him!

372
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,520
I really like him!

373
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,260
Love, love, love!

374
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,730
I really love Negi-sensei!

375
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,980
No matter what anyone says, I love him!

376
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,560
I really love Negi-sensei!

377
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:14,930
Master...

378
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,580
The batteries have been recharged.

379
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,430
Really?!

380
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,500
I'm not fully recharged, so I cannot take you with me.

381
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,640
However, I will go seek help.

382
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,760
No other way, I guess.

383
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,900
Proceed.

384
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,280
Yes, master.

385
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,730
Nodoka.

386
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,900
I'm sorry about what happened earlier.

387
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,210
Umm... Well... That is...

388
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,770
There are times when I am in a bad mood.

389
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,340
Yue-Yue...

390
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,370
Just kidding!

391
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,060
Ah, that reminds me.

392
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,930
Is that a four-leaf clover?

393
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,360
Supposedly this makes you immune to fairy trickery.

394
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,480
Nodoka, give this to Negi-sensei.

395
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,580
For me to give... to Negi-sensei?

396
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,340
It should increase the good feelings between you two.

397
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,580
From now on, that memory will be kept hidden.

398
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,180
This pure memory is a...

399
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:20,910
Se-cr-et.

400
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:21,530
Se-cr-et.

401
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,250
Se-cr-et.

402
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,000
On the other hand, we continue on with the attempts to halt the situation in the magic world.

403
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,970
Well then, what will happen...

404
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,580
The steamed bun was first invented by Zhuge Liang during the Three Kingdoms period.

405
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,550
During a rough storm that kept him from crossing a river,

406
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,140
he threw nikuman into the raging waters and was able to pass!

407
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,740
As expected of the steamed bun!

408
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,340
Next time... "Aiya? It seems like something is going to happen!"

409
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,390
"This may surely bring an end to the world!" by Lingshen.

410
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,170
Oh! Will this be the nikuman's debut appearance?

411
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,920
Achou!

412
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,230
How was it?

413
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,060
Is help on the way?

414
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,660
No.

415
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,230
No?

416
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,280
Wasn't that the reason you went?

417
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,010
Instead, I came back with supplies.

418
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,780
Why, you!

419
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,730
Well whatever, I'm starving. Hand that over!
